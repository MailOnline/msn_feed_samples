Some of that they are finding online, and that is a great opportunity, but they are also finding a lot of innovation on the high street.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Mulcahy told MPs that technological change was key.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The latest escalation in the Tory chaos began at a gathering of the ERG in Westminster last night.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One source said the level of manouevring against the leader was 'amazing'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There were 50 people present, openly discussing how to get rid of the PM and literally no one said 'Oooh no, we mustn't talk about that',' they said.</p><mol-permabox id="mol-c2e5dc30-b690-11e8-b487-3f82c06655c6"></mol-permabox><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another source said the discussions continued even when Tory Party whips entered the room. 'It was brazen – really detailed discussion of how best you game the leadership rules.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said any MPs talking about challenging Mrs May were indulging in 'stupid personality nonsense'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He confirmed he was not at the meeting last night, adding: 'You get 50 MPs of any political party together and you're always going to get some that are going to start arguing the toss about ridiculous issues.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'All I would say to them is: Stop it, it's just stupid. If you've got nothing better to do, go and find yourself some work, because that's the best cure for stupid personality nonsense.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Speaking at the launch of the ERG's Irish border plan today, Mr Rees-Mogg said: 'I have long said, and repeated again and again, that the policy needs to be changed but I am supporting the person.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Theresa May has enormous virtues, she is a fantastically dutiful Prime Minister and she has my support. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I just want her to change one item of policy.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Asked at the same event about the prospect of changing leader, Mr Davis said 'we have got a very good' prime minister and he only disagreed with her on 'one issue'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: 'I have made very plain from when I resigned and thereafter that I think we have got a very good Prime Minister and, like Jacob, I disagree with her on one issue - this issue.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Environment Secretary Michael Gove, one of the leading figures in Vote Leave, urged his colleagues to back away from a confrontation or risk putting the whole Brexit project at risk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I urge everyone to get behind the PM. I think she is doing a great job at the moment,' he said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This is loose talk. The critical thing is to ensure that we deliver on that Brexit mandate.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Any diversion or any distraction from that mission means that our ability to ensure that the referendum mandate that we were given is delivered, is undermined.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Allies of Mrs May believe the ERG does not have the numbers to defeat her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One Cabinet minister told MailOnline that attempting a coup now would be 'crazy'.

]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>A Eurosceptic coup plot against Theresa May (left at PMQs today) collapsed today as leading Brexiteers were forced to swear loyalty to the Prime Minister. Members of the hardline European Research Group (ERG) openly discussed ousting Mrs May at a meting last night, amid speculation they want Boris Johnson (inset) to replace her. But the scheme backfired immediately as ERG leader Jacob Rees-Mogg and former Brexit Secretary David Davis had to swear allegiance to Mrs May. The duo were presenting the hard Brexiteers vision of how to make the Irish border work after Britain quits the EU and could not avoid questions. Leading Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith (right) branded the plotters 'stupid' after their actions overshadowed today's policy launch.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>James Tapsfield, Political Editor, For Mailonline and Jason Groves Political Editor For The Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-09-12T18:31:18.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Fifty Eurosceptic Tory MPs discuss how to oust Theresa May</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-09-12T18:31:18.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/12/14/501410BD00000578-0-image-a-92_1536758821155.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1000161</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>AFP/Getty Images</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6158557/Boris-looks-dishevelled-arrives-Oxfordshire-home.html" title="Rough night Boris?

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>A major new book by the Mail's royal writer outlines the diplomatic role undertaken by the <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/news/the_queen/index.html">Queen </a>during her unprecedented years of public service. </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Yesterday, he told what really happens when the royals embark on a foreign tour. </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Today, in the final part of our serialisation, he traces HM's own special relationship with the U.S.  </strong></p><img id="i-e4cbbb8a6a233c71" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/22/500B16CC00000578-0-image-a-36_1536701192508.jpg" height="408" width="634" alt="Gerald Ford dancing with Queen Elizabeth II at the ball at the White House, Washington, during the 1976 Bicentennial Celebrations of the Declaration of Independence" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">For her very first trip to Florida — part of her 1991 state visit to America — the Royal Yacht had sailed in to Miami to rendezvous with the Queen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As Britannia's crew waited to greet her, they flushed through all the royal baths and heads (ship's lavatories), which was standard practice ahead of a royal arrival. Whereupon Britannia's captain suddenly had a furious official from the Miami port authority thumping on his door.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The crew had just breached strict environmental regulations and the captain was handed a $10,000 (£7,700) fine plus an order to leave port within two hours.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No matter that the Queen was due to host a state banquet on board that very evening, with two former U.S. presidents among the guests. Rules were rules. The Yacht would have to pack up and go.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was only after the direct intervention of the White House that Britannia was allowed to remain alongside. The banquet duly took place without further incident.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> The fabled 'special relationship' had worked its magic once again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's a phrase, however, which is heard more often on this side of the Atlantic and there are commentators in both Britain and the U.S. who regard any notion of a 'special relationship' as sentimental, subservient wishful thinking on the part of the British Establishment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There have certainly been some strong individual pairings between No 10 and the White House, notably Churchill and Roosevelt, Thatcher and Reagan and, latterly, Blair and George W. Bush.</p><img id="i-f21384511b944c33" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/22/500B16C600000578-0-image-a-37_1536701252559.jpg" height="489" width="634" alt="Queen Elizabeth II rides on horseback with American President Ronald Reagan in Windsor, June 1982" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, historians will note that there has been a more subtle, yet more consistent, 'special relationship' operating between the White House and Buckingham Palace throughout the reign of Elizabeth II — even during periods of deep political division.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unlike the Queen's dealings with most countries, which have followed a well-established pattern, this is a friendship that has broken the bilateral mould. There can be few people in the U.S., let alone the rest of the world, who have lived through the administrations of 16 presidents — more than one-third of the total — and met 12 of them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of the handful of private foreign holidays that the Queen has enjoyed in her life (all horse-related), five have been spent in the U.S.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And in 2018, the Royal Family welcomed their first American Princess. Yet the Queen's own 'special relationship' goes back to the nursery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was in 1939 that her parents travelled to Canada and the U.S. to bolster support for Britain ahead of impending hostilities in Europe. The royals rather enjoyed all the informality.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Queen wrote an excited letter to her daughters about a memorable picnic lunch: 'All our food on one plate — a little salmon, some turkey, some ham, lettuce, beans &amp; HOT DOGS too!'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While some Americans were appalled at the idea of serving hot dogs to a king, the Royal Family would never forget it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Growing up in wartime Windsor, Princess Elizabeth was acutely aware of the strain on her father as he tried to buoy the morale of a nation facing invasion at any moment, and she could sense the redemptive significance of America's entry into the war.</p><img id="i-899f4fbd313e98a7" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/22/500B169600000578-0-image-m-41_1536701565674.jpg" height="823" width="634" alt="Queen Elizabeth signs on behalf of her dominion of Canada during the conclusion of the Power Project Ceremonies at the New York state end of the St. Lawrence Power Dam" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Come victory and the drab, near-bankrupt years of austerity that followed, it was America that represented fun and glamour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like so many others, the Princesses were entranced by the explosive arrival of the first American musical after the war, Oklahoma!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Princess Margaret reportedly went to see it more than 30 times. Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip watched it together as a courting couple in 1947; People Will Say We're in Love has been one of 'their' songs ever since.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Queen's first experience of the U.S. was in 1951, when as Princess Elizabeth she interrupted a tour of Canada to meet President Harry Truman at the White House. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her first visit as Queen came in 1957 when she met President Dwight D. Eisenhower as well as the then-Vice-President Richard Nixon.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alongside formalities to mark the 350th anniversary of the first English colony at Jamestown, Virginia, the Queen and the Duke paid their first visit to a supermarket. </p><img id="i-13b3cf4b9b715f84" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/11/4FE05F8C00000578-6152855-Pictured_The_Queen_of_the_World_by_Robert_Hardman-a-1_1536663598008.jpg" height="471" width="306" alt="Pictured: The Queen of the World by Robert Hardman " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'How nice you can bring your children along,' she told shoppers as she marvelled at the sight of a frozen-food section.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Food was also on the agenda in 1959 when the Queen first entertained a U.S. president at home. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Spending two days with the monarch at Balmoral, President Eisenhower found the experience so agreeable that he asked the Queen for 'her' scone recipe (though not her own, she duly transcribed it in her own hand).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Disagreements after the Suez Crisis and then over Vietnam would strain the 'special relationship' on the political front, but not the rapport between the Windsors and the White House.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 1976, Gerald Ford invited the Queen across the Atlantic for a tumultuous state visit to honour the bicentenary of American independence. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was accompanied by her new Foreign Secretary, Anthony Crosland, and his American-born wife, who later recorded the Queen's advice on how to get through arduous tours like these.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'One plants one's feet like this,' the Queen told her. 'Always keep them parallel. Make sure your weight is evenly distributed. That's all there is to it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The advice would be invaluable, with a punishing itinerary in 100f (38c) heat. The centrepiece was a White House state banquet for more than 200 guests, including Hollywood stars Cary Grant, Telly Savalas and Merle Oberon.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was some amusement when the after-dinner cabaret, pop duo Captain &amp; Tennille, launched into their moderately risque hit Muskrat Love. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That turned to considerable unamusement when President Ford invited the Queen to dance. The band chose that very moment to strike up a new tune: The Lady Is A Tramp.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was an even more awkward moment when Ford's successor arrived at Buckingham Palace a year later. Perhaps overcome with nerves on what was his first journey outside the U.S., Jimmy Carter became a little over-familiar with a senior member of the Royal Family.</p><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">As William Shawcross notes in her official biography, the Queen Mother hated being told that she reminded people of their own mothers. Having informed her that she did, indeed, remind him of his own mother — 'Miz Lillian' — President Carter kissed the Queen Mother on the lips. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As she later remarked, no one had done that since the death of George VI. 'I took a sharp step backwards,' she recalled, 'not far enough.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Carter's successor, however, would enjoy one of the more enduring friendships between the Queen and any foreign politician. It certainly helped that Ronald Reagan was an accomplished horseman. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When he came to Windsor Castle for a semi-private stay in 1982, the two heads of state spent a good hour riding all over Windsor Great Park followed by teams of bodyguards — on both four legs and four wheels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On a return trip to the U.S. in 1983, the Queen fulfilled a lifetime's ambition of touring the West Coast. In Hollywood, Reagan laid on a star-packed lunch for 500. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The entertainment included Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope and Perry Como, but the arrangements left some of the local talent rather peeved.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Ronald Reagan was asked who should be at the top table,' recalls Sir Brian Fall, then private secretary to the British Foreign Secretary, Francis Pym. 'Should it be actor friends or political friends? He couldn't sort it out so he said: 'Why don't we pack it out with Brits in Hollywood?' '</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The result was a top table full of British-born stars such as Julie Andrews and Dudley Moore. For some status-obsessed Hollywood egos, it was all too much. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Palace press office, which had played no part in the planning, was left fending off accusations that the Queen was only interested in sitting with fellow Brits.</p><img id="i-233e62c8a08e9d01" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/22/500B16A000000578-0-image-m-42_1536701617075.jpg" height="803" width="634" alt="Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh this afternoon arrived in Washington D.C. where they were greeted by President Eisenhower" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I was on the table next door with Julie Andrews's husband,' Sir Brian recalls. 'He was so ticked off at not being on the right table that he walked off and left a gap.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A few days later the Queen was due to arrive in San Francisco on Britannia, but foul weather persuaded her to fly instead. The Reagans put Air Force Two at her disposal and staff recall a very excited Queen pressing her face against a plane window to enjoy an aerial view of the Golden Gate Bridge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With no Royal Yacht to stay on, the combined power of the White House, the Palace and the personal contacts of the former state governor found the Queen and the Duke last-minute accommodation in the Presidential Suite at the St Francis Hotel, where Nancy Reagan even arranged for works of art from local museums to be rounded up and hung on the walls.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The next question was: where to go for dinner?' remembers Sir Brian. Again the White House came to the rescue and managed to empty San Francisco's most famous restaurant, Trader Vic's, for the night. For the Queen, who had not eaten in a restaurant for 15 years, it was a novel experience, right down to being given a fortune cookie at the end (she read the message and then put it in her handbag).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 'special relationship' was still in robust shape following the first Gulf War as the Queen and Prince Philip arrived to stay with President George H. W. Bush in 1991.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the state visit got off to an inauspicious start following President Bush's formal welcome on the White House lawn. After his speech, he was supposed to press a pedal which raised the platform from which the Queen was then going to speak.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> He forgot to do it and the Queen, being rather shorter, remained invisible to much of the crowd.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The moment was encapsulated in the words of NBC's Jim Miklaszewski: 'She's gone! All I got is a talking hat!' To this day, Palace officials and diplomats still refer to the state visit as 'the talking hat tour'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">D uring her stay in Washington, the Queen had her first encounter with the President's son, George W. Bush, then in charge of the Texas Rangers baseball team. He had been forewarned by his mother not to talk to the Queen, as he could be 'mercurial'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Queen was rather intrigued, particularly since he was wearing cowboy boots etched with the words 'God Save The Queen'. At one point she asked him if he was the black sheep of the family.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I guess so,' replied Bush Junior.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'All families have them,' observed the Queen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Who's yours?' Bush Junior replied, at which point the First Lady, Barbara Bush, intervened with a cry of: 'Don't answer that!'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Relations between London and Washington cooled to a more business-like level during the Clinton years, partly because of heated disagreements over the Western response to war in Bosnia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was no state visit in either direction in that sort of climate, but the Queen fulfilled her now-familiar role as keeper of the 'special relationship'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Clintons might not have had the full royal treatment at Windsor or Buckingham Palace but, in 1994, they were the Queen's guests for the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of D-Day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Only the Clintons were invited to stay aboard Britannia in Portsmouth ahead of the voyage to France the next day, accompanied by the leaders of all the allied nations and ocean liners packed with veterans.</p><img id="i-1d12bf7e46405c70" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/22/500B16AC00000578-0-image-a-40_1536701343521.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Queen Elizabeth II stands with US President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, in the Grand Corridor during their visit to Windsor Castle in Berkshire" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font"> They were given cabins nine and 11, the best suite apart from the Queen's. A presidential bodyguard took up position at the door and refused to let anyone inside, including the steward bringing the Clintons' morning coffee.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The President was up early for his exercise routine. No one could fail to spot him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Sir Robert Woodard, Britannia's captain, he put on 'these DayGlo neoprene things' for a short run around the dockyard.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He did his post-running press-ups and hip jerks for quite literally five minutes with the whole yacht standing to attention,' laughs Woodard. 'Then he went down and was politely late for breakfast.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Only a handful of senior members of the Royal Household were at the breakfast table, along with the Duke of Edinburgh. One recalls the extraordinary moment when Clinton began to describe the World War II ceremonies he had attended at battlefields in Italy the previous day:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He was talking about visiting the U.S. graves at Anzio and suddenly he burst into tears — which was unexpected.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would be George W. Bush who became the first American president to pay a full state visit to the United Kingdom when he arrived with his wife, Laura, in 2003. The second would be President Obama in 2011, but planning a U.S. state visit would turn out to be somewhat more problematic by the time the 45th President began his administration.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just weeks after Donald Trump's inauguration in 2017, Theresa May travelled to Washington to meet him. She duly issued an invitation — promptly accepted — for a state visit in the near future.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The plan stalled, however, due to the threat of protests from activists and politicians such as Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, who said that such a state visit would 'embarrass' the Queen and the country.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the event, the President made an 'official' visit in July 2018 and was invited, with the First Lady, for tea with the Queen at Windsor (mindful of American tastes, there was plenty of coffee, too).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">T here was not the faintest possibility that the Queen would be 'embarrassed' in this way. According to one of her staff, she would be intrigued to encounter a head of state who, like her, had a Scottish mother and who, like her, happens to own a large area of Scottish countryside (Balmoral in her case and a pair of golf courses in Trump's).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The tea party — in the Oak Room in the Queen's private quarters — overran by 20 minutes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whether Donald Trump will get round to a full state visit remains to be seen but, regardless, the White House-Palace connection seems certain to endure.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox news" data-version="2" id="mol-f6437610-b608-11e8-a649-df1cec79f1c7">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Even the threat of assassination didn't stop her...</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">The Queen had the unlikeliest of fans in the Cuban Communist dictator Fidel Castro.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to a story told by Sir Sonny Ramphal, former Commonwealth Secretary-General, one Left-wing Caribbean leader was so keen to get into Castro's good graces that he confided in him that he was thinking of turning his country into a republic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He thought it would go down well with Fidel. But Fidel said: 'Why? Does the Queen interfere?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Prime Minister: 'No.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Castro: 'Then why would you do that? You want to be a big tourist island and she's good for showing off your stability. Why are you doing that?' '</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite this acknowledgement of the monarch's usefulness, reports emerged of a plot by Castro to assassinate the Queen at the 1979 Commonwealth summit in Zambia, then a one-party state under President Kenneth Kaunda.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The crunch debate at the summit was to be over white minority rule in neighbouring Rhodesia, an issue causing much division among Commonwealth leaders.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Queen's would-be assassins, it was alleged, hoped to pin the blame on Rhodesia's white leaders and generate enough international outrage to bring down their regime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 'plot' would later turn out to be nonsense. But, alerted to this and other threats, Downing Street expressed serious reservations about despatching the Queen to a maelstrom of African violence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was, however, one compelling argument in favour of this ostensibly suicidal royal tour: the Queen was very much looking forward to it. As Head of the Commonwealth, she was determined to join the rest of the 'club' in Lusaka, with the Duke of Edinburgh at her side, and 19-year-old Prince Andrew, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They were already doing their packing and the British High Commission was bombarded with questions, including what Prince Andrew would need for his safari.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back came the reply: 'Normal bush wear and stout shoes. Mosquito nets will be provided.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were weeks of tension between the Palace and senior Government officials until finally, on July 17, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the Commons that her mind was made up: she was not going to tell the Queen not to go to Zambia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was just as well, because two days later the monarch was on her way, arriving in time to deal with an explosive speech prepared by Kaunda. Some of its more incendiary passages were likely to cause terrible divisions within the Commonwealth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Queen intervened personally with Kaunda and the controversial text miraculously disappeared. This set the scene for a harmonious summit at which history was made with Mrs Thatcher's announcement that she would be working with all the parties involved to deliver 'genuine black majority rule' in Rhodesia as quickly as possible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We are often told 'the Queen does not do politics'— and indeed she does not.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But over seven decades on the throne, there have been moments when she has strayed close to the line. On this occasion, she was willing to cross it.</p>                            </div>                        </div><div class="art-ins mol-factbox news" data-version="2" id="mol-1989aac0-b633-11e8-abfb-d1b6995f220e">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Rule No.1: NEVER say yes to a gift horse! </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">When organising visits for the Prince of Wales, the Foreign Office's Royal Visits Committee knows to expect a certain amount of haggling.

Sure enough, the ancient Uzbek cities of Samarkand and Bukhara featured prominently on the final itinerary.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps the most challenging leg was in Turkmenistan, where the Prince spent the evening at the pink palace of the country's horse-obsessed dictator, President Saparmurat Niyazov.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As well as banning dogs and pop music, he was in the habit of presenting visiting dignitaries with horses, a serious problem for the recipients.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Foreign Office had been left to sort out the mess when, during a stopover in 1993, John Major was given a horse called Maksat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eventually, it was brought to Britain, at great expense, but proved wholly unfit for official duties.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although Maksat finally ended up living happily on a Welsh farm, the Foreign Office had one clear instruction for the Prince's officials: no more horses.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This made for a tense evening as Niyazov led the Prince down to a vast  equestrian arena, where an energetic display of Turkmeni horsemanship was laid on for his benefit. As the two men walked through the stables, Niyazov sang the praises of one horse after another.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It looked increasingly likely that the Prince was about to be offered one at any minute. Yet the royal guest managed to dodge every presidential blandishment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Craftily observing how impressed he was that the President could manage so many horses, when he himself had too many to look after and frequently rubbing the 'bad back' which made riding painful these days, he managed to leave Niyazov's pink palace at the end of a 22-course banquet with nothing more awkward than a pom-pom hat and a carpet.</p>                            </div>                        </div><div class="art-ins mol-factbox news" data-version="2" id="mol-1db441a0-b633-11e8-abfb-d1b6995f220e">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">How Camilla's husband saved rival Charles' life </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <img id="i-2ac5b5ca4d2fd847" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/12/03/500E51EB00000578-6157131-image-a-9_1536720277170.jpg" height="364" width="284" alt="Andrew Parker Bowles in his army days" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Spring 1980, a year before his marriage to Lady Diana Spencer, and the Prince of Wales was on his way to Rhodesia for the hand-over ceremony which would herald its rebirth as independent Zimbabwe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Arrangements for the royal visit had been made by one Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Parker Bowles and he had invited out his wife Camilla who, as the newspapers wasted no time in pointing out, was the Prince's former girlfriend.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Charles's old flame lights up darkest Zimbabwe,' the Daily Mail's Nigel Dempster reported.
