As he escaped, a member of Tout's family shouted 'he's innocent!'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tout is described as white, 5ft 8ins, with short brown hair, and was wearing a white top and dark trousers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Superintendent Paul Moxley said: 'We have launched a thorough search for Tout and would urge the public if they see him to contact police immediately.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Anyone who is knowingly assisting Tout or harbouring him should also expect to be arrested.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rapist managed to vault over  the three-foot dock, before he crashed into a wall  and sprinted through a narrow corridor and out of the courtroom.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was then able to avoid security officers and sprint through the metal detectors.

He then carried out another attack in what was described as an isolated location near Warndon Villages in Worcester. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The case was prosecuted by Steven Bailey who said in his opening: 'This case is about the sexual exploitation of a 16-year-old girl. You will hear evidence of pretty seedy, sordid behaviour. There are no hearts and flowers in this case. Romeo and Juliet it isn't.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The defendants claimed the victim was 'up for it' and wanted a 'threesome'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet the girl said she did not consent to sex with Tout in front of Odedra, who was a stranger to her. She said she repeatedly had to stop Odedra's attempts by pushing his hand away.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said: 'I felt upset that I had been used. They were just passing me around just like I was this piece of meat.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The victim took photographs of her body after the attack which revealed bruising. She claimed they were sustained as Odedra slapped her as she was raped by Tout.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The court heard how Odedra had previous convictions, including possession of an offensive weapon on school premises and wounding. Tout had convictions for criminal damage, driving offences, assaulting a constable and battery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The prosecution argued the starting sentence should be up to 13 years behind bars, before adding that there was a higher degree of culpability due to the level of planning behind the attacks. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sexual harm prevention orders will be imposed on Tout and Odedra, which will prohibit contact with the victim and any contact with a child under the age of 18, including being in a car with people under 18.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The sentence of Tout and Odedra is scheduled to take place today. The judge said if Tout had not been apprehended by then he would be sentenced in his absence. </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Bradley Tout, 20, (left) jumped over the dock at Worcester Crown Court (right) and managed to escape from prison guards.

Wednesday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Berchem claims to be in possession of texts that show Kavanaugh was preparing a defense against Ramirez's claims with friends before they were printed in the New Yorker on September 23.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If true, those texts would seem to contradict sworn testimony Kavanaugh gave to senators when he said the first time he heard of the

The victims' families reported the girls missing to police. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Singh, who is also known as Mike Singh, is believed to have contacted other young girls on Instagram and Leicestershire police are appealing for any other victims to come forward. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After pleading guilty to child abduction charges, Singh was handed a 27-month jail term for each count. He has also banned from driving for 27 months and issued with a 10-year Sexual Harm Prevention Order at Leicester Crown Court. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trial judge Robert Brown also ordered Singh hand over his mobile phone which was due to be destroyed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was also handed two further three-month sentences for breaching two restraining orders in connection with an unrelated incident. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was also given an unlimited restraining order. </p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The three-month jail term for breaching the restraining order will run consecutively to the child abduction offences.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">PC Tim Grigg of Leicestershire Police's Child Sexual Exploitation team said: 'Evidence uncovered during the investigation revealed Singh was grooming young girls under the age of 16 using social media. In this case Singh took the victims out without their parents’ permission and bought gifts and food.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We are pleased Singh has pleaded guilty to the offences and spared the young victims the ordeal of giving evidence in court.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We believe there may be other victims of Singh. On social media he has been known to use the name "Mike Singh" - if you recognise the defendant or have been approached in a similar way we would ask that you contact us.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Staying safe online is important to stop you from being a target. You should never give out your personal details online to people you don’t know. You should never agree to meet up with someone that you’ve met online, particularly in a private place or without your family knowing. Doing so can make it possible for an online groomer to hurt you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If you talk to the police we will work alongside social workers to support you so you can tell us what happened. We have specially trained officers who will listen to what you have to say. They will then explain to you what will happen next and make sure that you’re happy with it. We won’t make you do anything you don’t want to. But we will always take action to make sure you or another child is safe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If there’s an adult you trust, a parent, carer, friend or a teacher, talk to them first about what’s happening.

When a stroke led him to put the camera down, his wife Jane began to catalogue and digitalise the images. After she died in 2011, their three sons William, Edward and George, along with his brother Johnny, continued on the pursuit to get the photos out. </p><img id="i-c51ac548e8d261ba" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/04/08/4751786-6238681-image-a-1_1538637490229.jpg" height="724" width="962" alt="Childhood friends: Blomfield's tender nature meant that he was able to capture some of the sweetest moments shared with friends, including this one of four children walking down the street in Edinburgh in 1966" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-226b144c5a2f4325" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/04/08/4751792-6238681-image-a-10_1538637554011.jpg" height="734" width="470" alt="This winter the City Art Centre showcases an exhibition of vintage street photography by Robert Blomfield" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-25628e9368c20fc4" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/04/08/4751794-6238681-image-m-9_1538637547234.jpg" height="734" width="470" alt="This winter the City Art Centre showcases an exhibition of vintage street photography by Robert Blomfield" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-2c7e159728f4eb14" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/04/08/4751788-6238681-image-a-11_1538637559572.jpg" height="635" width="962" alt="It's easy to forget when looking at these images that Blomfield was also studying medicine.

The Prime Minister vowed the decade-long squeeze on public spending was finally over as she rallied the Tory party in Birmingham yesterday. But Paul Johnson, boss of the influential Institute for Fiscal Studies, warned today Mrs May would have to raise taxes or borrow money to meet the promise. Mrs May's promise to spend more comes after the Government already vowed to spend £20billion a year more on the NHS and raise public sector pay. Chancellor Philip Hammond must start to make the sums add up at his Budget on October 29 - but is likely to postpone the hardest decisions until next year's spending review. Raising borrowing could mean the fall in the deficit (pictured inset) stops before Britain ever gets back in the black.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Tim Sculthorpe, Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-04T11:50:54.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>IFS: Ending austerity means May will have to find ANOTHER £20billion</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-04T11:50:54.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6234589/Arlene-Foster-warns-blood-red-line-Brexit-deal.html" title="DUP leader Arlene Foster warns May she has a 'blood red' line against any Brexit deal that treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6234767/Queues-Theresa-speech-bigger-Boris-Johnsons.html" title="Mamma May-A!

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Zoe Ball has become the BBC's highest paid woman after being handed a £1.2million a year salary to host the Radio 2 Breakfast Show, according to reports. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rise of almost £1million was agreed after several weeks of complex regulations, with bosses hoping to make savings on Chris Evans' £1.69million pay packet but fearful that slashing too heavily would raise equal pay questions, it is claimed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Miss Ball's previous salary was officially disclosed as between £250,000 to £300,000 for her work on Radio 2 and presenting Strictly spin-off It Takes Two.</p><img id="i-4361d492ccd5e950" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/03/09/4721812-6234417-image-m-103_1538555590440.jpg" height="449" width="634" alt="Chris Evans yesterday unveiled Zoe Ball as his replacement and posed for this photo after the show - and today it was reported she will be getting a £1.2million salary " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">A source told <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/7410048/zoe-ball-1-2million-chris-evans-radio-2-breakfast/">The Sun</a>: 'Zoe was very much the BBC's frontrunner and they began negotiations some time ago.

I am very very happy with what the BBC are paying me. If it comes out, and usually these things do, I hope people will look at it and think: 'That's fair'.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The star has admitted being terrified and excited about taking over and told listeners: 'I hope you're not too disappointed' - a nod to those who had wanted Sara Cox to get the job.</p><div class="item">

It's amazing". </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She added: 'He looked into my eyes and held my hand and said 'Someone will listen'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her younger daughter Nelly could be more difficult to win over, telling Ball: 'I'll probably listen to Greg (James on Radio 1) but if he plays a bad record mummy I might listen to you to see if you're alright.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Zoe, who currently earns £300,000 a year for her show, has been picked over her former best friend, 'ladette' Sara Cox, 43, who was until recently the favourite for the job.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The decision will be a devastating blow for Cox, who has been open about her desire to move from her 10pm slot into the flagship role.  <br /> </p><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">They paint a picture of vast wealth matched by equally questionable accounting, all for the benefit of Fred Trump and his family. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Donald Trump and his siblings, one Fred Trump tax return showed, claimed 25 apartment complexes with 6,988 apartments were worth only $41 million. Less than a decade later, in 2004, banks valued them at $900 million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump was able to bank a total of $413 million from his father's empire partly through those tax 'dodges.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the tender age of three, Trump was earning $200,000 a year in 2018 dollars from his dad's business empire, becoming a millionaire by age 8, according to the report.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By the time he graduated college – the Wharton School of Finance, as Trump likes to point out – he was getting $1 million a year in today's dollars – an amount that would jump to $5 million a year by the time he hit his 40s.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The transfers and undervaluations had the effect of allowing the Trump children to avoid potential gift taxes, and also estate taxes, based on the assets' full value.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Responded Trump lawyer Charles Harder: 'Should The Times state or imply that President Trump participated in fraud, tax evasion or any other crime, it will be exposing itself to substantial liability and damages for defamation.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harder distanced Trump and pointed the finger at lawyers and accountants. 'President Trump had virtually no involvement whatsoever with these matters. The affairs were handled by other Trump family members who were not experts themselves and therefore relied entirely upon the aforementioned licensed professionals to ensure full compliance with the law.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As the story exploded across the airwaves and the Internet, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders attacked the story and complained that the paper 'can rarely find anything positive' to say about Trump – but did not seek to rebut specific allegations such as the avoidance of hundreds of millions in gift taxes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Fred Trump has been gone for nearly twenty years and it's sad to witness this misleading attack against the Trump family by the failing New York Times. Many decades ago the IRS reviewed and signed off on these transactions,' she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The New York Times' and other media outlets' credibility with the American people is at an all time low because they are consumed with attacking the president and his family 24/7 instead of reporting the news,' she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The truth is the market is at an all-time high, unemployment is at a fifty year low, taxes for families and businesses have been cut, wages are up, farmers and workers are empowered from better trade deals, and America's military is stronger than ever, yet the New York Times can rarely find anything positive about the President and his tremendous record of success to report. Perhaps another apology from the New York Times, like the one they had to issue after they got the 2016 election so embarrassingly wrong, is in order,' she concluded.</p><div>

She alleges in a sworn statement released last week by her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, that she witnessed Kavanaugh ‘consistently engage in excessive drinking and inappropriate contact of a sexual nature with women in the early 1980s.’</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.com</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-04T06:16:19.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>University suspends dean for tweet critical of Kavanaugh accuser</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-04T06:16:19.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6238025/Kavanaughs-ex-roommate-says-SCOTUS-nominee-lied-oath.html" title="'He has shown contempt for the truth': Kavanaugh's freshman year roommate says the SCOTUS nominee 'lied under oath' to senators about drinking and his yearbook "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6238143/Senate-moves-ahead-Kavanaughs-SCOTUS-nomination-Republicans-set-key-vote-Friday.html" title="Kavanaugh could be voted on to SCOTUS as early as SATURDAY NIGHT after Republicans set up procedural vote for Friday"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2018/09/28/catholic-u-dean-apologizes-comment-that-degraded-woman-who-accused-kavanaugh-sexual-assault/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.e6232251b8ae" title="Catholic U. dean suspended after comment that ‘degraded’ a woman who accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault"></link></item><item><title>Jets running back Isaiah Crowell is fined $13K for wiping his butt with football in touchdown celebration - but gains endorsement deal</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6238317/Jets-running-Isaiah-Crowell-fined-13K-wiping-butt-football.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Oct 2018 04:29:30 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6238317</guid><description><![CDATA[After scoring a touchdown against the Cleveland Browns on September 20, Crowell took the football and wiped it against his rear end before firing it into the stands.

'Wow, such enthusiasm and energy for Judge Brett Kavanaugh,' Trump posted. 'Look at the Energy, look at the Polls. Something very big is happening. He is a fine man and great intellect. The country is with him all the way!' Trump's Twitter post has been re-tweeted more than seven thousand times and includes just as many comments - with most people disagreeing with him. The president's comment comes one day after he mocked Christine Blasey Ford, Kavanaugh's first accuser.

Melissa Cochran (pictured) suffered a severely broken leg, broke three ribs, as well as her back in three places, and lacerations to her head and thigh but survived the attack after Kurt Cochran (pictured left and top right) pushed her out of the way of the oncoming truck. The US tourist opened up about her loving husband in an interview today, revealing he would have sacrificed his life bravely for anyone. Mr Cochran was the hit and killed by the speeding Hyundai Tucson, which propelled him over the bridge and onto the pavement below. In an interview with the BBC she said Mr Cochran would have acted instinctively to protect her, or anybody else who was in danger. Despite the loss of her husband, Mrs Cochran says she feels sorry for killer Masood. Speaking from her home in Utah, Ms Cochran said she 'can only imagine the heartbreak' they feel at the murders the terrorist committed. Masood, 52, from Kent, embarked on a 82-second rampage on March 22 last year, killing Mr Cochran, three other members of the public and Pc Keith Palmer.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Rod Ardehali For Mailonline</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-04T07:36:24.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Wife pays tribute to husband who died in Westminster terror attack</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-04T07:36:24.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content></item><item><title>Homeowner is shocked to find a sneaky two-metre snake hiding in her VERY cluttered sewing room - so can you spot it?</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6237721/Homeowner-Queensland-gets-shock-finds-snake-cluttered-sewing-room.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Oct 2018 00:37:15 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6237721</guid><description><![CDATA[A Queensland homeowner got an unexpected shock after she found a sneaky snake hiding in her very cluttered sewing room.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The Senate will receive the anticipated results of the federal bureau supplemental background investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh early Thursday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Republican lawmakers will take part in the initial review of the restricted, single copy report between 8am-9am, with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman, Chuck Grassley, to begin the analysis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By 9am, Democratic senators will have access the report, with California Senator Dianne Feinstein to start. Senators are not permitted to discuss the contents of the document.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Following  initial review, all 100 senators will alternate. Alternating one copy of an FBI report between senators is typical for judicial nominees, Republican aides said in a statement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The review of the 302 form will take place in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having the single copy viewed in a secure room will supposedly help to stop leaks, which are expected to hit within seconds of the document arriving in the building, if not before. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On Wednesday evening, Kavanaugh faced dramatic new claims  that the FBI have <span class="mol-style-underline">already</span> warned senators about his sexual behavior in a shock letter written by Democrats.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee said they had seen information in the six background checks already performed by the FBI into the embattled nominee which suggested problems around sexual conduct.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It came as farcical details of how senators will be given the latest background check emerged.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the dramatic warning from Democrats about Kavanaugh's conduct, they declined to say what it was, saying the information they had already seen was not for public release.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But referring to twin tweets from the Senate Judiciary Committee's official Twitter account which said that the FBI's previously background checks had come up clean on sexual and alcohol issues, the Democrats said that was wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'While we are limited in what we can say about this background investigation in a public setting, we are compelled to state for the record that there is information in the second post that is not accurate,' they said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The second post had said 'nowhere... was there ever a whiff of ANY issue - at all - related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Democrats went on to make clear that they were referring to sexual conduct by saying: 'Unfortunately, this is not the first instance of Committee Majority staff mischaracterizing or selectively disclosing information regarding the allegations of sexual misconduct by Judge Kavanaugh.' </p><img id="i-6b5e968b58fd686d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/02/23/4715908-6231497-image-a-53_1538519307282.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Why hasn't she been asked: Christine Blasey Ford's attorneys Debra Katz and Michael Bromwich wrote to the FBI warning she had not been contacted at all" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-aabe3ee0a37df515" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/04/00/4701748-6237573-image-a-34_1538607850560.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Already warned?

The committee stands by its statement, which is completely truthful. More baseless innuendo and more false smears from Senate Democrats.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Democrats also sought to get a green light to disclose how many people get interviewed in the latest, additional background check – achieved after Democrats joined with GOP Sen. Jeff Flake to require one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Top Judiciary Democrat Dianne Feinstein issued her own angry letter Wednesday complaining that the White House was keeping the FBI from interviewing Ford and Kavanaugh. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That came after growing questions over why Ford had not been interviewed by the FBI, and suggestions it was because restrictive White House guidance had told the bureau that they should simply rely on what she and Kavanaugh had told senators.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the White House Sarah Huckabee Sanders appeared to at least partially confirm that suggestion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I can also tell you that both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford were questioned in the most public way possible by the members of the Senate, who are ultimately the ones who have to make the determination on whether or not they vote for Judge Kavanaugh,' said Sanders. 'If they had additional questions for either one of them, they had a time and an opportunity, certainly, to ask those.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Feinstein told DailyMail.com Wednesday afternoon she did not know whether Ford would get interviewed. 'She should be,' she said. </p><img id="i-1fa44f4c428286fb" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/04/00/4748448-6237573-image-m-41_1538609159326.jpg" height="418" width="306" alt="Previous background issues: Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, signed the letter" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The FBI is quickly wrapping up its investigation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The bureau does not at this time plan to produce any overarching analysis or conclusions of what it finds following an interview process that began Friday after a dramatic compromise hatched in the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, GOP Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee said, they will simply turn over a stack of '302s,' the forms the bureau produces during background interviews.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'These are 302s.

There never has been expected to be findings,' Corker said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'What we think is going to happen they're going to transmit a stack of 302s where they went and talked to people.

It's possible that they have conflicting accounts, I hope that's not the case.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The FBI report will be available for senators to read starting Thursday morning but Republicans are putting strict restrictions on its viewing: only one copy will be available and it will be kept in a locked safe with a log reflecting who checks it out to read it - supposedly to stop leaks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Senators have to take turns examining the findings: Republicans will get it for one hour, then Democrats the next hour with the two parties switching back and forth throughout the day,<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/409786-senators-will-view-fbi-report-on-kavanaugh-thursday?__twitter_impression=true"> The Hill </a> reported.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the report will be held in one of the most secure areas of the Capitol complex: the Senate SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility), which is a classified area in the basement of the Capitol Visitor's Center where lawmakers have to check their electronic devices at the door.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Only senators will be able to read the details of the FBI findings into the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh. None of their staff will be permitted to see them – a move likely done to try and cut down the odds of the findings leaking to the press as the report will not be made public.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But 10 staffers on the Senate Judiciary Committee will have access to the report, which is in paper form only - there are no PDFs or emails of it, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/who-s-allowed-read-fbi-s-confidential-kavanaugh-report-how-n916441?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma">NBC News</a> reported, and those staff will be available to brief senators on it should they not have time to read it for themselves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How they will be stopped from simply photographing it on their iPhones is unclear.

If the Committee Majority is going to violate that confidentiality and characterize this background investigation publicly, you must at least be honest about it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unfortunately, this is not the first instance of Committee Majority staff mischaracterizing or selectively disclosing information regarding the allegations of sexual misconduct by Judge Kavanaugh. While Republican Senators have falsely claimed without evidence that Committee Minority staff leaked Dr. Ford's letter alleging that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her, Committee Majority staff have publicly claimed that you possess evidence undermining the allegations while only selectively disclosing that evidence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, the Majority has released an 'investigative timeline' that editorializes about information in the Majority's possession in a blatant effort to undermine the credibility of the women who have come forward.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite Dr. Ford's unequivocal sworn statement that she is '100 percent' certain that it was Judge Kavanaugh who attacked her, the Majority's 'timeline' describes statements from two unidentified men who purportedly claim they, not Judge Kavanaugh, assaulted Dr. Ford; however, the Majority has not shared these alleged anonymous statements with the Minority despite repeated requests. This selective public disclosure sends a clear message from Senate Republicans to sexual assault survivors: if you have the courage to step forward, we will attack your credibility.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Weare concerned that there may be similar effort to publicly mischaracterize or selectively leak, for partisan purposes, the results of the FBI's ongoing supplemental background investigation into Judge Kavanaugh. To avoid this possibility, we urge you to call for a full Senate briefing with the FBI onthe results of their re-opened investigation so that all Senators hear the same information and have the same opportunity to question the FBI before any floor vote on the Kavanaugh nomination.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We also urge you to meet with Minority members of the Judiciary Committee in advance of that briefing to establish bipartisan ground rules for public discussion of the information provided by the FBI. For example, we assume that since the Majority has already tweeted publicly about how many people were interviewed for Kavanaugh's previous background investigations, the Majority also will permit the public disclosure of the number of people interviewed by the FBI for the supplemental background investigation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is critical to the integrity of the United States Senate and the Supreme Court that the American people have confidence in the FBI's supplemental background investigation of Judge Kavanaugh. There has long been a tradition of bipartisan cooperation regarding the handling of confidential background information on judicial nominees. We look forward to working with you to restore this bipartisan tradition.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thank you for your attention to this important matter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sincerely  </p></div>                        </div><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">News of that the investigation is in its final hours comes as attorneys for Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford complain their client has not been contacted for an interview. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, they would contain rough summaries of information provided by the six or more people FBI agents have contacted, under a deal being closely monitored by the White House and GOP senators.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Such 302 documents contain an FBI agent's notes on information a witness provides. They don't contain analysis comparing the statements to what another witness may have said, or otherwise offer a conclusion – meaning if senators are looking for an answer on the key question of who is telling the truth, Kavanaugh or Ford, the documents very well may not provide it.</p><div>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The 28 extremely small residents of the Munchkins Miniature Shetland Rescue Centre toss their teeny heads, stamp their tiny hooves and swish their shaggy manes in the golden afternoon sun like little princes and princesses.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From a distance, it seems they glow with good health.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their tummies are round and full. Their eyes are bright. Their spirits are high — judging by the odd well-aimed kick or lunge. And their appetites are insatiable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They eat all day, every day — munch, munch, munch —barely lifting their heads to take in the stunning views from their pasture.</p><img id="i-fc4228d947cab93d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/03/22/4746270-0-image-a-33_1538602947046.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Miniature Shetland ponies running through a meadow. Over time they have been bred smaller and smaller, to barely 38 inches high" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But these miniature Shetland ponies have been through seven circles of hell.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many have been physically and mentally abused. Some were abandoned in water-logged fields, sheds or outhouses; left tethered, thin and louse-ridden, in car parks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Others spent years cooped up in suburban back gardens — neglected pets that had lost their novelty value — before being offered on second-hand websites for as little as a fiver.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All are victims of people’s obsession with dinkier ponies. They have been bred smaller and smaller, to barely 38 inches high — not slowly over time by evolution, but quickly by unregulated breeders to meet a passing fad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Closer up, the scars are visible. Butterscotch, a gorgeous cream dun, has an open wound on his face where horse-sized teeth far too big for his miniature head have caused an abscess. The six-year-old is scheduled for an operation next week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, mis-shapen bones in their hind legs cause Teddy and Felicity such pain they’re struggling to walk.</p><img id="i-48f3976914aaba5e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/03/22/4746266-0-image-a-34_1538602951244.jpg" height="357" width="634" alt="A comparison showing a full sized horse with a tiny Shetland Pony.

They are the equine equivalent of miniature hand-bag dogs, or pugs with faces so trendily flat that the poor, benighted animals struggle to breathe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The trigger for the Shetland crisis appears to have been two adverts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One, in 2013, was for the mobile phone firm Three, in which, thanks to special effects, a Shetland pony appears to be dancing to a Fleetwood Mac song.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The second, far more damaging, was an Amazon advert in which a miniature Shetland with dwarfism was shown popping in and out of a cat flap and watching television. Suddenly, it seemed, everyone wanted a pet pony — and the smaller the better.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘If you look at the advert in detail, not only is the pony a dwarf Shetland, you can see it’s lame,’ says Tammy, 50. ‘Shetlands with dwarfism are the least healthy — with a dish face, pot-belly, short limbs and sarcoids (viral or cancerous growths).’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But people who ooh-ed and ah-ed at the adverts didn’t realise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All they could see was an impossibly cute horse that could join their family as a designer pet, be saddled up for their tot to ride, cost next to nothing to care for and even mow the grass into the bargain. </p><div class="item">

Some were abandoned in water-logged fields, sheds or outhouses; left tethered, thin and louse-ridden, in car parks" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘They call them “lawn-mowers” but they’re not even supposed to eat much grass,’ says Tammy. ‘Some people might take them out for a walk on a lead, like a dog. But lots didn’t bother.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The fact is that Shetlands couldn’t be less suited to suburban life. They’re designed to roam remote Scottish islands, foraging for seaweed, scrub and thin, marine grass — not be idling in suburban back gardens. ‘The poorer the grass, the happier they are,’ says Tammy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While small in stature, they need lots of exercise and space — the same as a fully-grown horse — or they soon become overweight with diabetes and joint problems.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some become so fat that their legs can no longer support them and they have to be put to sleep.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Laminitis, which is incredibly painful, can be fatal and, at the least, will need to be managed for the pony’s entire life. They should live for about 40 years (the oldest Shetland on record is 54). But as a result of the unregulated overbreeding to make them still smaller, they end up suffering from all sorts of horrific medical complaints.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So the vicious circle continues. Treated like pets — given sweet morsels and dragged about on leads — they can quickly become difficult and prone to kicking and biting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Children, of course, outgrow them. They suffer endless health problems, yet few owners are happy to pay £45 a month to insure them for vets’ bills. As Tammy says, Shetlands are cheeky and wilful — ‘some people would say stubborn’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And they’re strong — they were originally bred to carry farmers across the Shetland Isles.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While a super-cute, teeny young horse can go for up to £3,000, an unloved older horse with laminitis and diabetes has no resale value.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The market is saturated so many end up as dog food. The lucky ones find themselves in rescue centres such as Munchkins. Tammy has been horse-mad since childhood, but it was the horsemeat scandal (when it was revealed that meat products in supermarkets routinely contained horsemeat) in 2013 that galvanised her to set up Munchkins.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The setting is spectacular — 12 acres of Devon pasture owned by Tammy and her husband Paul, 65, a former maths teacher who had hoped to enjoy a relaxing retirement of golfing and gardening.</p><img id="i-108499626518650d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/03/22/4746258-0-image-a-35_1538602959975.jpg" height="354" width="634" alt="An Amazon advert showing a tiny pony that helped spark a craze. Miniature Shetlands are just the latest in a long line of animals to be catastrophically overbred to satisfy human fads and fashions" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, the couple — and their team of volunteers — regularly work 16-hour days coaxing their teeny charges back to life, grooming them, taking their pulses every morning, dishing out medication and monitoring their health. The steeds are kept on short, thin grass, taught to forage again, encouraged to walk and graze together.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘They’re herd animals — they love to interact and make friends.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">At around midnight one evening in April 1949, a handsome middle-aged man alighted from a train at Rome’s central station. With no place to stay and just a handful of contacts, he would have been feeling extremely insecure and anxious.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But then this 47-year-old was accustomed to such feelings, because he had been on the run for the past four years — ever since the end of the war. For over three of those years he had hidden in huts and shacks high in the Austrian Alps, accompanied by a former private in the SS. They survived on whatever provisions his ever-loyal wife could haul up to him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With British and American troops scouring the valleys below, the man would have reflected on his previous life during the war, when he was Nazi governor of the Polish province of Galicia, a full general in the SS with the power of life and death over millions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it was a power that the aristocratic Baron Otto Gustav von Wächter had been more than happy to wield. During his two years running the province, an estimated 500,000 Jews were sent to their deaths, while hundreds, perhaps thousands more, were killed in reprisals. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a major war criminal, indicted for war crimes by the Polish government-in-exile as early as October 1942, it was hardly surprising that as soon as the war ended, Wächter — the name is pronounced ‘Vekkter’ — hotfooted it into the hills.</p><img id="i-fd9272d432ea30f8" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/04/07/4746892-6237467-The_twisting_tale_of_the_career_and_flight_of_Otto_von_W_chter_s-a-2_1538635468591.jpg" height="696" width="634" alt="The twisting tale of the career and flight of Otto von Wächter sounds like something that would make a superb film or a TV box set " class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">

<div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But on that night in Rome, the former Nazi bigwig was now just small fry, a piece of flotsam on the flood of humanity surging around a ravaged Europe. He had no friends, no power, and no idea of what the future held.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The twisting tale of the career and flight of Otto von Wächter sounds like something that would make a superb film or a TV box set. However, surprisingly perhaps, it is in fact the subject of a ten-part podcast produced by the BBC called Intrigue: The Ratline.</p><img id="i-ba6da929197cb2af" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/04/07/4746900-6237467-However_surprisingly_perhaps_it_is_in_fact_the_subject_of_a_ten_-m-3_1538635478838.jpg" height="397" width="306" alt="However, surprisingly perhaps, it is in fact the subject of a ten-part podcast produced by the BBC called Intrigue: The Ratline (Horst von Wachter - son of Nazi Otto von Wachter - at his 17th century Baroque castle Schloss Haggenburg)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">For those not up to speed with the bewildering number of ways in which one can access media these days, a podcast is typically a series of audio programmes that can be downloaded and then listened to on a PC, smartphone, laptop, tablet or iPod.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unlike a regular radio programme that has to be tuned into at a scheduled time, a podcast has the immense convenience of being available whenever you want it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Podcasts are now big business, partly due to the rise in those about crime, whether fictional, or — like The Ratline — historical.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The most popular such podcast has been a series called Serial, which started in 2014 and was about the murder in 1999 of an American schoolgirl called Hae Min Lee. It has been downloaded 208 million times — the type of listening figures that no radio station could ever hope to boast about.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s no doubt the BBC is hoping The Ratline will attract a similar number of downloads, and although it has not released any figures, it certainly looks like the podcast is going to be a hit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not only do the critics love it, with the doyenne of radio critics Gillian Reynolds calling it ‘an astounding piece of work, miles better than Serial’, but even the quickest of scans through social media sites reveals that people are lapping it up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But why is The Ratline proving so popular? The short answer is that the series has it all: Nazis, spies, the attics of German castles creaking with secrets, shady bishops, a love story, murders and other horrors — as well as an old man trying to make sense of his father’s legacy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That old man is Horst von Wächter, who ardently maintains that his father was a ‘good Nazi’, and was not responsible for the terrible crimes committed against the Jews and so many others when Otto was the governor of Galicia.</p><img id="i-8ed550af2018f183" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/04/07/4751492-6237467-image-m-5_1538635499501.jpg" height="672" width="634" alt="Otto Wächter (left) during meeting with Schutzstaffel leader, Heinrich Himmler" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trying to establish the truth is the podcast’s presenter, Philippe Sands, a highly respected barrister who specialises in international law and has appeared as a counsel and advocate in front of — among others — the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court in The Hague.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS news" data-version="2" id="mol-1fb29720-c7a1-11e8-89bc-6184503e242d">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Top 10 pulse-racing podcasts - and how to download them </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">First the good news — all podcasts are free to download.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>On an android tablet OR smartphone</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Visit Play Store.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Search for ‘podcasts’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Download and install ‘Google Podcasts’.

Take, for example, the letter von Wächter sent on August 29, 1942.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Things are going very slowly in the garden unfortunately,’ he wrote. ‘There’s not much labour around. The Jews are being deported in increasing numbers, and it’s hard to get hold of powder for the tennis court.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In just three brutally simple sentences, von Wächter encapsulated the essence of that phrase, made famous by philosopher Hannah Arendt after the Holocaust, ‘the banality of evil’. He worries about his garden as many people do, but then immediately switches to the ‘deportation’ of the Jews — a process that we today know all too well actually meant mass murder.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And then, most chillingly of all, the most notable thing he has to say about this destruction of human life is about how having fewer Jewish labourers will affect the upkeep of his tennis court.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sands slowly builds up a picture of von Wächter, charting his life from a privileged young man to one of the first Austrians to embrace Nazism in the early Twenties.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was his love of fascism that would see von Wächter twice become a fugitive. The first time was in 1934 in the wake of his participation in the killing of Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss in a failed Nazi coup attempt. The second time was in May 1945.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His political life is contrasted with his romantic endeavours. We see von Wächter fall in love with his future wife, Charlotte. We hear how she regarded him as ‘dashing and radiant and kind-hearted’, and how she ‘loved him and would have gone through fire for him’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is to Sands’s immense credit — as a man whose own family perished partly through the orders issued by von Wächter — that he presents his subject both as the committer of genocide as well as a loving family man with a wife and children. It is only when we see such murderers in the round that we can fully appreciate how even ‘normal’ people can commit abnormally vile acts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the war, Sands tracks von Wächter’s progress from Galicia to the Austrian Alps, and eventually to Rome, where he ends up consorting with the most diabolically shifty characters imaginable. Among them is the notorious Bishop Alois Hudal, the head of the Austrian-German congregation in Rome, who assisted many Nazis in their escapes.</p><img id="i-35e81dc21b3d8f07" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/04/07/4751476-6237467-image-m-8_1538635553119.jpg" height="540" width="634" alt="Otto Gustav Wächter, the SS leader and Nazi Governor of Galicia, pictured far left following Himmler (far right)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would certainly spoil the plot to reveal much more, and the number of surprises that Sands dishes up will doubtless make many listeners need to pause their iPods while they take it all in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As the author of a history about the largely ineffective hunt for Nazi war criminals, there is much about the podcast that to me rings absolutely true.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Sands does fall victim to the notion that there was a Nazi escape organisation called ‘the Ratline’ — indeed the podcast is named after it. In reality, however, there was no such thing, and neither was there a post-war Nazi plan for escape called the ‘Odessa’, or anything like it. In truth, the Nazis escaped by using various ad hoc networks that were maintained through informal word-of-mouth rather than through an official organisation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The idea, then, of a single entity such as the ‘Odessa’ or the ‘Ratline’ is the stuff of fiction.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When I interviewed the war criminal and former Gestapo officer Erich Priebke, who had successfully escaped to Argentina after the war, about whether such an organisation existed, he simply laughed and told me that he wished there had been, as he arrived in South America without a bean.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But none of this should detract from the thrilling tempo and the jaw-dropping revelations in Sands’s podcast, which sheds light on a largely forgotten and extremely dark period of history, complete with characters more evil than even the most lurid of box sets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Guy Walters is the author of Hunting Evil.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The White House, Republican senators, and the FBI were on the defense Wednesday as the bureau was on the verge of handing over rough interview summaries of its Brett Kavanaugh investigation having failed to interview accuser Christine Ford.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, blasted the bureau's failure to interview Ford even as Republicans said the bureau was set to hand over its investigative documents on Kavanaugh within hours.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The White House confirmation that it will not allow the FBI to interview Dr. Blasey Ford, Judge Kavanaugh or witnesses identified by Deborah Ramirez raises serious concerns that this is not a credible investigation and begs the question: What other restrictions has the White House placed on the FBI?' Feinstein said in a statement blasted out to the media.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her charge followed a <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-03/fbi-said-to-lack-white-house-approval-to-talk-to-kavanaugh-ford?srnd=premium">Bloomberg News</a> report that the FBI wasn't interviewing either the accused or the prominent accuser because it doesn't have the authority from the White House to do so.</p><img id="i-6dfcc81f4e814353" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/03/22/4715908-6237319-Why_hasn_t_she_been_asked_Christine_Blasey_Ford_s_attorneys_Debr-a-1_1538600600378.jpg" height="425" width="306" alt="Why hasn't she been asked: Christine Blasey Ford's attorneys Debra Katz and Michael Bromwich wrote to the FBI warning she had not been contacted at all" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-87618fecb7f6e74d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/03/22/4701748-6237319-image-a-2_1538600600487.jpg" height="425" width="306" alt="Brett Kavanaugh" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Asked Wednesday whether the White House had blocked interviews of Kavanaugh and Ford, counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway denied the White House had blocked the bureau from talking to Ford – but then also said the country had already heard from her 'for hours' – implying there might not be much to gain from a further interview.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘No. Absolutely... the whole country heard from her last week. The whole heard from her for hours under testimony,' Conway said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pressed on whether the FBI would be allowed to contact her, she dodged: ‘You’d have to talk to the FBI. But the FBI has been given free range … we’re not micromanaging anything,' Conway said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the parameters were up to the Senate when she was questioned Wednesday about the Bloomberg report. </p><img id="i-61fb774ba9947222" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/03/22/4746056-6237319-image-a-9_1538601490493.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="The FBI is preparing to hand over interview documents to Senators as early as Wednesday evening" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'As we've said several times, the president's indicated that whoever the FBI deems necessary to interview, he's fine with that. But he's also asked that the Senate be the ones that determine the scope of what they need in order to make a decision on whether they vote Kavanaugh up or down,' she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Sanders also said senators already had an 'opportunity' to question Ford and Kavanaugh.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I can also tell you that both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford were questioned in the most public way possible by the members of the Senate, who are ultimately the ones who have to make the determination on whether or not they vote for Judge Kavanaugh,' said Sanders. 'If they had additional questions for either one of them, they had a time and an opportunity, certainly, to ask those,' she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Feinstein told DailyMail.com Wednesday afternoon she did not know whether Ford would get interviewed. 'She should be,' she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Asked whether she was working with a Republican ally to ensure it, she scoffed: 'A Republican ally?  </p><img id="i-e60bf26ad6ecd023" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/03/22/4746054-6237319-image-a-10_1538601503155.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Kavanaugh refused during testimony to welcome a further FBI investigation, saying he would do what the Senate required" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We don’t really have a role in determining who the FBI interviews,' Feinstein said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Senior Judiciary Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch said he would have 'no objection' to Kavanaugh or Ford being interviewed, although he didn't appear to be pushing one way or the other.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I don’t know enough about it to be honest with you,' Hatch told Dailymail.com Wednesday evening. 'I do think we have enough there, but I would have no objection to a federal agent' conducting an interview,' he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The FBI is quickly wrapping up its investigation Kavanaugh – and will likely deliver its final product to senators Wednesday afternoon, a senior Republican senator said Wednesday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The bureau does not at this time plan to produce any overarching analysis or conclusions of what it finds following an interview process that began Friday after a dramatic compromise hatched in the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, GOP Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee said, they will simply turn over a stack of '302s,' the forms the bureau produces during background interviews.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Senators will then get the chance to review the materials in a secure facility, Corker told DailyMail.com and a contingent of reporters in the Capitol.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'These are 302s. And they’re just going to be a stack of those transmitted. That’s going to be it. There never has been expected to be findings,' Corker said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'What we think is going to happen they’re going to transmit a stack of 302s where they went and talked to people. And we’ll go through those. It’s possible that they have conflicting accounts, I hope that’s not the case.'</p><div class="item">

I think it’s likely to happen this afternoon.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">News of that the investigation is in its final hours comes as attorneys for Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford complain their client has not been contacted for an interview. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, they would contain rough summaries of information provided by the six or more people FBI agents have contacted, under a deal being closely monitored by the White House and GOP senators.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Such 302 documents contain an FBI agent's notes on information a witness provides. They don't contain analysis comparing the statements to what another witness may have said, or otherwise offer a conclusion – meaning if senators are looking for an answer on the key question of who is telling the truth, Kavanaugh or Ford, the documents very well may not provide it.</p><div>

Jeff Flake of Arizona, a key vote, were able to force the one-week probe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kavanaugh came back at last week's hearing with a defiant performance where he forcefully denied the charge and accused Democrats of a 'calculated and orchestrated political hit fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons, and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.' </p><div class="item">

Less than a decade later, in 2004, banks valued them at $900 million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump was able to bank a total of $413 million from his father's empire partly through those tax 'dodges.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the tender age of three, Trump was earning $200,000 a year in 2018 dollars from his dad's business empire, becoming a millionaire by age 8, according to the report.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By the time he graduated college – the Wharton School of Finance, as Trump likes to point out – he was getting $1 million a year in today's dollars – an amount that would jump to $5 million a year by the time he hit his 40s.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The transfers and undervaluations had the effect of allowing the Trump children to avoid potential gift taxes, and also estate taxes, based on the assets' full value.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Responded Trump lawyer Charles Harder: 'Should The Times state or imply that President Trump participated in fraud, tax evasion or any other crime, it will be exposing itself to substantial liability and damages for defamation.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harder distanced Trump and pointed the finger at lawyers and accountants.

Many decades ago the IRS reviewed and signed off on these transactions,' she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The New York Times' and other media outlets' credibility with the American people is at an all time low because they are consumed with attacking the president and his family 24/7 instead of reporting the news,' she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The truth is the market is at an all-time high, unemployment is at a fifty year low, taxes for families and businesses have been cut, wages are up, farmers and workers are empowered from better trade deals, and America's military is stronger than ever, yet the New York Times can rarely find anything positive about the President and his tremendous record of success to report. Perhaps another apology from the New York Times, like the one they had to issue after they got the 2016 election so embarrassingly wrong, is in order,' she concluded.</p><div>

The rich currently account for 34 percent of the U.S. population, and are on track to reach 40 percent by 2030 as more Americans experience upward mobility. The middle class account for 64 percent of the American population, though that group is projected to shrink to 58.5 percent in the next 12 years. The overall shift is driven by strong U.S. economic factors and low unemployment.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Valerie Bauman Social Affairs Reporter For Dailymail.com</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-03T22:37:20.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>EXCLUSIVE: A THIRD of the US population is rich, 64% is middle class</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-03T22:37:20.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6227745/A-new-global-majority-Half-world-middle-class-richer-study-finds.html" title="A new global majority: Half the world is now middle class or richer, study finds"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6231897/From-Jackson-Wyoming-Hailey-Idaho-Americas-unequal-metropolitan-areas-revealed.html" title="From Jackson, Wyoming to Hailey, Idaho: America’s most unequal metropolitan areas, revealed "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://file:///C:/Users/valerie.bauman/Downloads/cr18207.pdf" title="/C:/Users/valeri..."></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2018/09/27/a-global-tipping-point-half-the-world-is-now-middle-class-or-wealthier/?utm_campaign=Brookings%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=66298094" title="A global tipping point: Half the world is now middle class or wealthier"></link></item><item><title>Grandmother, 86, died after she was thrown from her seat on an Arriva bus into a metal pole 'when the driver braked harshly and rapidly to avoid crashing into a van in front'</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6236649/Grandmother-86-died-thrown-seat-Arriva-bus.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Oct 2018 19:38:20 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6236649</guid><description><![CDATA[Beatrice Meager, 86, was taken to hospital when it was discovered she had fact fractured several left ribs during the incident in Dartford, Kent, on the afternoon of September 19, 2016.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Emmerson's view of the van and its indicators was said to be 'clear and unobstructed'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But although the bus did not collide with the van, such was the alleged 'rapid nature' of his braking that a BMW following behind made 'slight contact' with the rear of the single decker.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the jury heard Mrs Meager was already on the bus floor by the time that collision occurred.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">CCTV on the bus captured the van indicating and the time delay before Emmerson began braking.

She was helped up by another passenger and by Mr Emmerson who swiftly came to assist,' said the prosecutor.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'However, she had in fact sustained fractures to her left ribs which led to breathing difficulties, infections and other complications from which she later died.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Emmerson told police at the scene that having looked in his mirror and then checked whether there were any waiting passengers at a bus stop, he looked back at the road ahead to see the van had 'slammed its brakes on'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He added he then took evasive action by applying his brakes 'as hard as he could', the court heard.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He said that in the moments before the incident he checked his nearside mirror to see if there was any traffic behind him,' said Mr Yale.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When he looked back ahead he saw the van driver brake sharply.

'The lady in front of me got up to see to her and the driver got out of his cab to help.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He said something about 'He didn't indicate'.

She said she didn't want the ambulance but I think someone had called one anyway. She then said she felt a bit dizzy,' added Mrs Myers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Van driver Mr Pickthorn was returning to work from his break. He told the jury he was aware of speed cameras in the area and was driving at no more than 30mph along Hawley Road.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As he approached his turning he indicated and slowed down to a crawl or 'roll' while waiting for an oncoming car.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said the vehicle had just passed him when he heard either the screech of tyres or a bang, looked in his side mirror and saw the bus driver put his hands to his face.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Pickthorn said he then noticed the car behind the bus but because his van had not been hit, he continued to turn into the alleyway.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He did not know there had been an incident until police spoke to him later that day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It wasn't until the old lady died that I was thinking about everything I did and whether I did anything wrong,' he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Mr Pickthorn maintained he did not brake hard and had no need to. He also denied he went to turn into the entrance ahead of the oncoming car and then changed his mind.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Because it's such a straight road you can see what is coming.
