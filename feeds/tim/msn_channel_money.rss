So if the advice turns out to be wrong, customers can seek recourse through the Financial Ombudsman Service. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The bank says the algorithm will also point to other options if it identifies that investing isn’t currently right for the user free of charge. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It claims a customer without any emergency savings may be directed to a savings account while one with outstanding debt would be advised to repay that first.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">How much does it cost?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">As mentioned earlier, the first cost is £20 for the personal recommendation but you'll also have to contend with a 0.35 per cent platform fee - charged every six months depending on the investment balance - as well as ongoing investment charges.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These scale up from 0.34 per cent for the Santander Multi Index Fund 1 to 0.49 per cent for the Santander Multi Index Fund 4.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Put simply, users face investment charges (including the platform fee) of up to 0.84 per cent - or 8p for every £100 invested. </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">How does it compare?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like Santander's robo proposition, rival NatWest's offering gives fully regulated financial advice but does not charge for the advice unless customers decide to invest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the user chooses to do so, the service levies £10 plus fees for the investment - which are capped at 0.6 per cent a year. So Santander's proposition is more expensive. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">NatWest's service is essentially an add-on to the bank's pre-existing NatWest Invest online service that offers a range of five funds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nutmeg, arguably the best known online wealth manager, provides simplified investment advice by offering a solution based on the user's responses to an obligatory questionnaire at the beginning of the application process. </p><img id="i-5bce2e337e17aee1" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/09/28/14/50C6416700000578-6218079-image-a-3_1538142504096.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Not all services have been successful with UBS announcing in August it was closing its SmartWealth robo proposition for those with £15,000 or more to invest" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It offers 15 different risk rated portfolios - of which 10 are designed and fully managed by its in-house investment team. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The remaining five are packaged portfolios crafted by their investment team but with no ongoing strategic intervention. These fall within Nutmeg's fixed allocation proposition.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The minimum investment is £500 with £100 monthly contributions. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It costs more than Santander's automated advice service.

That matters to us, as we have a tracker mortgage, but the rise was heavily cushioned by the savings balance set against it.</p><div>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Britain's army of 37 million car and van drivers face the grim prospect of surging petrol and diesel prices at the pumps. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Global prices for crude have hit the highest level in four years – rising above $85 a barrel at one point – driven higher by American sanctions on oil-producing giant Iran. With motorists already suffering, any plans that Chancellor Philip Hammond had of raising fuel duty are now dead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, Theresa May chose to make the extension of the nine-year freeze on fuel duty a centrepiece of her Birmingham conference speech.</p><img id="i-b5c77994853f9f28" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/03/22/4743958-6236899-Price_increase_Global_prices_for_petrol_and_diesel_are_at_their_-a-14_1538600456114.jpg" height="436" width="634" alt="Price increase: Global prices for petrol and diesel are at their highest level in four years" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Prime Minister's decision was enthusiastically welcomed by the Fair Fuel Campaign which lauded May for 'seeing common sense' and overruling the Treasury, which will have to look elsewhere to help fund the £20 billion extra the Tories are promising the NHS for its 70th birthday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Drivers in the UK are among the most heavily taxed in the world, and face some of the highest fuel duties, in spite of a Tory freeze. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Around 61 per cent of the cost of a litre of petrol on the nation's forecourts already ends up with the Exchequer. Fuel duty alone, of 57.95p a litre, raises £28 billion a year.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unfortunately, the forecasters have wrongly dismissed the power of oil exporters to manipulate prices and hit us in the pocket.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In early 2017, an unholy alliance of Saudi Arabia and Russia was faced with falling income from oil exports. To combat the threat to their prosperity they brought in radical production cuts. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The law of supply and demand applied: the less oil that was pumped, the higher the price rose as it became a more precious commodity. That contributed to a jump in price from just $27 a barrel at its low point in 2016 to above $80 a barrel. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The price of Brent crude is on course for its fifth consecutive quarterly increase, the longest such period of rising prices since 2007, when it peaked at $147.50.</p><img id="i-3b330a356185c18f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/03/22/4744174-6236899-Cap_on_costs_Prime_Minister_has_announced_an_extension_to_her_ni-a-13_1538600456112.jpg" height="427" width="634" alt="Cap on costs: Prime Minister has announced an extension to her nine-year freeze on fuel duty" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The recent jump is provoking concern on both sides of the Atlantic, with President Trump appealing to Russia and Opec to expand production. The last thing he needs in the run-up to mid-term elections in November is a backlash from motorists.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Reuters reported yesterday that Trump's 'friends' in Saudi Arabia are listening and have agreed to raise production but so far there has been minimal impact.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump bears some responsibility. His decision to isolate Iran over its spread of terror has made other nations nervous about dealing with Tehran. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The slowdown in Iranian production is occurring even though the United Nations ruled Trump's sanctions illegal. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another factor hurting British drivers is the slide in value of the pound to $1.30. Oil is denominated in dollars, which means every fall in the value of the pound pushes up market prices and the cost to consumers.</p><img id="i-f3a49d1ffc2d3fef" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/03/22/4744320-6236899-Asda_and_Tesco_sell_fuel_for_less_than_at_Esso_and_Shell_garages-a-15_1538600456123.jpg" height="361" width="634" alt="Asda and Tesco sell fuel for  less than at Esso and Shell garages and are first to lower prices" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The drop in the pound in recent months is largely attributable to the political uncertainty engendered by Brexit negotiations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Motorists are also impacted by a 'rocket and feather' approach, where the cost of petrol and diesel rises like a rocket immediately when the price of oil increases but when it declines, they see little benefit as prices fall like a feather – an affront to every driver.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The steep rise dates back to last May, when it jumped 6p a litre, the most since motoring organisation RAC began monitoring 18 years ago. The price has gone up a further 3p a litre in the last month or so.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The RAC blames a 'punitive combination' of higher crude oil prices and a weakened pound. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The best hope for many drivers is that there's a local Asda or Tesco selling fuel. They charge much less than Esso and Shell garages and are often the first to lower prices, to tempt people to visit their food stores.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anyone unfortunate to need to fill up on the motorway faces the highest prices of all – an average premium of nearly 20p a litre.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the most puzzling aspects of the price rise is that no one saw it coming. Last year, so-called experts began to believe prices, in the $30 to $40 range, were with us for ever.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In this era of fewer garages and less choice, there is a palpable public anger over exploitation. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Higher prices have a damaging effect on just about every driver and company because climbing fuel costs act like a tax on the whole economy. They raise consumer prices, which in turn risks higher interest rates and potentially threatens recession.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">May, sensibly, has announced the fuel duty hike is off the agenda. Failure to have extended the freeze would have been an act of contempt towards every motorist in the country.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Global prices for crude have hit the highest level in four years – rising above $85 a barrel at one point – driven higher by American sanctions on oil-producing giant Iran.

A precedent was set when US broadcaster Comcast coughed up a massive £30bn for Sky but ITV did not take the bait.  Just last month, chief executive Carolyn McCall said ITV would not grow just for growth's sake but would instead ensure shareholder returns by being 'incredibly disciplined' about acquisitions.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Lucy White For The Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-03T22:25:41.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>MARKET REPORT: ITV shares up by 3.8% as it says it won't buy Endemol</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-03T22:25:41.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-6207003/Predators-circle-UK-blue-chips-merger-mania-grips-City.html" title="Predators circle UK blue chips as merger mania grips the City: ITV, Burberry and TalkTalk tipped as targets"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/mortgageshome/article-6232649/Hidden-catch-Help-Buy-Homeowners-face-mass-red-tape-remortgage.html" title="The hidden catches of Help to Buy: As the first five-year deals come to an end, homeowners face a mass of red tape to remortgage"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/experts/article-6221791/TONY-HETHERINGTON-Watchdog-turn-TV-care-firm-scammed-252-mother.html" title="TONY HETHERINGTON: Watchdog must turn off this 'TV care' firm that scammed £252 from my mother"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-6222413/Revenues-fall-fifth-29-7m-TV-comedies-firm-Hat-Trick-Productions.html" title="Revenues fall by a fifth to £29.7m at TV comedies firm Hat Trick Productions but owner says falls and jumps are 'nature of the business'"></link></item><item><title>Tesco steps up its fight with Aldi and Lidl as boss Dave Lewis reports his radical revamp is close to completion</title><link>http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-6236867/Tesco-steps-fight-Aldi-Lidl-boss-reports-radical-revamp-close-completion.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Oct 2018 20:55:51 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6236867</guid><description><![CDATA[Reporting the best sales figures for a decade, the 53-year-old said he is close to completing a total revamp of the budget food range as he takes on the German discounters.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Under the leadership of Sir Terry Leahy, Tesco had a reputation for thinking ahead of the crowd. It was first into out-of-town superstores, first into convenience stores, first into eastern Europe, first online, and so on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then came the accounting scandal, the disgrace of former chief executive Phil Clarke et al, and a loss of mojo.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Former Unilever executive Dave Lewis has spent much of the last few years repairing the damage and rediscovering the power of doing things differently. </p><img id="i-c8b8ee11ca3bad24" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/03/20/4742642-6236865-image-a-9_1538594909075.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Tesco CEO Dave Lewis poses for a photograph inside a Jack's store during its launch in Chatteris, near Cambridge" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lewis lucked out with Booker running rings around a soft-touch Competition and Markets Authority and benefiting from the collapse of tobacco wholesaler Palmer &amp; Harvey. Indeed, it was Booker leniency which encouraged Sainsbury's and Asda to unfurl a merger which would make the combined group Britain's biggest grocer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, Lewis continues to innovate, with Jack's seeking to be the British version of Aldi and Lidl as own-brands make a big comeback in stores. Going down this route makes a great deal of sense. With margins under pressure because of everyday price wars, own-brand merchandise allows grocers to control factories, improve the supply chain and be more in charge of profits. </p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unfortunately for Lewis and shareholders there is still a bit of legacy to deal with. Leahy had the grand ambition to broaden Tesco's reach overseas so that 50 per cent of turnover was generated abroad. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That came unstuck with Fresh and Easy in the American West which gobbled up capital. One of his early moves after taking the helm was to pay down some of the debt accumulated partly as a result of overseas ventures, which meant selling the profitable Korean operation. The difficulty with abroad is that it is hard for overseas retailers to have much traction with the host nation.</p><img id="i-bd3bead4bb43460a" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/03/20/4742656-6236865-image-m-10_1538594914327.jpg" height="361" width="634" alt="Alex Brummer says no one quite knows how Tesco's other overseas commitment, a supply deal with French behemoth Carrefour, is going to work out" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">In the last six months Tesco has had local difficulty as Poland restored Sunday as the Sabbath, forcing shops to close.

Failing to meet a profits forecast is a big sin in the City so Tesco shares took a drubbing in spite of encouraging like-for-likes and an underlying profit of £933 million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Putting this to one side, it is worth noting that a time when some analysts are delighting in writing off the high street Tesco demonstrates how, with rigorous and imaginative management, grocery retail is alive and kicking.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sinking feeling</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Getting the price of initial public offerings right is always tricky.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">It wasn't all plain sailing however. The supermarket's statutory operating profit fell 6.5 per cent  as it booked exceptional costs linked to the closure of its non-food online business Tesco Direct. And its sales in Central Europe and Asia remain under pressure. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What's more, there's a proposed mega-merger between Sainsbury's and Asda on the horizon, which will only serve to ramp up the already heated competitive environment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, points out, while the discounters continue to pile on the pressure, 'Amazon also casts its own long shadow'.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Commenting on the results, he said: 'Since elephants do not gallop, Tesco can be pleased with its ongoing and measured progress.'</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There are any number of incremental improvements within this statement, showing that the supermarket behemoth continues, for the most part, to fend off its competition.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">We've known about spoof texts and calls for years - yet we don't seem to be any further along when it comes to blocking them. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And why haven't banks just introduced a blanket ban on including telephone numbers in text messages so there is no confusion among customers as to whether they should trust them?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If we are to have a chance at winning the war on fraud, we need every industry involved - banks, telecoms companies, regulators and the Government.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last week, a new code of conduct was proposed to help prevent customers from transferring their money to fraudsters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was a major step forward, with banks promising to introduce new alerts that warn the customers they believe may be at risk. But a huge amount still needs to be done.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the meantime, victims should not be left out of pocket when they've done nothing wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Banks agree as much - but they refuse to foot the bill.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And while they dilly-dally about thinking up other ways to fund a compensation scheme, it's the victims who continue to pay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On Monday, the City watchdog fined Tesco Bank £16.4 million over a cyber attack that allowed criminals to steal millions of pounds from its customers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If similar sanctions were imposed on banks for letting criminals open accounts or failing to act swiftly enough when customers report fraud, you can bet your life they'd take action in no time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's clear that banks cannot win the fight against fraud on their own - but we'll be watching closely to ensure they are not let off the hook.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>A mutual friend?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What'S going on at Nationwide? Since July, Britain's biggest building society has revealed plans to scale back telephone banking, scrapped a vital paper statement sent to seven million savers and - as we expose <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/news/article-6233137/.html">today</a> - is now hiking the cost of spending abroad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a mutual, Nationwide is supposed to be driven by the desire to put its members first.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, while the building society might chant the mantra 'on your side', the only thinking behind these changes is to boost its own bottom line.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As one Money Mail reader put it this week, these steps have put Nationwide 'on the road to becoming just another hard-nosed banking business'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He added that since Joe Garner took over as chief executive in 2016, 'there has been a gradual slide towards being just another bank on pay and perks for CEOs and deteriorating customers' returns'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it's true. The building society dished out £6.5 million to its bosses last year. Mr Garner alone took home £2.3 million. Meanwhile, its customers are losing out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nationwide claims that its goal is to become a 'national treasure', akin to the NHS and the National Trust.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If that's the case, it needs to start looking after its reputation as an exemplar of good practice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Because, as many once-loved banks can testify, when trust is gone, it is very hard to win back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My budget wish</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This year's Budget has been set for Monday, October 29.

They might know a rogue employee there or get their hands on stolen personal details leaked after cyberhacks. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Criminals often trade this type of information on the so-called ‘dark web’. They might get hold of a bank statement if you fail to update your address or your post falls into the wrong hands.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other conmen make phone calls posing as other legitimate firms you deal with and trick you into revealing who you bank with.</p><img id="i-4d6154ed20670d7" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/03/09/50EA6E2300000578-6232871-Rod_Owens_lost_thousands_of_pounds_to_scammers_who_pretended_to_-a-4_1538555911670.jpg" height="519" width="306" alt="Rod Owens lost thousands of pounds to scammers who pretended to be his bank, Santander" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once they know your bank it is just a matter of using software freely available on the internet to mask their phone number behind another of their choosing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They can then make calls where the number that displays on your screen is that of your bank. They can also use online technology to change the way text messages are labelled so they appear to come from a particular organisation, such as your bank.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your phone will then display the name of that company at the top of the texts and group it with others you’ve had from that firm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rod, 49, was at the supermarket when he’d received the message warning he may be a victim of fraud. He dashed home to call his bank back as requested.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A well-spoken lady answered and went through security questions. She told him she would send a series of codes which he should read out. It wasn’t until two days later that he discovered he had been duped.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fraudsters had taken control of his account and the numbers he’d read out were one-time passcodes to authorise payments from his account. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Handing them over meant the crooks had been able to empty his account of £9,204. They had taken the £7,704 he’d saved to pay his tax bill and left him £1,500 overdrawn.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Santander had attempted to contact Rod but the fraudsters had managed to block his mobile phone from receiving calls. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Santander agreed to write off the overdraft but refused to pay back the £7,704 because he had unwittingly authorised the payments by handing over the codes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rod, an electrician from Coventry, says: ‘I’ve always been able to spot scam emails. If the text hadn’t looked so official I wouldn’t have thought twice about calling the number given. It should be much more secure between banks and phone companies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘When I found out, I was panic-stricken and had to borrow money from my mum to pay the taxman.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman for Santander says: ‘We are sympathetic to Mr Owens. Unfortunately, despite clear warnings not to, he gave away confidential security details including one-time passcodes which enabled the fraudsters to access his account.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Financial Ombudsman Service ruled in the bank’s favour.</p><img id="i-aedfe365665f0f5d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/02/20/4711986-6232871-image-a-14_1538510362430.jpg" height="438" width="634" alt="Santander tried to contact Rod when they found out he had been a victim of fraud but the scammers blocked their calls coming through. They agreed to pay back some of his money " class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">NEVER CALL PHONE NUMBERS IN TEXTS</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the reasons people are being caught out is that there is no consistency over what information banks include in text messages. Fraud experts say people should never ring back a number in a text claiming to be from their bank in case it has been sent by a fraudster.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They should instead use the number on the back of their card or the bank’s website.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet despite this, some banks continue to include telephone numbers in text messages.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lloyds Banking Group — which includes Halifax and Bank of Scotland — and Barclays, for example, both include their phone numbers in texts to ‘make it easier’ for customers to contact them. Royal Bank of Scotland — which includes NatWest — and Santander include phone numbers in some of their texts, but TSB does not.</p><img id="i-479100e5949a7395" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/02/20/4711910-6232871-image-a-8_1538510123164.jpg" height="426" width="634" alt="Jim King and his wife, Anna, almost lost thousands of pounds after being tricked by scammers" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Scott McGready, fraud expert and part of the national Cyber Security Tactical Advice team which aids law enforcement, says: ‘Spoof calls and texts are a major enabler of fraud. Banks need to be more streamlined. They should just all agree never to put telephone numbers in texts so there is no confusion.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anna King, 62, and her husband Jim, 66, from Warlingham, Surrey, lost nearly £13,000 last November after calling back numbers in text messages claiming to be from their bank. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The couple had each received messages they thought were genuine because they appeared in the same chain as previous NatWest texts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But when they called the numbers given they were tricked into handing over vital security details. These enabled criminals to make payments totalling £12,857 from their account.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">NatWest blocked a further transfer for £7,800 but would not refund the money already taken because the couple had handed over details which enabled the payments.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anna, a counsellor, says: ‘The messages were in exactly the same format as the ones from NatWest and there was no way I could tell the difference. I can’t believe the phone companies and banks allow this to happen.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jim, who runs a building services firm, says: ‘I’ve worked non-stop since the age of 16 to put money aside and these thieves just take the cash in a matter of hours.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A NatWest spokesman says: ‘We take our responsibilities for preventing scams very seriously. We would remind customers to remain vigilant against any type of scam and they should never make a payment or divulge full security credentials, including card reader codes, at the request of someone over the phone purporting to be from their bank.’</p><img id="i-a386a108a244c3c0" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/02/20/4711938-6232871-image-a-10_1538510251517.jpg" height="397" width="634" alt="Con: Jim didn't question if the text was genuine as it was in the same format as previous texts " class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">WHEN YOU CAN’T TRUST CALLER ID</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Richard Emery, of fraud consultancy 4Keys International, says: ‘Banks should not send phone numbers in texts but should instead instruct customers to contact them using the number on the back of their card.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Regulators and phone companies also need to take urgent action to stop fraudsters spoofing phone numbers when they call as well.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jean Perry, 88, had no idea crooks were able change their number to make it look as though they were calling from a legitimate firm — a mistake that cost her £20,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She took a call last December from a man purporting to be from a Barclays fraud team who said crooks had tried to steal £2,000 from her account.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Michael’ was so well-spoken, Jean says. Her son Julian, 59, also spoke to the man and believed he was genuine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jean, whose late husband worked for Barclays for 40 years, asked the man to prove he was who he said he was. </p><img id="i-1b414b37f3fd5508" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/02/21/4712382-6232871-image-a-17_1538510885156.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Con artists can disguise themselves as bank staff to persuade people to hand over money" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He told her to hang up and said he would call her back using the number on the back of her card. When he did, the Barclays customer services number flashed up on her phone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Hindsight’s a wonderful thing. I should have put down the phone and called back Barclays myself,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He seemed to know everything about my accounts, mobile phone number and so on.

So, if the value of the property rose, the buyer would have to pay back more than the sum they borrowed — but if it dropped, they would pay back less. </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, as the interest-free period comes to an end for the first 14,000 borrowers, they face a host of hidden problems.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When they signed up to the scheme, house prices were forecast to rise. This was supposed to help buyers build up equity they could then use to pay off their debt to the Government.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the market has been stagnant in many areas and not everyone has seen the value of their home go up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, as the first wave of five-year government loans comes to an end, some borrowers instead face the prospect of remortgaging without repaying any of the debt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Homeowners who cannot yet repay their government loan face interest set at 1.75 per cent. On a £40,000 debt, this would equate to £700 a year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These homeowners also face a limited choice, because only around 40 out of the 316 Help To Buy deals on the market allow borrowers to remortgage without paying off any of their equity loan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">James Chidgey, new homes and Help To Buy manager at the Mortgage Advice Bureau, says: 'Mortgage lenders would rather you pay off the loan in full.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's not fair on borrowers that so many mortgage lenders want to help them buy a home, but will not help with their remortgaging options.'</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-369d5520-c728-11e8-a0c5-ad0cd95c9169">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">What you need to  know about Help to Buy</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Help to Buy is hugely controversial but it has also done what it says on the tin by helping a lot of people to buy homes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, is borrowing 20 per cent interest-free for five years to buy a new-build home a decent deal as a buyer?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What are the things you need to consider before signing up?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And why is it considered a bad economic move? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Find out that and more on this special excerpt from the This is Money podcast.</p><div class="mol-html" id="mol-ba9709c0-c728-11e8-a0c5-ad0cd95c9169">                            <div><iframe width="100%" height="300" style="background-color:transparent; display:block; padding: 0; max-width:700px;" src="//embeds.audioboom.com/posts/7031429-what-exactly-is-help-to-buy-podcast-cut/embed/v4?eid=AQAAAFnUtFuFSmsA" title="Audioboom player"></iframe>            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> Press play above or listen (and please subscribe if you like the podcast) at <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/this-is-money-show/id979600898?mt=2">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.acast.com/thisismoneyshow">Acast</a>, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0JQrDHMhoyC3Bu1Dnnkyc8">Spotify</a> and <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://audioboom.com/channel/thisismoney">Audioboom</a> or visit our <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/podcast/index.html">This is Money Podcast page</a>.  </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Experts say that even those who are able to repay their loan in part or full also face expensive fees and limited deals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you can repay the loan in full, you will first need to instruct an independent valuer to work out what your property is worth. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is so Homes England can work out the current value of the stake that it holds in your home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> You must then send Homes England this figure, along with your mortgage and solicitor details, as well as a cheque for a £200 admin fee.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Homes England will then calculate how much you owe the Government and provide your solicitor with a final settlement figure. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is supposed to be done within seven to 14 days — but Daniel Bailey, managing director of the mortgage broker Middleton Finance, says the process can often take as long as six months and cost five times as much as a standard remortgage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Bailey says: 'A straightforward remortgage often comes with a free valuation and money towards solicitor fees.

  </div>
</div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The likes of British American Tobacco (BAT), Philip Morris International, another tobacco company, and gambling firms Ladbrokes, William Hill and Paddy Power are lurking in most successful funds. Kicking out tobacco would mean knocking most income funds on the head.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I did very well in the early 2000s with Invesco Perpetual Income, then managed by Neil Woodford, but I have already sold these and Woodford's current income fund.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those still sucked in by tobacco should note the outlook isn't good as vaping steals the market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Traditionally, ethical investing meant a small world of funds with erratic performance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the ethically based FTSE4Good Index, with a 137 per cent return over ten years, has almost matched the FTSE All Share.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The U.S. FTSE4Good has returned 353 per cent over ten years, compared with 323 pc for the S&amp;P 500 Index.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I can see little argument for excluding all oil or mining firms. Most of us drive, we need to heat our homes and Mrs H is partial to the odd gemstone. Others would disagree.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I would prefer my investments targeted towards companies with good employment practices and environmental records, though.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Adrian Lowcock, Willis Owen's head of personal investing, ran me through some approaches.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can screen out companies that are seen as unethical or not environmentally friendly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There's responsible or sustainable investing, which looks at environmental, social and governance factors (so-called ESG). This looks at how companies behave.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there is impact investing, which means positive screening for firms you feel are doing the right things.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, how difficult is it now to invest ethically? Well, Royal London runs a UK FTSE4Good fund. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it is expensive for a tracker, with a 1.5 per cent annual charge — and it's not readily available on most investment platforms. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Performance is also quite weak over five years, at 33.6 per cent growth. But it was better over ten years, at 101.4 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Legal &amp; General Ethical takes the 350 biggest UK companies, then excludes those involved in water pollution, intensive farming, gambling, pornography, weapons manufacturing or tobacco sales.</p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">It charges 0.69 per cent — or less on some platforms. Over five years, it has returned 38.1 per cent and, over ten years, 151.9 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To compare, L&amp;G's normal UK Index fund can boast 39.8 per cent over five years and 130 per cent over ten.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">BlackRock offers iShares — basically funds that trade on a stock exchange — which track ethical and sustainable indices.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One firm that's put considerable effort into checking out environmental, social and governance factors is Hermes Investment Management. Lewis Grant, global equities senior portfolio manager, says: 'We believe our responsibilities as investors do not stop with a decision to buy or sell a stock.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We must act as engaged owners of the companies in which we are invested and the assets that we manage. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This means engaging in constructive dialogue and taking action through our ownership rights.' Its Impact Opportunities fund is up 14 per cent since launching last December.</p><img id="i-477653656bd1219f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/02/20/4711952-6232949-image-a-14_1538510348838.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The evil weed: But kicking out tobacco would mean knocking most income funds on the head" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Lowcock mentions two funds. For the cautious, Kames Ethical Cautious Managed applies a strict ethical filter that excludes mining and energy stocks, tobacco and banks with investment operations. </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The fund tends to have a bias towards mid and smaller companies, as well as favouring cyclical stocks,' he says. Returns reflect the caution — with 30.3 per cent over five years, but 116 per cent over ten.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For a global view, Stewart Investors Worldwide Sustainability Fund will, says Mr Lowcock, 'take account of sustainability themes and issues and requires positive engagement with companies in respect of these'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has returned 78 per cent in five years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Foreign &amp; Colonial runs a range called Responsible funds. Its Responsible Global Equity has roughly doubled investors' money in five years. The average global unit trust has returned 65 per cent over five years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, where does this leave me? Like many, I would love to invest more ethically. But I still feel there is a lack of choice. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From now on, I plan to avoid putting new money into funds that are heavily investing in tobacco or gambling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the fundamental question for the investment industry, whether they be running actively managed funds or trackers, is this: why do you make it so damned hard for us to be good?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">t.hazell@dailymail.co.uk</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Ethics is a difficult concept in the world of business.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Under pressure from activist investor Elliott, the mining group BHP Billiton also is being encouraged to leave the FTSE 100 and adopt a single quote in Australia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Much of BHP’s business is in Asia-Pacific. But Elliott ignores the fact that London is the preferred home for natural resources companies. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These include Rio Tinto, Glencore, Anglo American, Randgold and others traversing the globe. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A City presence means deeper analytical capacity, greater access to fund-raising and deal-making and an ability for fund managers to compare, contrast and switch holdings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Consultants FTI estimated a £16.9billion potential uplift in value if a single listing were to be created for BHP. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the company believes the expense and risks of overhauling the current structure far outweigh the benefits. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Moreover, a behemoth of BHP’s size would overwhelm the key Aussie index, making up to 15 per cent of the market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With so much value in one stock it would hardly make the Aussie index very attractive to investors desiring to diversify risk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are doubtless other actions that BHP could take to realise more value for investors. But unification of the quotation on the ASX in Sydney makes no more sense than Unilever washing its hands of the FTSE 100.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">BHP’s board is right to hold the line and reject Elliott’s entreaties.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Last post</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The £1.2billion hit to the Royal Mail share price since it revealed a nasty profits warning late on Monday is shocking.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All of the reasons behind that warning point to management bungling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The slump in marketing mailings as a result of the new EU data storage rules, GDPR, should have been predictable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Equally perplexing is the scrapping of targets for £230m of cost savings this year. All of this puts the Royal Mail’s status as a FTSE 100 company in danger.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The retreat in the Royal Mail’s fortunes also demonstrates one of the risks in John McDonnell’s proposal to hand over 10pc of the shares in UK-owned companies with more than 250 workers to employees.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The posties were given 10pc of Royal Mail stock on privatisation in 2013 and have lost a fortune in a matter of days.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Contrast the poor fortunes of the postal workers with those of Royal Mail bosses. Moya Greene sailed off into the sunset in June with a golden goodbye of £1million and other awards, which could bring her total pay up to £2.3million. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her departure was rapidly followed by the choice of Rico Back as chief executive, with a golden hello of £6million. This led to one of the biggest shareholder revolts in corporate history followed by the resignation of chairman Peter Long.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the very least pay committee chair Orna Ni-Chionna ought to look at a clawback of unjustified payments to Greene and Back. If that is too hard then she should do the honourable thing and return to sender.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Living better</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Amazon has thrown down the gauntlet to other UK employers by lifting the minimum wage for all its workforce, including temporary and seasonal employees.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In London it zips up to £10.50-an-hour – outjumping the £10.20 of the Living Wage Foundation and the £8.75 National Living Wage in London – a legacy of George Osborne. Outside the capital Amazon is pledging £9.50 an hour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Critics will say Amazon can afford to be generous because it pays minimal corporation tax and wins from lower business rates because it operates from warehouse space rather than the High Street.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe. But it will mean more spending power for Amazon workers and could begin the process of restoring squeezed household incomes.

Available from banks and building societies, these accounts typically run for a year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The two main things you need to know are whether you can touch the money during the 12-month savings period and what happens to your cash afterwards.</p><div>

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">With most regular savings accounts, you need to move your money at the end of the term. If you don’t, most will dump your cash into an easy-access account paying virtually no interest. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some will let you take money out during the year, but carry on saving, earning the top rate. Others will only give you access if you close the account and cut your interest rate to a pittance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To get a rough idea of how much to expect at the end, tot up the amount you hope to save. Then divide the interest rate by two and apply this figure to your total yearly savings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With Virgin Money Regular Saver, you earn a fixed rate of 3 per cent on between £1 and £250 a month. You can take money out at any time. If you save £100 each month for the year, you’ll end up with around £1,218.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Saffron Building Society’s Regular Saver is similar, but has a higher rate of 3.5 per cent on up to £200 a month. If you save £100 a month, you’ll build up £1,222, including £22 interest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You may find your current account provider gives a better rate of return.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">First Direct’s Regular Saver, available to its 1st Account holders, pays 5 per cent fixed on savings of between £25 and £300 a month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you save the maximum £300 a month for a year, you’ll end up with £3,697, including £97 interest. Save £100 a month and you’ll have £1,232, including £32 interest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can’t take money out during the year. And if you close the account, your interest rate will drop to 0.15 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">M&amp;S Bank offers a similar deal, also paying 5 per cent, but only on up to £250 a month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">HSBC — which owns both First Direct and M&amp;S Bank — also offers the scheme, but pays either 3 per cent or 5 per cent, depending on which of its current accounts you have.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Halifax’s Regular Saver, paying a fixed 2.5 per cent, is open to all savers, rather than just its current account customers. You can’t make withdrawals during the year, but you can close the account.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some banks and building societies offer variable rate accounts, which means the rate can change at any time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At Kent Reliance, the rate is currently 3 per cent, Yorkshire BS 2.5 per cent and Leeds BS 2.3 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">sy.morris@dailymail.co.uk</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>As a rule of thumb, you should have three to six months’ worth of income put aside, in case you lose your job or face an unexpected large bill.

mortgage? </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Homeowners who took interest-only mortgages in the 1990s and  2000s and have since retired, or approaching retirement, have had a tough time of late.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unlike with a repayment mortgage, the debt on an interest-only homeloan is not paid down. This makes monthly payments much cheaper but means that when the term is up, owners must find the sum needed to clear the mortgage debt. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some homeowners will have problems in repaying their debt, as endowment plans fell flat, but many who borrowed through the 2000s did not have investment or savings plans to eventually clear their mortgage balance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The must either find the money or keep their mortgage going. However, the 2008 financial crash and consequent tightening of mortgage lending rules has left thousands unable to remortgage - despite the fact they continue to meet their monthly repayments on time and in full. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why? Firstly, because of something called 'affordability'. In April 2014 the financial watchdog brought in rules that meant lenders had to be able to show evidence that borrowers could afford to repay their mortgages. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While not banned, the new rules resulted in lenders running scared of interest-only mortgages, often stress testing borrowers against the cost of not just their interest-only payments but also the cost of a repayment mortgage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Secondly, they must also check that the customer has a credible repayment strategy in place. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The combination of these two things has been to restrict interest-only lending to low loan-to-value mortgages and high earners. </p><img id="i-f869749138131c29" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/08/11/4EECF57D00000578-6034625-image-a-2_1533723414337.jpg" height="472" width="634" alt="Compound interest can eat into your home's equity significantly - leaving little left at the end " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">For years there has been no option for retired borrowers who don't have the luxury of a guaranteed pension or annuity income to remortgage onto a 'normal' loan. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, they've been funnelled towards equity release - a lifetime mortgage that allows you to roll up interest into the loan, make no monthly repayments and repay the full debt on the sale of the property. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is a far more expensive option. For example, over a 20-year period a £30,000 equity release loan can compound into a loan worth £79,447 - add 10 years to that, and the loan would be worth £129,288.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite the strings attached, the equity release market is booming - homeowners aged 55 and over unlocked a record £971million from their homes in the second quarter of the year alone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Carrying on with their existing interest-only mortgage has been the alternative to this route, but many homeowners in this position are now on their lender's standard variable rate - and these rates are  rising in line with the Bank of England's base rate, making monthly repayments more expensive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Older homeowners have found themselves faced with a series of unpalatable choices as a result of taking a perfectly legal mortgage 10 years ago or more.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">The rules on retirement lending changed this year </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rise of retirement interest-only has come after the financial watchdog created this new mortgage category earlier this year, to encourage banks and building societies to create deals that could suit those struggling with their mortgages.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It stated that with retirement interest-only mortgages the eventual sale of a property was suitable for clearing the debt, potentially on death or a move into care.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Late last year the Britain's financial watchdog published research revealing that there are currently 1.67 million full interest-only and part capital repayment mortgage accounts outstanding in the UK.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">They represent 17.6 per cent of all outstanding mortgage accounts and over the next few years increasing numbers will require repayment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Furthermore, the FCA found that 70 per cent of all interest-only and part capital repayment mortgages are held by customers aged over 45.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the proportion of 45 to 54-year-old mortgage holders with an interest‑only residential mortgage is higher than for all UK adults at 15 per cent compared with 11 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to the FCA's own data, those aged 65 and over with a mortgage are also significantly over‑represented when it comes to interest‑only mortgages.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">At first glance, there is nothing special about Churchill Court in Harrow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With its nondescript brick buildings and gated car park tucked behind a railway line, it looks like many other office blocks dotted across modern Britain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But this anonymous site on the outer edge of London is at the heart of a money-laundering scandal that allegedly stretches all the way to the Kremlin – and is threatening to overwhelm one of Europe’s biggest lenders, Denmark’s Danske Bank.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Churchill Court is the given address of Lantana Trade LLP, a secretive British company which was a major Danske client and is reportedly linked to Russian premier Vladimir Putin himself.</p><img id="i-60f3b2c2e5ebf7d9" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/01/18/4676784-6228287-image-m-2_1538415454210.jpg" height="362" width="634" alt="Dirty money: It is claimed that the Estonian branch of Danske laundered as much as £175bn of toxic cash for companies like Lantana" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is now claimed that the Estonian branch of Danske laundered as much as £175bn of toxic cash for companies like Lantana.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lantana – which was a customer of Danske for 11 months – was a limited liability partnership (LLP), a type of British company which allows its real owners to hide who they are. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was registered to Churchill Court in Harrow – although the firm is not thought to have employed any staff there – and was officially owned by companies in the Marshall Islands and Seychelles, both seen as notorious tax havens.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The allegations have triggered a crisis that forced Danske’s chief executive Thomas Borgen to resign yesterday and sparked a criminal investigation in Britain – the National Crime Agency is investigating the activities of one of the LLPs served by Danske. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And there are fresh calls for the UK to crack down on dirty money flooding our financial system.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Robert Barrington of campaign group Transparency International UK said: ‘Whilst the Government has made a series of announcements about cracking down on dirty money, the UK still offers an array of services which have been abused by those looking to hide their illicit wealth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It’s time the Government took strong action to ensure British companies cannot be abused for criminal activity and there is greater confidence in the integrity of the UK company register.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lantana’s shady activities first came to light when Howard Wilkinson, head of markets at Danske in Estonia, started looking into some of the lender’s customers and was shocked by what he found.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He realised that Lantana had filed false accounts with British authorities, claiming it was a dormant firm doing nothing. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, millions of pounds a day were being transferred through Lantana’s bank account as part of a complex series of transactions consistent with money-laundering behaviour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Further investigation suggested Lantana was linked to Promsberbank, a little-known bank in Podolsk, outside Moscow.</p><img id="i-84e5786029db2750" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/01/18/4677204-6228287-image-m-6_1538416319999.jpg" height="360" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-ecb479bb5c0ea0db" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/01/18/4677202-6228287-image-a-7_1538416345766.jpg" height="360" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">One member of this lender’s board was Igor Putin, the cousin of Russia’s president. A major shareholder was Alexander Grigoriev, a banker who is alleged to have ties to Russian intelligence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After Danske carried out a preliminary investigation, its Estonia office was reportedly visited by two Russians, one of whom is said to have asked bank staff: ‘Do you really feel you can walk home safely at night?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wilkinson told Danske’s board in 2013 that British LLPs were the most popular way for shady customers in Estonia to shift money around. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Estonian branch handled cash on behalf of 15,000 foreign customers, and UK firms were the second-biggest client group within this number after Russians.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In blistering notes to bosses, Wilkinson warned that Danske had breached regulatory requirements, ‘behaved unethically’ and suffered ‘a near-total process failure’. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But to begin with, his concerns were largely ignored – partly because the Estonian operation was a prized money spinner.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">So when Wilkinson raised concerns, little was done. An audit team from Danske looked into the claims and the lender later decided to wind down the Estonian unit serving foreign customers – but no action was taken against those responsible and the alarm was not raised with the authorities.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eventually a frustrated Wilkinson decided to go public. Danske launched a full internal investigation in 2017 and global anger mounted as the scale of the problem became clear.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A report by law firm Bruun &amp; Hjejle this month revealed that £175billionn of toxic cash had flowed through Danske, making it one of the biggest money laundering scandals of all time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Borgen, 54, was forced to resign but even this may not fully expose the true level of the debacle, as the law firm is a long-time partner of Danske and its conclusions have been dismissed as a whitewash by critics.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One source who had seen the raw data handled by Bruun &amp; Hjejle said its conclusions had let the board off the hook.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">European justice commissioner Vera Jourova said: ‘This is the biggest scandal which we have now in Europe.’</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Lantana – which was a customer of Danske for 11 months – was a limited liability partnership (LLP), a type of British company which allows its real owners to hide who they are.

<h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Buy-to-let is cheaper than ever as landlords exit the market</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bank of England rates data shows the average buy-to-let mortgage rate at 75 per cent loan-to-value has also plummeted to just 2.27 per cent - the lowest since records began in 2012.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The buy-to-let sector has been battered in recent years as tax relief on mortgage interest is withdrawn and replaced with a tax credit. On top of this landlords now pay tax on their revenue rather than profit after mortgage costs.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">In addition, the buy-to-let market has been hurt as stamp duty for new purchases was slapped with a 3 per cent surcharge back in 2016, making outlays for new investors considerably more expensive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chris Sykes, mortgage consultant at Private Finance, suggests the low rates are being introduced to entice potential new borrowers as the sector becomes less attractive as an investment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, Lloyds Bank's buy-to-let arm BM Solutions today announced changes to a range of mortgage and valuations fees.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A mortgage account fee of £295 will no longer apply to products in the BM Solutions range. The lender has capped revaluation fees at £300 and also removed a £100 administration fee.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> Nationwide's buy-to-let arm The Mortgage Works this week cut its two-year 65 per cent loan-to-value fixed rate to 1.49 per cent with a £1,995 fee.

You will not get any increase if you defer for less than nine weeks </p><img id="i-b716fef2e8635531" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/12/4874677B00000578-5297675-image-m-4_1516625631496.jpg" height="404" width="306" alt="Steve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Who might face pitfalls by deferring their state pension?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are some people for whom deferring is almost certainly not a good idea.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These would be people on income-related benefits such as pension credit or help with rent or council tax. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During the period of deferral,  you do not build up extra pension for any week in which you are getting pension credit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In addition, once you did start receiving the pension, any additional rate of payment could be clawed back in whole or in part from your means-tested benefits, so it would probably represent a poor deal.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Who might benefit from delaying payments?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are two groups in particular for whom deferring is worth thinking about.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first is those who are planning to work on past state pension age. This is because any state pension you draw is added to your taxable income for the year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are earning more than the tax-free personal allowance (currently £11,850 per year) then the whole of your state pension will be subject to income tax.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If your total taxable income goes above £46,350, then some of your state pension could even be taxed at 40 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By contrast, if you defer taking your state pension until you have stopped earning then all of your personal allowance of £11,850 will be available to be set against your state pension and other pensions, meaning you will probably pay less tax overall.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A second group of people for whom deferring might be attractive is those who expect to live a long time in retirement.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS money" data-version="2" id="mol-a03eb610-c17c-11e8-84f8-87c6fdb4c4ea">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">What is the triple lock?</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Rises in the state pension are presently calculated on the basis of something called the 'Triple Lock'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This means that payouts always increase by whatever is the the highest of inflation, average earnings or 2.5 per cent. </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you defer your pension for a year you are effectively taking a gamble that the extra amount you get each year on your state pension once you start drawing it will eventually more than offset the year you went without a pension.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As you get an extra 5.8 per cent for deferring, you would need to receive a pension for about 18 years to recover the money you missed in the first year, not taking account of the interest you could have earned on that money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Given that the average 65-year-old man is likely to live to 86 according to official figures (see <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/articles/howlongwillmypensionneedtolast/2015-03-27">here</a>) it is only those who are longer-lived on average who are likely to benefit most from deferral (apart from the taxation point noted above). </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">How will a delay affect future increases in your state pension?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finally, it is worth being aware that the extra amount of state pension you receive for putting off taking your pension is treated in a slightly different way when it comes to future annual increases to take account of inflation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whereas your original pension amount is uprated at least by the growth in average earnings (and currently by the more generous ‘triple lock’ policy) the extra pension you receive for deferral is only uprated in line with price inflation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This probably doesn’t make a huge difference to the calculation but it is something to be aware of.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can find more information about deferring your state pension <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gov.uk/deferring-state-pension">here.</a> </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-d72b26c0-88f3-11e8-9b6c-9b19f8e41faa">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title"><span class="mol-style-small">How much is the state pension?</span></h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The basic state pension is currently £125.95 a week.  It is topped up by additional state pension entitlements - S2P and Serps - accrued during working years.</font> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The two-tier state system has changed for people retiring since 6 April 2016, when it was replaced by a new 'flat rate' state pension.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Mark Mobius is an obsessive. He works out at a gym like a man possessed at least twice a day to keep trim; is meticulous about the food he eats; and, in the little spare time he has, frantically writes finance books.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is a character trait he carries through into his professional life. For more than 30 years, Mobius has been obsessed about emerging markets, travelling to every corner of the world in search of companies he can invest in – often courtesy of a private jet made available by employers keen to keep him sweet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the pursuit of a hot stock, he has avoided bullets in the Philippines and run like the clappers from armed carjackers in Brazil.</p><img id="i-afd1bde7354b31b5" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/09/29/18/4633648-6222281-image-m-33_1538240601667.jpg" height="434" width="634" alt="Mark Mobius, now 82 years old, is dubbed by many as the 'Pied Piper' of emerging markets" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">No wonder Mobius, now 82 years old, is dubbed by many as the 'Pied Piper' of emerging markets. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The bald octogenarian, born in New York to a German father and Puerto Rican mother, eats, sleeps and breathes emerging markets.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although it is not as big as anticipated (Mobius was hoping to raise £200 million from investors) he is enthusiastic – even though he will no longer have use of the Gulfstream jet that Franklin made available as he scoured the world in search of new emerging market ideas. Now, he will just have to make do with chartered flights (first class, naturally).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I catch him for a chat before he heads to the gym near Mobius Capital Partners' new offices a stone's throw from London's Victoria railway station, dragging along with him Carlos Hardenberg – one of two former emerging markets colleagues he has persuaded to join him in his new venture.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Every day I learn something new,' he says.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The fact that Mobius Capital Partners is owned in equal parts by him, Hardenberg and Greg Konieczny (like Hardenberg, poached from Franklin Templeton) ups the ante. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As does the fact that between them, the three managers, plus a small group of support employees, have ploughed a combined £5.7 million into the new fund.

A fixed bike is his preferred workout because he can multi-task, pedalling away furiously while replying to emails or reading. He also tones up with weights. Work is based around meeting the management of companies he is invested in.

'Back in 1987, we had Black Monday and a bear stock market. Sentiment was not good and the thought of launching an emerging markets trust in the turbulence of all that a couple of years later was seen by some as crazy. But we did and it was incredibly successful.' Templeton Emerging Markets now has assets of £2 billion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mobius says: 'Today, there is a pessimism and nervousness in the air but as investment managers we see it as a chance to get in at close to the bottom.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The approach the three will take towards the companies they invest in is hands-on. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They will not hold back if they believe corporate governance changes – for example, the appointment of a new director – can help drive up a company's share price. They will also cajole management into making business improvements and embrace environmental issues. 'If I have had a failing in the past it is in building big diverse emerging market portfolios and then not selling holdings when they stop performing,' admits Mobius.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money floatRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-d2b69dc0-c57c-11e8-a689-d3958bfa2bf2">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Free guide to investing</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">How to be a successful investor is This is Money's easy to understand and jargon-free guide to investing.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/diyinvesting/article-4339358/How-successful-investor-free-guide-investing.html">download it here</a> or by clicking on the button above.</p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This time around, the intention is to hold between 20 and 30 stocks and give them lots of care and attention.

It responded by teaming up with Vienna-based caterer Do &amp; Co. 'The perception of the airline changed overnight,' says Mobius.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says he will spend half his time travelling the globe and visiting companies.

If you turn up to work at a construction site and you are operating a 16-ton digger and you had six pints the night before, or you have been smoking cannabis, that's going to affect you and your ability to think, take decisions and react. You can become a risk to yourself and to other people.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Cash pointed out that builders often work away from home and stay together in budget hotels which can lead to the regular drinking of alcohol.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There will be a tendency to drink a lot more than they would at home,' he said. 'They are going to want to fill their time and will potentially go down the pub to have a few beers.'</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesperson for Barratt said: 'The health and safety of our people, contractors, customers and the general public is our number one priority.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He added: 'We assessed our existing drug and alcohol testing policies and introduced additional random testing in line with our commitment to the highest health and safety standards.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to the Government's website on workers' rights, staff cannot be made to take a drugs test. However, if they refuse when the employer has good grounds for testing, they could face disciplinary action.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Barratt built 17,579 homes in the year to June – the most of any of the major housebuilding companies.

Good old Nationwide, dependable Yorkshire, cuddly Bath.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe, but I promise you they will not enrich you. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A little bit of interest here and there, but no more.

A tool allowing you to control investments under one roof – and in real time. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wake up in the middle of the night and provided your internet is working, you can switch on the computer and see the latest state of play on your investments. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are so minded, you can even buy and sell shares, or increase the amount of money you are diverting from your bank account every month to purchase new investments. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Welcome to the world of the online investment account, or the investment platform, as industry bods like to call it. One investment home, open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are remotely internet-savvy, open one. It will kick-start an interest in investments and prompt you to learn more. A spark will be lit. I have friends who used to talk football over a pint.

You can hold shares in it, investment funds, bonds – even cash, although I would advise against that given pitiful savings rates.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can invest regularly, make additional contributions if you come into some extra money (a bonus at work, for example) and turn off the contribution tap when there are pressures on the family budget. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is a pot you can access (tax-free) if you need to, although the best strategy is to hold – and hold. From acorns come mighty oaks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the best thing – back to rule one – is that you can use an online investment account to run an Isa from. Exclusively or alongside a separate investment portfolio. Two accounts under one umbrella.</p><img id="i-da7931de7249726d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/01/14/4593514-6221793-Jeff_Prestridge_says_utilising_tax_relief_on_a_pension_can_help_-a-2_1538399527055.jpg" height="388" width="634" alt="Jeff Prestridge says utilising tax relief on a pension can help you make money" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">USE YOUR TAX RELIEF ON A PENSION</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">While most of the news on pensions is grim – company pension schemes in deficit, employers reneging on pension promises – the fact remains that this tax-friendly vehicle should be at the heart of any long-term investment portfolio. So, if your employer provides one, join it. Do not be tempted to opt out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why? Because your contributions will benefit from tax relief. For a basic-rate taxpayer, this means a £100 contribution only costs £80 – for a higher-rate taxpayer, £60. </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also, nearly all employers are now obliged under so-called auto-enrolment rules to contribute into your pension pot. A compelling mix – tax relief and an employer top-up. Irresistible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These days, unless you are in public service, your employer is likely to offer you a pension where your ultimate retirement fund will be determined by how much has been put in and the subsequent performance of the investments you or the pension manager have selected. So deficits are not an issue.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also, if your scheme is half-decent, it will allow you to see online how your pot is building – and enable contributions to be increased and investments (usually funds) changed. If you are self-employed or just fancy building your own pension pot, you can now set up a pension online – as part of your investment account. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, under that online umbrella, you could run a pension, an Isa and a standalone portfolio.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">INVEST A LITTLE A LOT – AND WATCH IT GROW</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Building investment wealth is a long-term endeavour. With a pension, you have no choice but to think about it as a retirement tool because withdrawals cannot be made until at least age 55. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But with Isas and investment portfolios, the onus is on you to use them to accumulate wealth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The best approach is to invest regularly, preferably monthly, even if it is just £30 or £50. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By setting up a direct debit to pay into your investment account, you will get into the habit of not missing the money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You will be surprised how rewarding regular investing can be. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you had invested £50 a month 15 years ago via a fund tracking the performance of the UK stock market, you would have squirreled away £9,000. But in the process you would have built an investment worth just short of £16,700. Not a bad return for regular prudence.</p><div class="item">

They then take out a loan on the price of the car plus interest. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But each month customers only repay the difference between the cost of the car and its estimated worth after an agreed date – usually three or four years.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I warned against UK TV Care as long ago as February last year. It was tricking people then, offering a scheme to insure satellite TV equipment. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The scheme was provided by a sister company called Sky Protect Limited, the same name as the genuine warranty scheme offered to customers by the genuine Sky TV business.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Neither of the two rip-off companies was authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority to market any kind of insurance or warranty cover. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They claimed customers were protected by the Financial Ombudsman Service, but this was a lie.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the time, the regulator refused to comment on UK TV Care. Four months later though, it put a warning on its website that consumers should be 'especially wary'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The watchdog explained: 'We believe this firm has been providing financial services or products in the UK without our authorisation.' It issued the same warning about Sky Protect Limited.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what has happened since then? It looks as though the only action taken has been by the real Sky TV company. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It won a legal order to change the name of the bogus Sky Protect Limited to the rather less catchy 09984293 Limited. In May, that company was compulsorily struck off by officials at Companies House.</p><img id="i-22c56c24f826c834" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/09/29/15/4630692-6221791-One_reader_said_it_took_21_months_to_get_their_boiler_serviced_a-a-4_1538232960287.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="One reader said it took 21 months to get their boiler serviced as a British Gas Home Care customer (stock image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">That left UK TV Care Limited.

Last January, the pair told Companies House they had quit, leaving nobody in charge. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Proceedings are now in hand to strike off the British company, but it looks as though the name has been registered in Spain to allow it to carry on scamming under the same title.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I invited UK TV Care to comment. It did not reply. I also invited the Financial Conduct Authority to say what action it had taken since it put a warning on its website over a year ago. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">UK TV Care has been using an address in London, and City telephone numbers, so surely the regulator could have done more than just put a page on its website? An injunction perhaps, or court action to have the company liquidated?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the watchdog refused to say anything except to fall back on its usual mantra that it cannot comment on individual firms – a neat way of concealing the likely explanation that it cannot discuss its action because it has failed to take any.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>It took 21 months to get my boiler serviced </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Mrs M.A.L. writes:</strong> <span class="mol-style-italic">I have been a British Gas Home Care customer for years and my boiler used to be serviced late every year. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Last year, I telephoned in September and was told the first available service appointment was not until January of this year. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">This was subsequently cancelled by British Gas as was an appointment for March. Then a third appointment that should have been in May. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Finally, British Gas kept an appointment in July, but this was the first boiler service since October 2016. I pay £50 a month for Home Care, but British Gas insists it has fulfilled its contract.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This has been an awkward subject for British Gas. It was hauled over the coals by the Advertising Standards Authority for a TV commercial offering a 'yearly boiler service'. This was backed up by a contract that promised a 'check each year'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, the service visits could be almost two years apart. You were told that the visit in 2016 fulfilled the contract for 2016-17 – and a visit in July this year met the terms of the contract for 2017-18. In British Gas's eyes, that is a yearly check.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The advertising watchdog ruled that the adverts were misleading and banned them, but it has no powers to change the Home Care contracts themselves – only the way they are advertised.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">British Gas told me: 'We are very sorry for the poor customer service that Mrs L. experienced in arranging to have her boiler serviced as part of her Home Care agreement.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has stopped using the misleading claims in its adverts and is making the terms of its scheme clearer.

A leasehold only gives you the right to live in a property for the period of the lease — and you must pay ground rent to the landlord.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But 'onerous' terms attached to some ground leases let landowners double this rent every decade, costing homeowners thousands. On top of this, households face hefty fees for changes such as installing double glazing or replacing flooring.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Javid said it was 'unacceptable for homebuyers to be exploited through unnecessary leaseholds, unjustifiable charges and onerous ground rent terms'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Under new rules, ground rents on new leases — for both houses and flats — will be set close to zero.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Government has also pledged to ban leaseholds for 'almost all' new builds. The backlash against leaseholds has already seen most developers abandon the practice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Law Commission is consulting on reforms to make the process of purchasing a freehold 'easier, cheaper and quicker' and remove a requirement for leaseholders to have owned their property for two years before they can purchase the freehold.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But nothing is proposed to stop the owners of existing leaseholds making large rent increases or charging huge sums for people to buy the freeholds of their homes. It will also not mirror Scotland, where leaseholds are banned.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Campaigners say that the proposals do not go far enough.</p><img id="i-db9048bb8f5ca6be" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/09/25/23/4547602-6207469-image-a-3_1537912923534.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Trapped: Kevin and Jeanette Sephton pay £200 a year in ground rent, but this will double to £400 in 2025.

They also pay a £100 annual service charge for estate maintenance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To make their home more attractive to buyers, the couple looked into buying their freehold. When they purchased the house from Countryside Properties, they believed that this would cost £3,000 to £4,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the Sephtons found the freehold was owned by a third party. And, after contacting that firm, D.A.T.S Holdings, the couple were told they would have to pay £23,000 for the freehold, plus legal fees.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kevin, an engineer, and his wife, a consumer service worker, say they received insufficient information about their leasehold at the time of purchase.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kevin says: 'Countryside told us that we could purchase the freehold at some stage, but we weren't given details. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Our solicitor, recommended by Countryside, also failed to point out the increase in ground rent. We feel we have been mis-sold.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Countryside said the site where the Sephtons bought their home was one where it had a building licence, but didn't own the land.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman said: 'Information provided to customers will always make clear whether the property is sold on a leasehold or a freehold basis. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All customers also receive independent advice from their chosen solicitor, whose role it is to explain the type of ownership and the terms of any leasehold.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another Taylor Wimpey homebuyer, Andrea Millward, 37, wants to sell the property she shares with husband Roi, 31, and children Sienna, seven, and Isaac, four, so the family can move abroad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet no estate agent will touch it. Andrea and Roi had bought their home in Prescot, Merseyside, in 2011 for £153,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But when it was valued by an independent surveyor, they were told the leasehold had knocked £42,000 off its saleable value.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Andrea says she was originally told she could buy the freehold after two years for ten times the £295 annual ground rent — nearly £3,000. But she has yet to find out how much she must now pay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Andrea, a bank adviser, says: 'We were looking at moving to New Zealand, because my husband could find work out there, but now we can't sell.

This is because the freehold price is based on the value of the land and likely rental income.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the rent increases are uncertain, it reduces the value of the land and so the cost of the freehold.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, a freehold priced at £30,000 to £40,000 under the current system could fall to £10,000. Taylor Wimpey has put aside £130 million to cover the costs for homeowners and compensating the firms who own the freeholds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, homeowners will still end up paying more for freeholds than originally quoted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They also fear that RPI — set higher than the more widely- used Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation — could lead to ground rents increasing by a greater sum than under existing arrangements.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last month, RPI was 3.5 per cent, while CPI was 2.7 per cent. RPI reached a recent high point of 4.8 per cent in 2010 and 2011 but, back in 1975, it reached 24.9 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Andrea Millward, who faces a maximum annual ground rent of £9,440 a year after 50 years, if it keeps doubling, says: 'If RPI hits 7.2 per cent, it becomes as onerous as the system of ground rent doubling. And RPI has been higher in the past.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And Jo Darbyshire adds: 'Even if I go onto RPI, buying my freehold will cost £10,000. So I'm still out of pocket.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Homeowners also fear if they change to RPI, they'll have to sign a contract stopping them from taking legal action over mis-selling. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'A Taylor Wimpey spokeswoman says that leases provided by the company 'were clear' and 'all customers received independent advice from regulated legal firms'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We would expect solicitors to explain all aspects of the transaction, including ownership and any rent reviews,' she adds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The firm said the 'vast majority' of homes are sold as freeholds, apart from in a few areas such as the North West, where 'selling houses on a leasehold basis was a long-standing custom'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It added that it has no legal obligation to notify leaseholders about disposing of freeholds or give them the right of first refusal.</p><img id="i-771fd2babc391275" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/09/25/20/4544870-6207469-image-a-2_1537905342040.jpg" height="418" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Sleepless nights and a £15,000 bill</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although she has escaped the leasehold trap, it took university lecturer Cath Williams 15 months, cost £15,000 and caused her 'anxiety, sleepless nights and the onset of eczema'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cath, a lecturer in radiography at the University of Liverpool, bought a new build town house from Taylor Wimpey in December 2011.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The divorced mother of two grown-up daughters says that her lease was 'complex, used legalese and was completely beyond my understanding'. She adds: 'I am used to reading academic papers, but could not make sense of (it)'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cath paid £149,950 for her home in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, which had £295 annual ground rent, rising with RPI every ten years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I didn't know it then, but that is considered onerous, as ground rent was more than 0.1 per cent of the property value,' she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And she only discovered her home was leasehold at the point of reservation. Cath says: 'I challenged it immediately — there was no indication in the sales information about the lease. The saleswoman replied that it was 'virtual freehold', over 999 years, and very cheap . . . 'pennies every month'.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She says Taylor Wimpey referred her to a solicitor and told her she had only 28 days to complete or she would lose her £500 deposit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She adds: 'I asked [the solicitors] if I could buy the freehold and they said it was not possible.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cath feels that the solicitors did not explain the law, her rights to buy the freehold, or the leasehold costs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Two years later, the 61-year-old was told an investor had bought her freehold.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She eventually purchased the freehold for £7,600 in July, but legal fees and costs doubled the actual bill. Cath had to cash in a pension and borrow £5,000 from an elderly aunt.

Smithson</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Manager: </strong>Terry Smith and team</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Rating:</strong> You could coin it in</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Investment house Fundsmith, built from scratch eight years ago by City maverick Terry Smith, has earned itself a fine reputation on the back of the performance of Fundsmith Equity, its mainstream fund.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A £10,000 investment in the fund at launch in November 2010 is now worth £40,110 – more than twice an investor would have got from a fund tracking the performance of the FTSE All Share Index.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fundsmith is now launching investment trust Smithson, a fund investing in a mix of small and medium-sized global companies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Smithson will be run in the same way as Fundsmith Equity, investing in a tight portfolio of quality stocks – around 25 – with the emphasis on holding them long term.</p><img id="i-8aabf9277cd84226" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/09/22/17/4476186-0-image-m-51_1537634263153.jpg" height="253" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Companies with market capitalisations of anything between £500million and £15billion will be targeted with an emphasis on resilient businesses capable of delivering strong revenues. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although the new trust will not be directly managed by Smith – Simon Barnard and Will Morgan have been brought in from Goldman Sachs to run it – he will oversee. He is also putting £25million of his own personal wealth into the trust at launch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jason Hollands, a director of wealth manager Tilney, says the trust is ‘targeting an underserved part of world stock markets’ and should appeal to investors looking to broaden their portfolios. He is also reassured that Smithson will have a similar ‘buy and hold’ philosophy to that of Fundsmith Equity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hollands adds: ‘The fact that Smith is putting his own money into the trust is a vote of confidence in the people he has hired to manage it and, of course, he will take a close interest in the trust’s progress.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, is a fan. He says: ‘The trust will use an investment process which has served Fundsmith Equity well – identifying quality companies with good growth prospects, trading at a reasonable price.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Launch shares can be applied for until October 12 with share dealings starting a week later. The trust’s annual management charge will be 0.9 per cent.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">2. Mobius</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Manager</strong>: Mark Mobius</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Rating</strong>: You could coin it in</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like Smithson, this new trust takes its name from a stock market legend – 82-year-old Mark Mobius, ‘Mr Emerging Markets’. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mobius was behind the launch of the country’s first emerging markets trust in 1989 – Templeton Emerging Markets – and managed it with distinction until late 2015. During his time at the helm, he delivered investors an annual return in excess of 12 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new trust has ambitious targets – annual long-term returns of between 12 and 15 per cent from a portfolio of between 20 and 30 emerging market companies.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">While some may say Mobius is a bit long in the tooth, he has brought two emerging markets specialists with him from asset manager Franklin Templeton – Carlos Hardenberg and Grzegorz Konieczny. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The former took over the wheel at Templeton Emerging Markets in October 2015.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like Mobius, they know the markets inside out. Although emerging markets are unsettled by currency crises in both Turkey and Argentina, and trade tensions between China and the United States, Mobius says the timing of the new launch could not be better.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says: ‘Today, there is a pessimism and nervousness in the air but as investment managers we see it as a chance to get in at close to the bottom.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tilney’s Hollands agrees, arguing that on valuation grounds many emerging stock markets look relatively cheap compared to markets such as the United States. He adds: ‘No doubt the Mobius team see this as a great time to start off with a clean sheet of paper.’</p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">The deadline for shares in the launch is Tuesday with dealings commencing at the start of October. The trust’s annual management charge is one per cent.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">3. AVI Japan Opportunity</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Manager</strong>: Joe Bauernfreund</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Rating</strong>: A good solid bet </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Investment house Asset Value Investors is hoping to raise a minimum £100million for this trust that will invest in a tight portfolio of Japanese companies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although Asset is not a household name, it manages an established investment trust – the £1billion global British Empire. This has outperformed peers over the past three years – a return of 76 per cent against 69 per cent for the average global growth trust – but underperformed over five.</p><img id="i-7ff618b0f958cd6d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/22/17/05B2A488000007D0-6196749-image-a-59_1537634725631.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="New trust: Itwill invest in a tight portfolio of Japanese companies" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Reassuringly, the fund will not be a big distraction for Asset's tight investment team whose modus operandi is to identify undervalued companies and then push for change that will result in that undervaluation (hopefully) being eliminated. This approach will be applied to the new trust.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Joe Bauernfreund, manager of British Empire, will front the new trust. He says: ‘There are many listed smaller companies in Japan that are only waking up to the need for corporate governance reform and to become more shareholder oriented.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">' We aim to buy some of these and then engage with management to create value for us as shareholders. This could be done by companies releasing cash sitting on their balance sheets via special dividends.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The trust’s annual management charge is one per cent and the launch’s closing date is October 18 with share dealings commencing five days later. The trust is likely to pay a dividend although there is no commitment to dividend growth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brian Dennehy, director of investment fund scrutineer FundExpert, believes Japanese smaller companies offer investors the potential for attractive long term returns. </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many companies, he says, are ‘undervalued and under-researched’. But rather than take a gamble on a new trust, he suggests investors should look at established funds. These include Baillie Gifford Japanese Smaller Companies and M&amp;G Japan Smaller Companies.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">4. Merian Chrysalis</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Managers</strong>: Richard Watts and Nick Williamson</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Rating</strong>: A good solid bet</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This trust will be managed by Merian Global Investors – Old Mutual Global Investors as was – and invest in UK unquoted companies. It will hope to make money as the businesses it buys move from private ownership through to a listing on the UK stock market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The managers, Richard Watts and Nick Williamson, are established investors in small and medium-sized listed UK companies. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, over the past five years, Watts has delivered a 103 per cent return at the helm of fund Old Mutual UK Mid Cap – a performance only beaten by three funds in its UK all companies peer group.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Investing in unquoted companies is not their speciality, but the duo insist they are tooled up to spot businesses that will successfully make the transition from private to shareholder ownership. Merian Global Investors is led by respected investment manager Richard Buxton.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The annual management fee is competitive at 0.5 per cent although there is also an additional performance charge which will lop off a fifth of any annual return in excess of eight per cent. Launch details will be confirmed early next month.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>We run the slide rule over the offerings from Terry Smith, Mark Mobius and others. Each trust is given a subjective rating – with five gold coins being the highest. Shares in the funds will trade on the London Stock Exchange and the aim will be to make money for long-term investors – and, of course, the managers themselves. But the investment strategies they are employing are as different as chalk and cheese.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>Mail on Sunday</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Jeff Prestridge for The Mail on Sunday</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-09-24T13:44:55.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>The four big new investment trusts including Terry Smith and Mobius</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-09-24T13:44:55.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Share Tips Fund Tips</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/investing/article-6194757/Hes-battling-Unilever-UK-jump-gurus-gravy-Train.html" title="INVESTMENT EXTRA: Star fund manager Nick Train is battling to keep Unilever in the UK: so should you buy into his Lindsell equity funds?"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/diyinvesting/article-6182247/THE-PRUDENT-INVESTOR-Ten-years-great-crash-just-safe-cash-today.html" title="THE PRUDENT INVESTOR: It wasn't Lehman but Icesave's collapse that spooked British savers - so a decade later, just how safe is your cash?"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/diyinvesting/article-6185769/The-750-exit-fees-Isa-suddenly-got-interested.html" title="SIMON LAMBERT: It's hard to get interested in exit fees...until you get hit with £750 to move your Isa"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/investing/article-6167425/Investing-market-collapsed-decade-ago-delivered-137-profit.html" title="Be greedy when others are fearful: How investing as the stock market collapsed a decade ago could have earned a 137% profit"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/diyinvesting/article-1718291/Pick-best-cheapest-investment-Isa-platform.html" title="How to choose the best (and cheapest) DIY investing Isa - and our pick of the platforms"></link></item><item><title>The ten most expensive countries for petrol revealed: Hong Kong tops the list but Britain doesn't feature despite highest prices in four years</title><link>http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/cars/article-6181535/Petrol-price-index-Hong-Kong-expensive-UK-not-10.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Sep 2018 08:02:44 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6181535</guid><description><![CDATA[This is Money's 2018 petrol price index has found Britain lags behind Barbados, Greece, Italy and Liechtenstein when it comes to prices at the pumps.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The most confusing part for many savers is what counts as an institution.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, within Lloyds Banking Group, Halifax, Birmingham Midshires, older AA Savings accounts, Saga, Bank of Wales, Intelligent Finance and St James's Place are all covered by Bank of Scotland's licence, but Lloyds has a separate licence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here is a <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/meandmymoney/article-1630421/Savings-compensation-protection-Bank-ownership-licences.html">full list of who owns which bank or building society</a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's also worth knowing that not all banks are covered by the UK scheme, FSCS.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, ICICI, Allied Irish Bank, FirstSave from the First Bank of Nigeria and Al Rayan Bank are all 100 pc protected by FSCS. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But others operate under a passporting system with the European Economic Area, which means that you would need to claim from their home compensation scheme if they got into problems.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These include Agri Bank (Malta), Ikano (Sweden), Fidor (Germany), RCI (France) and Triodos (Netherlands). All EU countries must operate a €100,000 limit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Spreading your cash around can create administrative headaches when it comes to keeping track of where your money is, as well as interest paid and tax due.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first £1,000 of interest on cash is tax-free for basic-rate taxpayers and £500 for higher-rate payers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The internet site Savings Champion has a free tracker service which allows you to register your savings accounts online. You can log in and see how much you are earning.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For those with large sums — say £250,000 or more — there is a fee-based cash advice service.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hargreaves Lansdown has launched Active Savings, which gives access to a limited number of fixed-rate deals. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This aims to bring customers' savings all under one roof to make administration simpler — just as investment funds can all be handled on one platform. The service provides savings alerts when rates change and savers are covered to the full £85,000 per bank.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back in 2008, we had planned a Money Mail story warning savers that Icesave was in peril. Events swept past us.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The collapse came a year after a run on Northern Rock, and the Government was eventually forced to nationalise it in February 2008.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At that time, the leading credit rating agencies and the regulators were all giving Landsbanki a clean bill of health.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ten years on, Gordon Brown, who was Prime Minister at the time, has warned that the world could be 'sleepwalking' into another financial crisis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe he's right — or maybe he's just become a grumpy old man.

And what about my credit score? How was I going to get a phone contract if I ever moved back to London?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's kept me awake at night. These fraudsters are master manipulators. They've already managed to find enough of my personal information to trick the bank. How can I convince it otherwise?' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Banks are supposed to adhere to strict regulations when opening accounts for new customers. Most ask for identification, such as a passport or driving licence, and proof of address, such as a bank statement or utility bill.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Firms can carry out further checks on higher-risk customers. For example, they can cross-check documents with credit reference agencies Equifax and Experian to validate a given address.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But experts say banks rarely do this — and every major bank has refused to tell Money Mail what its verification procedure is.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back in June, we revealed a list of 82 accounts opened by criminals at High Street banks using fake IDs and counterfeit utility bills that had been investigated by the Metropolitan Police.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Around half of these accounts were at HSBC.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Former Metropolitan Police detective Suzanne Raftery, who is now head of investigations at Requite Solutions, a scam recovery firm, says that it is easier than you might expect for fraudsters to steal someone's identity and open an account in their name. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She says: 'Banks just have to give the documents the once-over and check the names on the documents match.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There are tools available to verify this information and banks could definitely do more to spot the fakes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There are bound to be countless accounts opened with forged documents, but the banks will never tell you. They just hide behind data protection.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Richard believes that someone was able to open an account in his name using a letter sent to his old London address after he moved out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, HSBC refused to explain how this could have been allowed to happen or why it closed the account in February.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was only after Money Mail stepped in that HSBC agreed to write off the debt and said Richard will not be contacted again.</p><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The bank has told Cifas that Richard has been the victim of impersonation, to prevent his details being misused again. However, Richard still does not know the effect this fraud will have on his credit file.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Money Mail has also reported the matter to industry regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The FCA says that it has passed it on to the relevant department, but cannot comment on individual cases.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman says: 'Protecting customers against fraud is a top priority for us and the whole financial services sector.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Steve Webb replies: </strong>It is not surprising that you are confused to be quoted such wildly differing pension amounts for pension pots of roughly the same size.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The main reason for this is that some of your policies have extremely valuable guarantees attached to them which I will describe in a moment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It may help if we consider first the simple case of a standard ‘pot of money’ pension where you pay money in, it is invested and then you use the final pot to buy an income for life or an ‘annuity’. </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">What do annuity rates typically run at right now?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the case of your pension pot worth £22,000, the company is giving you a figure for the annual pension they would pay you at 65, and they assume that this annual pension would increase each year in line with inflation – something called an ‘index-linked annuity’.</p><img id="i-b716fef2e8635531" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/12/4874677B00000578-5297675-image-m-4_1516625631496.jpg" height="404" width="306" alt="Steve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The £600 figure means you would get an annual income at retirement of roughly 3 per cent of the value of the pot, which is not unusual for an index-linked annuity at today’s interest rates. </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">What guarantees might come attached that boost your annuity rate?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some types of pension offer something more valuable than this, called a ‘guaranteed annuity rate’ or GAR.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When such a product was taken out perhaps a decade or two ago, the pension company offered an extra feature. This was to guarantee you a minimum annuity rate, regardless of what happened to interest rates subsequently.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Given that interest rates have plunged since these policies were sold, a guaranteed rate set back then is now extremely valuable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is not unusual for GAR rates to be in the high single figures (for example, 8 per cent or more) compared with a typical annuity rate at 65 of around 5 per cent today.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Note though that these apply for annuities which do not rise in line with inflation – so-called 'level' annuities.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lots of policies were sold with these guarantees and they are now very expensive for pension providers to honour. For that reason they are no longer sold.</p><div class="moduleHalf"><div class="money item">

This is definitely true with BA on long haul flights. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Airlines usually want to dissuade travellers from flying one-way particularly long haul or on more expensive airlines as it's easier for them to then schedule flights. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course if you do pay cash you can just buy a cheaper return ticket and then only use half of it in some instances. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most airlines say in the terms and conditions that if you don't use the outbound leg of your return they will cancel the second flight, so for this to work you must using the outbound leg and not the return. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And sometimes if you are travelling on business or visiting a string of different locations however it's hard to avoid booking a single trip. In these cases it could actually be worth using your Avios to purchase a seat, as technically compared to the price of the ticket you are getting bumper value.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, buy an off-peak flight to Cape Town  six months in advance and you will pay £1,673.41 (£227.41 in taxes) while a return will cost you from £677.01 (£358.01 in taxes) for the same dates.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the same single trip, you can cash in <span style="font-size: 16px;">16,250 Avios plus £193.87 in taxes, while a return costs 41,250 Avios and £227.41 in taxes.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you do the maths on this one, each Avios for the single trip here is worth a whopping 8.69p, while on the return trip it's 0.75p per Avios. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This example gets you bumper value but you won't always achieve this high a value from your Avios on all one-way trips so check the cost before you book.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On short haul flights,  you may also find one-way tickets are much cheaper as BA is competing with fighting off competition from budget airlines. </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Off-peak tickets save a bundle</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">It sounds an obvious tip, but it can have a huge impact on how much your points are actually worth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When you go through the booking process, off-peak tickets are shown with a green mark in the corner of the calendar on the British Airways Executive Club Avios site, but to check during the planning process there is actually an calendar you can view off peak dates on the website.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s hard to find, but if you visit the<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/executive-club/spending-avios/reward-flights"> British Airways Avios website </a>and scroll down to the 'working out the cost' tab you can bring up the calendar by clicking 'Learn more and view the British Airways peak and off-peak calendar'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here’s some examples from Avios however on the difference in how many airmiles you will have to hand over during peak vs off-peak times.</p><div class="money" id="mol-54bf8cc0-784b-11e8-b301-97dfc7986324"> <table class="mol-table" data-swipe-article="false" width="100%"> <caption class="wocc">HOW MANY AVIOS WILL I NEED?

These more expensive tickets come with seat reservations and a luggage allowance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here's a quick example:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Book six months in advance and you can fly to New York and back from London in for £559.41 in economy or £1,165.91 in premium economy. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Both include taxes of £361.41 and £451.91 respectively.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Avios costs are 26,000 (£373.30 in taxes) or 52,000 Avios (£451.09 in taxes).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you take taxes out of the equation as they are fairly similar, your 26,000 Avios are worth £606.50 - that's much as 2.3p per Avios.</p><img id="i-c949e361e77a69d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/29/15/05864AA0000007D0-5835835-image-a-2_1530281557726.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Parisian adventure? Using Avios to travel to the French capital gets you just over 1p per point" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Pay for part of your ticket with Avios rather than buying extra</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s incredibly frustrating when your Avios pot is just shy of the amount you need to cash in for your flights.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In these instances you have a couple of options, either use your Avios as part payment or buy a bundle of Avios to top up your pot and give you enough for the full flight. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When This is Money checked on a flight to New York you could pay for £190 of the cost of a flight with 37,000 Avios or the smallest part payment available was 20,000 Avios for £20. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On a short-haul flight to Paris the options were slightly different - between £150 off for 29,000 Avios and £10 for 1,000 points. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So the value on this is a between 0.5p-1p off your flight per point redeemed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what about buying extra points?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rob Burgess at Head for Points explains the cost of buying bundles of points.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says: 'The standard price is a shocking £31 for 1,000 (this includes a flat £15 handling fee which bumps up small purchases) through to £1,615 for the maximum 100,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'At standard rates, the price is 3.1p when buying 1,000, 2p when buying 5,000 and 1.6p when buying 35,000.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whether this is worth it will therefore depend on how much value you are getting per Avios point when you redeem them, but it's certainly not great value.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-4e474970-7858-11e8-963d-473da36e7caa">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TRICKS TO 'BUY' AVIOS FOR LESS</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Rob there is a clever trick for anyone with an American Express credit card linked to its Membership Rewards scheme.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He explains:' This is a neat little trick for anyone with an American Express Platinum, Gold or Green card. Whilst this is not described anywhere on the Amex website, you can buy up to 10,000 Membership Rewards points per year for 1.5p each. These can be transferred across to Avios at 1:1 so you effectively buy Avios for 1.5p each.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'For relatively modest quantities, this is a far cheaper option than buying directly. The only downside is that it will take a few days for Amex to transfer the points across to Avios.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even better, shop through TopCashback and you can swap your cashback like for like into Avios, with a 5% bonus. So £5 per month would be worth £6,500 Avios in a year. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can earn cashback when shopping online simply by clicking through the site before you buy from the retailer as normal, and it's available on anything from switching your energy provider to shopping in M&amp;S or Argos. </p>                            </div>                        </div><img id="i-b72a7a1f029accbe" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/02/12/0CE4289A00000578-5835835-image-a-2_1530529847793.jpg" height="408" width="306" alt="Sparkling idea? Avoid using your Avios to buy wine or champagne, it offers much worse value compared to flights" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Is it good value to reserve a seat using Avios or buy wine?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">British Airways Executive Club lets you use your Avios to pay for other things such as wine, hotel bookings, seat reservations and car rental. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These tend not to offer great value, around 0.55p off per point exchanged according to Burgess.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here's a couple of examples.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">Seat reservations </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The prices depend on the seat you are reserving but when we checked the cost of reserving seats for a return flight to Florence, it cost £21 per seat or 7,650 for a couple one way. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That works out at 0.55p. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">Wine </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When we checked out the options for buying wine with Avios points, it was offering a case of 12 bottles for between 16,000 and 22,500 Avios. These are all selections of different wines which made them hard to compare the price. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However to give you an idea of the value it sells a bottle of Dom Perignon for 22,900 - the cheapest price for the same vintage online is £120. That's a value of 0.52p per Avios.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">Hotel </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Similarly when This is Money looked at hotels in Paris for three nights six months in advance we found a five-star hotel costs 144,500 Avios - online you could book the same hotel on the same nights through Booking.com £792.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That's 0.55p per Avios.  </p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>There have been several revisions to the Avios scheme over the years, unsurprisingly all meaning your points don’t get you quite as much or they are harder to earn.

But when I informed Calor Gas I was quitting it agreed to match Flogas’s price.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">John stood firm until Calor Gas came back again with a £250 refund if he agreed to sign for two more years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">John, author of book Low Cost Living, adds: ‘Now when a two-year deal comes to an end I simply call competitors and go with who can offer the best price after telling them about other deals that are on the table.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There is no hard-nosed haggling – I just say I will go elsewhere. By switching I have saved £1,000 over two years.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The couple ran out of gas at the start of the year – despite an automatic call to the fuel supplier from a sensor attached to his gas tank. When John called to explain his wife needed heating as she suffers from a lung condition, the supplier Calor Gas was quick to respond – and came the next day.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not all gas customers have been so fortunate. A bottle neck in supply has been caused by a combination of factors. These include a rise in demand, a broken North Sea gas pipeline and refineries closed for maintenance work including Stanlow in Cheshire and Valero in Pembrokeshire.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some customers have been left waiting up to six weeks for deliveries – during which time many ran out of gas. The delays began in January and are still being experienced.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bulk orders can lower costs but when an order is made makes little difference – unlike other fuels such as oil. Those ordering in low demand times such as summer should at least not suffer long delays. Rose also says that some homeowners struggle to escape the clutches of a rip-off deal after their two-year contract is over due to the gas tank being within three metres of a building or tree.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to ‘code of conduct’ rules it means a competitor may not be willing to take the deal on, so you are effectively tied to the existing supplier. But this should not stop customers trawling the market for a better price and demanding to pay a lower tariff.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Competition Commission made a ruling in 2009 stating that suppliers are obliged to transfer storage tank ownership to a new provider when they switch – usually after at least two years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The commission, which was renamed the Competition and Markets Authority in 2014, also demanded that suppliers make it more clear to customers they can switch after the end of their two-year lock-in period.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesperson for the industry trade body UKLPG says: ‘The LPG market in Britain is highly competitive with more than 30 companies supplying gas. Consumers looking for a supplier can use the postcode search service on our website to find regional and national companies serving their area.’</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Haggle to get the best price on your two-year fuel contract</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ignore logo on the gas container</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gas tanks installed by suppliers such as Calor Gas or Flogas, have a logo on the side of the container. But this does not mean you cannot switch to another provider. The gas will be exactly the same.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sign up to the right two-year deal</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All suppliers make you sign for two years to justify the cost of taking over your storage tank. National and regional suppliers are listed at uklpg.org. Check out deals at lpgcompare.co.uk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Plan ahead for prompt delivery</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Customers are waiting up to six weeks for gas this spring due to high demand. Summer orders avoid this delay. Bulk-buy for the best price. Charges are often fixed so will not widely fluctuate over the year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Tell a supplier you wish to quit</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gas suppliers rely on loyalty to make money. Tell them you are going to a competitor when a contract ends. They may well match a deal found elsewhere.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Haggle for an even better deal</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Do not stop with a lower offer from a competitor. Play poker with suppliers by allowing them to fight it out for your custom.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-95d1c3c0-4bbb-11e8-83f9-b72299fe4dc0">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">What you need to know each week: The This is Money podcast </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Want to know the most important things you need to know about money each week, what has caught our interest and what made us laugh?

Up to a million properties rely on liquid petroleum gas (LPG) for their heating as they are unable to hook up to the national gas grid. Lorries deliver the gas to put in home tanks. John Harrison, 63, from Clogwyn Melyn in North Wales, says when a two-year deal comes to an end he calls competitors and goes with who can offer the best price, after telling them about rival deals that are on the table.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>The Mail On Sunday</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Toby Walne for The Mail on Sunday</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-05-10T13:34:36.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Are you being held to ransom by suppliers over the price of LPG? </mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-05-10T13:34:36.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/bills/article-5588983/From-loft-insulation-log-fire-save-hundreds-pounds.html" title="'I gave beastly energy bills the chop': From loft insulation to a log fire, these six tips could save you hundreds of pounds"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/bills/article-3996950/Fed-rising-energy-bills-try-bright-ideas.html" title="'My woodburner warms my home...and my heart': Fed up with rising energy bills?

This isn't true. Some plans, for example, will not cover the cost of a limousine for family members, or restrict when you can have a funeral service.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some 'comparison' websites had the same director as the funeral plan product they recommended to the mystery shoppers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, John Murtagh is listed as director for comparison site Latelifeplanning, and also for the Prosperous Life funeral plans that website recommended.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One website, Gocomparefuneral plans.com, uses green lettering similar to the GoCompare.com site known for its TV adverts, even though the two are not linked.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Graeme McAusland, chief executive of the Funeral Planning Authority, says: 'The poor behaviour and malpractice which is negatively impacting customers comes from a small number of providers not registered with us.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Safe Hands says it 'unreservedly and entirely condemns any high-pressure selling practices by anyone promoting its funeral plans'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A legal representative of Capital Life says: 'Our client is most concerned to ensure representatives engaged to sell its funeral plans operate within the company's guidelines.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The popular  Avios airline points scheme has confirmed it will close this summer, affecting around 2.4 million customers who use the programme to clock up  frequent flyer rewards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The good news is that all existing customers will be moved to British Airways' Executive Club instead, which already uses the Avios currency.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This means there will be no changes to the value of your points, and customers will still be able to clock up reward points on flights, on credit cards attached to the Avios scheme and by swapping their Tesco Clubcard points.</p><img id="i-af6493f0091ce120" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/09/12/4AFAF3AD00000578-5594009-What_s_changing_Avios_customers_will_have_more_choice_of_airline-a-20_1523271858020.jpg" height="376" width="634" alt="Avios customers will have more choice of airlines under the BA Executive Club" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are a few differences between the schemes however.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To help you get to grips with how switching could affect you, here's everything you need to know about the changes, what they mean for your points pot and whether you could in fact end up better off.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"> British Airways vs Avios: What's the difference?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Avios scheme and BA Executive Club systems can be a little confusing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The easiest way to understand it is to look at Avios as a currency. British Airways Executive Club and Avios use the same points system, but these are collected into separate pots. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most frequent flyers with the airline will likely already be part of the BA Executive Club as it offers extra perks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But both schemes offer loyalty points on BA flights and other partners including on hotels, shopping, car hire, insurance and travel money and each has airline rewards credit cards attached to it.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They both also let you spend the points on things other than flights, such as wine and spirits, activities such as spa days and theme park days.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the past the Avios Travel Rewards scheme also offered redemption with other airlines including Monarch, Flybe and Air Malta. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Currently the BA Executive Club has a few extra airline partnerships  that allow you to spend points  (see below).</p><div>

Their points are safe and will be transferred over to British Airways Executive Club.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What is not being discussed, however, is that this represents an admission of failure by Avios to build a stand-alone multi-partner loyalty scheme in the UK. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The plan, launched back in 2011, was to turn Avios into a 'coalition' loyalty scheme along the lines of Nectar. They have not succeeded.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is not really the fault of Avios. The main selling point was the opportunity to redeem points for flights. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">British Airways remains a London-centric airline with very little to offer Avios collectors outside the M25. When Monarch went bust, Avios collectors in the regions lost the opportunity to redeem with them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Flybe remains a partner but it has a patchy and ever-changing route network and Avios redemptions with them are poor value anyway.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With Tesco reducing the role of Clubcard - which was a major driver of Avios, as Clubcard points can be transferred over - and the <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/cardsloans/article-5121201/Is-death-airline-credit-card-horizon.html">closure of the Lloyds Avios Rewards credit cards</a> to new applicants following the caps on the fees card companies can charge shops, Avios was likely to struggle to grow going forward.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By returning it to its original Air Miles roots as a frequent flyer programme first and foremost it can consolidate its strongest relationship as the reward scheme for British Airways passengers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong></p></div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">What happens next?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Customers will receive letters from Avios in the coming weeks with the full details.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This summer they will be able to choose to open a  British Airways Executive Avios account to transfer their Avios points into.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once you have an account you will need to activate it online before you can spend your points.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have more than one Avios pot you can combine your accounts before your points are moved by contacting customer services.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have a BA account already you can move your Avios pot to this instead.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The bullying tactics include:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today, we reveal the reasons firms are using these dirty tricks — and lay out our key demands, which should put an end to them once and for all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Crucially, all the major energy suppliers — British Gas, E.ON, SSE, ScottishPower, npower and EDF Energy — are under enormous pressure to install 50 million smart meters in UK homes and businesses by the end of 2020. But with two-and-a-half years to go, they can so far tick off only 11 million.</p><img id="i-e5e460d1ebf70c1b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/10/22/04E40A44000005DC-5600925-image-a-11_1523396276500.jpg" height="405" width="634" alt="Smart meters show how much power and gas you're using minute by minute and send that data to your supplier" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">That means firms must fit 24 smart meters every minute between now and the deadline. If they fail to meet the target, power firms face swingeing fines equal to 10 per cent of their worldwide sales. In the worst cases, the penalties could exceed £7 billion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Suppliers have been ordered by the Government to take 'all reasonable steps' to ensure every home has a smart meter fitted by the end of 2020. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But firms say they have been issued no guidance on what 'all reasonable steps' means in practice. As a result, the Big Six privately admit they push the boundaries as far as they can.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The threat of such a huge fine is like a Sword of Damocles hanging over us,' says a source at one major supplier. 'When we've asked what 'all reasonable steps' means, the answer has been: 'We'll tell you if you've done enough after the deadline.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We're taking the view that the only way to prove we've done enough — and avoid the fine — is to have meters actually installed in homes rather than just asking customers if they want one.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Money Mail's Stop The Smart Meter Bullying campaign calls on the Government to relax its targets for the roll-out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ministers could either push back the 2020 deadline or reduce the number of homes in which they need to fit meters. For example, they could say suppliers must install them in only 80 per cent of homes and businesses by this time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Privately, energy firms say this would reduce the need for bullying tactics as they could more carefully target the customers who they think would be interested.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Money Mail revealed in February that suppliers estimated the cost of fitting the meters across the country had ballooned from £11 billion to more than £20 billion. </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">This cost goes on customers' bills so could wipe out the benefits from the energy savings they were promised they would make from seeing up-to-date usage figures and receiving accurate monthly charges.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Money Mail understands some firms are concerned that if they are forced to install smart meters too quickly, the fitters they employ could start to cut corners. If the technology is installed poorly, it could put families at risk of fires or an explosion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The second part of Money Mail's campaign calls on the energy regulator to set out clear rules on what is and what is not an acceptable way to advertise the devices to customers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Companies should have to state clearly — in large print on letters, emails, texts and during phone calls — that installing a smart meter is optional and that customers have the right to say no.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ofgem must also prevent companies setting up installation appointments for customers who have not requested them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The watchdog should ban firms from reserving their best energy prices for customers who have smart meters and should crack down on the use of incentives to persuade people to sign up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Smart meters help customers save money,' says Energy Minister Claire Perry. 'That is why we are we committed to ensuring that all consumers are offered the chance to upgrade by the end of 2020.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Suppliers must treat customers fairly in how they communicate with them and we expect regulator Ofgem to ensure they do.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An Energy UK spokesman says: 'Companies have trialled different approaches and we're working with suppliers on good-practice principles for the smart meter roll-out.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman for Ofgem says: 'It is not compulsory to have a smart meter installed — consumers have a right to decline them and suppliers must not mislead consumers.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Supplier booked a fitting without my permission — I was furious: </strong><span class="mol-style-larger"><strong>Kathy, 65, is one of thousands </strong></span><span class="mol-style-larger"><strong>hounded by energy firms that </strong></span><span class="mol-style-larger"><strong>won't take no for an answer</strong></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> By: SARA SMYTH </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Almost seven months have passed since Money Mail first reported on energy suppliers bullying customers into getting smart meters — and readers say the intimidation tactics are only getting dirtier.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Every week, we receive dozens of complaints from customers who've been bombarded with calls, texts and letters that make it seem like they must get the new technology fitted immediately.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some have discovered that this is not true and have written back to their suppliers, pleading for the junk mail to stop. Yet the barrage rarely ceases.</p><img id="i-5934f3071649851d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/10/22/4AFBB4A500000578-5600925-image-a-12_1523397042294.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Angry: Kathy Relf struggled to contain her outrage when Npower emailed her saying an appointment had been booked for a smart meter to be fitted when she hadn't asked for one" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anne Dagen, from Stanwick, Northamptonshire, says she's hit by a wave of anger each time a letter arrives from her supplier, E.on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The letters she and other customers have received are some of the most aggressive Money Mail has seen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some state, in bold, red lettering, that 'your meters are being phased out' and 'we need to change your meter'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Readers say they were left with the impression that the changeover was a foregone conclusion — even though they have the right to refuse.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In July last year, Anne was receiving roughly one of these types of letters every month. She complained about being harassed and was offered a derisory £10 compensation.</p><img id="i-b42722d102b1b1e7" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/11/11/4B0AEBB900000578-5600925-image-m-4_1523442752419.jpg" height="370" width="634" alt="Foregone conclusion? Replica of a letter sent out by Eon suggesting that old models of meters are being phased out" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">E.on promised that her complaint would be logged on her account and Anne would not hear about an installation for the 'foreseeable future'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, just six months later, the letters started arriving again. In January, E.on wrote saying Anne needed to upgrade to the new equipment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then, in March, an email arrived saying: 'You recently told us you were interested in being one of the first to have a brand new smart meter.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anne says she never told E.on anything of the sort. 'It's so frustrating that the whole cycle has begun again,' she says. 'It's as if they've wiped my records and are ignoring the fact I have made two official complaints.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anne refused the £10 compensation, saying it in no way reflects the annoyance she has been caused.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman for E.on apologised for not removing Anne from its mailing list when she asked.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last October, E.on promised to tone down the language it uses when it contacts customers about smart meters, after Money Mail reported the firm to Ofgem.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the time, its correspondences said: 'It's a legal requirement and we want to keep you safe. When we replace it, we're going to give you a free self-reading meter.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the evidence shows that the firm has continued with its bullish tactics.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We have seen letters dated February 2018 that state: 'Your electricity meter is an old model that we need to replace with our free self-reading smart meter. We need to install smart meters in our customer's homes as part of a nationwide upgrade programme.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">John, 78, from Hertfordshire, received one of these letters from E.on last September.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He wrote an impassioned reply, telling E.on to stop pestering him — but was then contacted four times in one month. Last month, he received two letters and two phone calls from the firm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An E.on spokesman apologised and the firm has now removed John from its mailing list.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Money Mail has heard several accounts of companies leading customers to believe that they could be charged for smart meter installations if they don't agree to one now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One customer, who does not want to be named, says: 'It's presented like a ticking time bomb. It certainly sounds like you will end up with one, whether you want it or not.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This customer is with Utility Warehouse, but the firm says it has no record of ever giving customers any information that would suggest they have to pay for a smart meter.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">All suppliers have slightly different ways of trying to convince their customers to sign up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">First Utility has offered £50 Amazon vouchers to customers who agree to have a smart meter fitted within the next month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Scottish Power has sent emails asking customers: 'Did you know your current gas and electricity meters are being phased out and replaced with smart meters?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">SSE writes to customers with traditional meters that are 'nearing the end of their lifespan'. It then offers smart meters as replacements. EDF letters say: 'Important — book your smart meter change now'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last year, we caught firms booking smart meter installation appointments for customers — even though they hadn't requested one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The evidence you've sent to our postbag shows this practice is continuing — at an alarming rate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kathy Relf, 65, struggled to contain her outrage when Npower emailed her saying an appointment had been booked for a smart meter to be fitted when she hadn't asked for one and does not want a new meter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The email, seen by Money Mail, states: 'Your new smart meters are coming. Confirm your Npower smart meter appointment.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The retired radio producer was told she had an appointment in two weeks' time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The email continues: 'We'd like to come and fit your smart meters but can only guarantee we'll be able to fit them if you confirm this date or choose a new one within the next five days.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kathy cancelled the appointment and asked for no further communication from Npower about dual fuel smart meters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She says: 'I'd never heard of being given an appointment that I hadn't asked for.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's a bit rich because when you do want something sorted, it's almost impossible to get an appointment with Npower.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman for Npower says that offering appointments in this way is in line with the Smart Metering Installation Code of Practice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In January, the Mail reported that energy giants had been accused of flouting trading laws by pressuring homeowners into getting smart meters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some firms were making it sound like a legal requirement to replace your meter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trading Standards chiefs told power firms giving customers this impression breached consumer law.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Chartered Trading Standards Institute wrote to Energy UK, which represents big suppliers, to raise concerns about the way that firms are marketing the meters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet Money Mail readers say their suppliers, under huge pressure to keep rolling out smart meters, are still using hard-sell ploys.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">George McClure, 70, will lose £144 a year if he doesn't sign up for a smart meter with his current provider. The retired headmaster and his wife Maureen, also 70, have paid £90 a month for dual fuel with First Utility for the past five years.</p><img id="i-9dfef771be35be77" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/10/22/2A475EC200000578-5600925-image-a-16_1523397522587.jpg" height="260" width="634" alt="Money Mail readers say their suppliers, under huge pressure to keep rolling out smart meters, are still using hard-sell ploys" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">They were told their current tariff will change to £98 if they renew next month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But this deal is only valid if a smart meter is installed. Without a smart meter, the best deal the couple can get is £110 a month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">George doesn't want one, but also doesn't want to overspend on his energy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says: 'It's an underhand way to force my hand, but I refuse to have a device in my home that undermines my privacy.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman for First Utility says the firm makes clear when a customer signs up that the tariff they're offered is dependent on having a smart meter installed within six months.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Saverio D'Amico, 67, says he felt tricked into accepting a smart meter after he was sent a seemingly innocuous letter claiming his analogue electricity meter had reached the end of its lifespan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The retired engineer from Peterborough followed the letter's instructions to telephone E.on to arrange a like-for-like replacement. Instead, he was greeted by a smart meter adviser who thanked him for requesting the new technology.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Saverio says: 'I felt duped — like they'd used mind tricks to reel me in. I was a bit flustered throughout the phone call and the adviser just kept talking over me. So, in the end, I accepted it and had the meter installed.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Saverio was unaware that sticking with an analogue meter was an option for him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman for E.on says that Saverio didn't contact the firm to say he didn't want a smart meter. It said it was in the process of updating its letters and emails to make it clearer that smart meters are not compulsory.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The spokeman adds: 'We're obliged to contact our customers about upgrading their smart meters as part of our commitment to Ofgem.' A spokesman for Energy UK says: 'The energy industry has installed more than 11 million smart meters in the UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Customers have reported high levels of satisfaction overall for both the smart meter itself (80 per cent) and the installation visit (89 per cent).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Energy companies are working hard to enable as many people as possible to experience the benefits that smart meters bring and to ensure the rollout is carried out safely, efficiently and cost-effectively.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Suppliers remain committed to meeting the Government's deadline of ensuring all households and businesses are offered a smart meter by 2020.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">s.smyth@dailymail.co.uk<span class="mol-style-larger"><strong> </strong></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-larger"><strong>How I </strong></span><span class="mol-style-larger"><strong>fought the </strong></span><span class="mol-style-larger"><strong>bullies and </strong></span><span class="mol-style-larger"><strong>won £50</strong></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By: GUY ADAMS</p><img id="i-46c55c9d061b540f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/11/09/16E0FF2D000005DC-5600925-Smart_move_Feature_writer_Guy_Adams_took_on_First_Utility_and_wo-a-2_1523436385237.jpg" height="451" width="306" alt="Smart move: Feature writer Guy Adams took on First Utility and won £50" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last autumn, a new type of junk mail began to appear among the pizza menus and charity begging letters on the doormat of my West London flat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sent in official-looking envelopes, they came from my gas and electricity supplier, First Utility. Each instructed me to 'upgrade to a smart meter' in order to 'get your gas and electricity bills under control'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As far as I'm concerned, my gas and electricity bills are already 'under control'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And I've no desire to take a day off so workmen can fit a vaguely Orwellian device that will almost certainly become useless when I switch supplier.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The letters were consigned swiftly to the bin. Various similar emails met the same fate, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nevertheless, the marketing blitz continued.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One day in mid-October, things took an more intrusive turn, when lunch was interrupted by the ping of a text message. It was 'just a friendly reminder from First Utility to call our partner Siemens (on an 0345 number) to arrange your smart meter installation'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Irritated by this increasingly high-pressure campaign, I wrote to the energy company, formally asking it to stop contacting me about smart meters. A simple request, one might think. But it was not to be.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In response, First Utility claimed that it would take me off its own 'smart meter mailing list'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet, somewhat bizarrely, it added that this wouldn't actually prevent new text messages from arriving.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These had, apparently, been sent by Siemens, a German technology firm it had hired, as a sub-contractor, to install the devices.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To prevent this other firm from continuing to bother me, I was blithely advised to 'contact them directly'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are several problems with this response — not least that I'd no contractual relationship with Siemens and no memory of agreeing to have my personal phone number shared with it, or anyone else.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I therefore asked First Utility to explain why it had passed it on and when, if ever, I'd consented.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its response?

<h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">The experts' top picks </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Peter Sleep, senior investment manager at Seven Investment Management</strong>, said investors should always aim put their cash in regulated 'UCITS' funds - which have stringent safeguards for investors in place. He outlined his top picks below.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>UK Equity - </strong></strong><strong><strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="https://www.lyxoretf.lu/en/instit/resources/documents/factsheets/rfact_lu1781541096_en_20180309_lux">Lyxor Core Morningstar UK ETF</a></strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><strong>Ongoing charges: 0.04 per cent</strong><strong></strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Lyxor Core Morningstar UK ETF is a new fund which  launched this month. It costs 0.04 per cent, which is as cheap as chips.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A broad-based UK equity fund is the core building block for any investor. The ETF has 337 stocks and  a good combination of large international companies and smaller UK-orientated companies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>UK Equity Income - </strong></strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://webfund6.financialexpress.net/clients/dailymail/FundFactsheet.aspx?CitiCode=FPC7"><strong><strong>Vanguard UK Equity Income</strong></strong></a></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ongoing charges: 0.22 per cent</strong></p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I'm a fan of the Vanguard UK Equity Income Fund priced at 0.22 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is a tracker fund rather than an ETF, although they are very, very similar. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some caution is needed with UK equity income funds because you can end up biased towards quite volatile stocks. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Vanguard fund is nicely balanced and has a decent yield of about 4.9 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Global Equity - <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://webfund6.financialexpress.net/clients/dailymail/FundFactsheet.aspx?CitiCode=K41J">Vanguard Global Small-Cap Index</a></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ongoing charges: 0.40 per cent</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Again another tracker fund from Vanguard. The Global Small-cap Index fund priced at 0.38 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This invests in over 4,300 smaller companies from around the developed world. Historically smaller companies grow faster and show better returns than larger companies that may often have grown to their limit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ethical ETF - </strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://webfund6.financialexpress.net/clients/dailymail/FundFactsheet.aspx?CitiCode=OCQH"><strong><strong>UBS ETF MSCI ACWI Socially Responsible UCITS ETF</strong></strong></a></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ongoing charges: 0.48 per cent</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is an increasing number of ethical ETFs, but I am going to go for UBS ETF MSCI ACWI Socially Responsible UCITS ETF. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is an 'all countries' ETF, so it covers both 47 developed markets and emerging markets, but not frontier markets (defined as smaller illiquid stock markets where investor protections are poor). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This ETF scores every company on various ethical, social and governance standards and then kicks out sectors with a negative social or environmental impact like gambling or alcohol. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ETF costs 0.48 per cent. To reduce the risk of investing abroad this ETF is hedged into sterling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Bond ETF: </strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPFB:GR"><strong><strong>SPDR Barclays Global Aggregate Bond UCITS ETF</strong></strong></a></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ongoing charges: 0.10 per cent</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The SPDR Barclays Global Aggregate Bond UCITS ETF  GBP hedged costs 0.1 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the long-term, the king of investments is equities, but we know they can be very volatile and they are not for everyone, so more cautious investors hold bonds and accept a lower return for a less bumpy investment ride.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This ETF invests in high grade government and corporate bonds, what we call 'supranationals', like the World Bank, and high-grade emerging market bonds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finally it is all hedged into  sterling to reduce risk further.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You get all that for the bargain basement price of 0.1 per cent. With 21,000 bonds in the index the ETF is highly diversified and SPDR have to work really hard for you.</p><div class="moduleFull"><div class="money item">

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is also worth thinking about how engaged you want to be.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Do you want to cherry-pick shares yourself, or do you want a professional fund manager to do it for you? Alternatively, you may prefer to sign up to an online investment service, typically called a robo-adviser, that assesses your risk and chooses an investment portfolio for you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In addition, don't forget about the price tag your investments come with. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Passive investments - those that simply track a given index like the FTSE 100 - are generally cheaper than actively-managed funds, where a manager aims to beat the market benchmark.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You should also aim to avoid fads. Jumping on a bandwagon because you think you will make quick money is not an investment it is a gamble. That can be lucrative or go wrong swiftly, as the halving in the price of bitcoin from almost $20,000 before Christmas to around $10,000 now has shown.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, while it might be tempting to jump on the bandwagon and invest in Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and other crytocurrencies tipped by your taxi driver to deliver eye-watering returns, remember that's not investing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With this in mind, we've asked an expert in the field of consumer investing to provide some guidance to help you on your way.  <strong></strong></p><img id="i-d1a9e30932d107d2" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/27/09/499FD40100000578-5436479-Holly_MacKay_of_Boring_Money_says_the_first_thing_to_think_about-a-4_1519724992779.jpg" height="415" width="306" alt="Holly MacKay of Boring Money says the first thing to think about is how long you wish to invest for" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Holly MacKay, chief executive of Boring Money, replies:</strong> The first question we have to ask is 'How long?' As a rule of thumb if you’re looking to shares, you should be able to set this money aside for at least 5 years. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why? To avoid being a forced seller. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the first week of February this year, global stockmarkets had a mini-meltdown although they have since made up some of the lost ground. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To take our example to its extreme, if you had invested for a week, you would have lost up to about 7 per cent.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-96aabea0-1d58-11e8-b9e9-d55960be974c">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox">If you’re investing for the very long-term you may want to only choose shares </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pushing these timeframes out, if you invest in shares for only a year, it is perfectly normal to witness ups and downs which could see you lose out. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Think back to 2008 for example when we saw the financial crisis. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The longer you invest for, the higher the odds that the stock market will do better than cash. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A well-respected survey by Barclays reported that over any 10-year period since stock markets began, you are 90 per cent more likely to have done better in shares than in cash.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">What should you invest in? </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The second question is What should I invest in? The key word here is invest not gamble. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’ve lost count of people asking me about cryptocurrencies over the last 6 months. Bitcoin fell from $9,500 to $6,000 within a week in early February and is now on the rise again. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s risky stuff which very few people understand. I have no doubt that blockchain and cryptocurrencies will be mainstream, but bitcoin is just one ‘flavour’ and feels overdone to me. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some 80 per cent of all bitcoin are held by less than 1,000 accounts. Shady stuff and not the basis of a new financial system!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back to the more tangible world of the stock market and behind all the boring jargon and waffle from investment firms, investing in shares is simply investing in human endeavour and initiative.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For most that involves hitching your fortunes to those of the world’s largest companies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Buying into a actively-managed ‘fund’ is like buying a ready-made basket of shares, picked and blended by a professional. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A global shares fund could see you own a bit of Microsoft, Amazon, Heineken, Samsung and other giant brands. It’s no more complicated than Dragon’s Den – fund managers try and pick companies which they think will grow, make money and turn decent profits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shares are the most volatile type of mainstream investment and can jump up and down in value a lot. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bonds (basically IOUs from Governments and companies which pay investors some income for their loans) are typically the more bland investment cousin and can be used by investors to turn the rollercoaster into a more sedate ride.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’re investing for the very long-term you may want to only choose shares. If you want to smooth out the peaks and trough, you will want to use some bonds as well and for this, a so-called ‘multi-asset’ fund is your easiest option to investigate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/investing/article-4367938/50-best-funds-investment-trusts.html">&gt; Essential reading: 50 of the best funds and investment trusts </a></p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">How much could you make? </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your third question is probably going to be about numbers. How much could I make? And how much could I lose?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a very loose rule of thumb I think you are doing well if a balanced portfolio of shares makes you about 5 per cent a year after fees. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s very hard to give these guides, as some years it could be 20 per cent and other years minus 20 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Riskier smaller companies, or certain less developed markets can offer the potential better returns but with a large potential risk of loss. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And what about a mixed bag of British names? Well the FTSE 100 fell by nearly 30 per cent in 2008 but made the vast majority of this back in 2009. So you need to be prepared for these bad years which will come (hopefully infrequently but they are an occasional fact of investing life). </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-7a593950-1d5a-11e8-9b71-4778c817f52d">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Get a free guide to investing </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">How to be a successful investor is This is Money's easy to understand and jargon-free guide to the world of investing. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The guide is written by This is Money editor Simon Lambert, who writes a regular Minor Investor column and presents <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/money/investingshow/index.html">The Investing Show</a>.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/diyinvesting/article-4339358/How-successful-investor-free-guide-investing.html">download it here</a> or by clicking on the button above.</p></div>                        </div><img id="i-3292e5984724af3d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/27/10/49A03C6600000578-5436479-image-a-8_1519728357331.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="There are a plethora of DIY platforms as well as robo-advisers that facilitates investments but they don't all do the same things" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">What are the best options? </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finally the last question might be, Sounds great Einstein, but how do I actually do this?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At this stage your choices are typically:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A) I have no idea so please can someone just do it all for me.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Buying your home as a long-term investment is not necessarily the best bet you can make, as many believe, with stocks offering far better returns over the long term according to research from global bank Credit Suisse.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a study of data stretching back 118 years, researchers found that despite the widely held belief that property offers the best and most reliable returns, the housing sector globally has actually returned a 'quality-adjusted real capital gain' of approximately –2.1 per cent per year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By this measure stock markets beat the likes of property, bonds and cash hands down through the years.</p><img id="i-e01b7cffed96755f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/23/10/494733C100000578-0-image-a-2_1519380074535.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Not so safe as houses: Property across the world returned a loss of 2 per cent a year according to the Credit Suisse report" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The quality-adjusted real capital gain measurement used in the report produces return figures with the impact of inflation and variation in housing quality accounted for, and can produce very different results from a flat measure of returns.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 'Global Investment Yearbook 2018', was produced by the Credit Suisse Research Institute with authors from the London Business School and aims to provide an in-depth and long-term look at investment returns.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the UK, between 1900 and 2017, investing in the stock market would have netted an annualised return of 5.5 per cent while house prices saw increases of 1.8 per cent a year. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">UK bonds returned 1.8 per cent and 'bills' - essentially cash - returned 1 per cent a year. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To push home its point, the team reveal that in the US house prices fell by more than 36 per cent in real terms between 2005 and 2012.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The stock market returns do include reinvested dividends, but the house price gains do not account for any potential returns from property rental income making it hard to judge how returns from a buy-to-let property could differ.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Including rental income in the calculations would be difficult, the authors say, due to the lack of reliable data stretching back 100 years and the 'impossible' task of then matching potential rental income with the properties included in the pricing index. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Overall, the report insists residential property would not offer premium returns in the long term. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Residential property should not be purchased with an exaggerated expectation of a large risk premium. It is equity assets that provide an expected reward for risk. The real case for equities is that, over the long term, stockholders have enjoyed a large equity risk premium,' the report said. </p><img id="i-8da0e8c828e9d233" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/23/10/1D2469A700000578-5426101-Collectable_and_rare_wines_offered_returns_of_3_7_per_cent_a_yea-a-6_1519380672886.jpg" height="412" width="306" alt="Collectable and rare wines offered returns of 3.7 per cent a year since the turn of the twentieth century" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the US, investing in stocks produced annualised returns of 9.6 per cent a year between 1900 and 2017.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bonds returned 4.9 per cent on an annualised basis, bills 3.7 per cent and inflation averaged at 2.9 per cent a year over the same period.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was reflected around the world, with equity returns since 1900 coming at between 3 and 6 per cent in every location the authors examined.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Equities were the best-performing asset class everywhere,' the report said, while bonds beat bills in every country except Portugal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This overall pattern, of equities beating bonds and bonds beating bills, is precisely what we would expect over the long haul, since equities are riskier than bonds, while bonds are riskier than cash,' it added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With volatility returning to global markets after a prolonged period of calm, Credit Suisse research institute's Richard Kersley said the report was of 'heightened relevance' to understand where the best returns come from.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Traditionally viewed as 'safe' assets, precious metals such as gold, silver and diamonds were found to be less of haven than many think and did not offer good protection against inflation with the metals producing a lower return than US treasury bills over the long term.</p><img id="i-e6f568b36710ca92" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/23/12/4984080700000578-5426101-image-a-3_1519388994501.jpg" height="481" width="634" alt="UHNWI (Ultra High Net Worth Investors) have a quarter of all their wealth in financial assets" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-5784d1f659b6cb7d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/23/12/498407FB00000578-5426101-image-a-4_1519389059520.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="This chart shows stocks (blue bar) offered far higher returns in every country the study examined with bonds and bills even producing negative returns in Italy, Germany and Japan" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Away from the likes of stocks, bonds and gold, some investors may have punted on the fact a collection of fine wines or postage stamps may offer superior returns over the long-run.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The study found that out of the four collectible items with figures dating back to 1900 - wine, art, stamps and violins – wine performed best with prices appreciating 3.7 per cent a year. Art performed the worst since 1900 with prices rising just 1.9 per cent a year, more in line with the returns offered by global bonds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Again, equities outperformed any holdings of rare collectibles on a general basis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a world of rock bottom interest rates, the report's authors expect returns across all asset classes will likely remain lower in future.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When real interest rates are low, as they are today, subsequent returns tend to be lower,' the report said.</p><img id="i-390f952d47eb90d8" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/23/12/498407F400000578-5426101-image-a-5_1519389175773.jpg" height="475" width="634" alt="In these 11 countries, housing has increased in value by 1.3 per cent a year - far below the returns offered by equities over the same period - but can stock returns continue to beat cash and property in the future?" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The authors Professors Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh, and Dr Mike Staunton, predict the margin by which equities are likely to outperform cash in future will be lower than the 118-year historical premium of 4.3 per cent a year. Their long run forecast is 3.5 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, even with a lower future equity premium, equities are still expected to double relative to cash over a 20-year period</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The authors said: 'The importance of a long-term view when seeking to understand the nature of risk and return in the world's markets remains.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">You've raided your life savings to make your big idea a reality. Now it exists, you need the world to see it - and buy it. So how do you secure a big name stockist?  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is a question most entrepreneurs have to grapple with and there's no simple answer. Unfortunately, it's not as easy as Googling the right product buyer at the store you want to sell in and calling them - wouldn't that be great?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One entrepreneur who knows exactly how big a challenge it can be is Jonnie Matthew, co-founder and chief executive of sandal brand Solillas. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He, and his business partner and wife Sarahjayne, have succeeded in getting their product on to the shelves of some of the UK's most well-known retailers. Here he shares their experience and offers his top tips for emulating their success.</p><img id="i-9f0c518692381678" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/19/14/4851AE3900000578-5250841-image-a-2_1516372474766.jpg" height="469" width="634" alt="Partners: Husband and wife team Jonnie and Sarahjayne Matthew are selling a lot of sandals" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over the past seven years, Jonnie Matthew, 35, and his wife Sarahjayne, 34, have turned their start-up sandal business  into a popular fashion brand, stocked in Office,  Liberty, Selfridges, Topshop, House of Fraser and Schuh.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Such retailers now account for 90 per cent of their sales, which last year topped £1m in total. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since 2014 they have sold over 100k pairs of Menorcan-inspired sandals and they are now crowdfunding to raise just over £150,000 to grow their e-commerce platform, invest in digital marketing to capitalise on their most recent partnerships - especially in the US where they have secured Nordstrom as a stockist for 2018.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Breaking into the competitive and oversaturated fashion market was no easy feat,' says Jonnie, co-founder and chief executive. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When we started Solillas, Sarahjayne and I had no idea how it would pan out. We kept on our normal day jobs [in private equity for Jonnie and graphic design for Sarahjayne], working on the brand in the evenings and weekends. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'That way, we still had a regular income but could pursue our dream together.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'After a few years the business really started to take off, with some big orders from  big brands, such as Urban Outfitters and Office. It was only then that we both quit our jobs to run the business, and we’ve steadily grown in success ever since, winning a prestigious Best New Business title at Drapers Footwear Awards in 2015.'</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Why selling on the high street still matters</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It’s not easy getting into high street retailers. Buyers are bombarded with new products every day, so products need to really stand out,' says Jonnie. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But before you start chasing buyers, you have to think carefully about whether a high street retailer is the best way to take your business forward. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'E-commerce has opened up a whole new realm of possibilities that are especially useful to start-up brands due to the relative low cost of set up. It also gives you more control and a higher margin, helping you to grow sustainably.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'For many fashion brands, the answer will still be high street retail. Customers want to try on new products for fit and style, and it helps having a tangible product to reassure on quality.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'With Solillas, we actually took a dual approach. We knew that high street retail was where we wanted to be, but we first focused on building the brand on our own, through our website and social media.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The company has nearly more than 38,000 likes on Facebook, 10,000 followers on Instagram and 2,000 on Twitter.  </p><img id="i-d5eb42d3ce8d9b0" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/16/11/4830F69B00000578-5250841-image-a-2_1516103836564.jpg" height="530" width="634" alt="Socialising: The company developed its brand through social media to start with" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Seize opportunities to get your first big break</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">If good fortune comes your way, you need to seize it - but getting ahead also means making your own luck.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'After we’d built a good website and got a few initial sales to get us going, we advertised in some magazines and fashion websites,' says Jonnie.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Luckily, a buyer from Urban Outfitters saw our ad and bought a pair of our shoes for herself. She loved the unique design and quality of the shoes and emailed us an invite to come and pitch to her.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the pitch, Jonnie says they primarily focused on conveying their brand messages, which he says are a unique design story and quality production. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We explained how we’d been inspired by the traditional Menorcan sandal and went on to source the best quality materials to develop an update to the design.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a nutshell, that's exactly what the company does - designs shoes out of a studio in Kingston-upon-Thames in south-west London and manages the handmade manufacture of them in second-generation family factories in Spain. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We also told the buyers about our plans for the future – designs, fabrics, styles, and the direction we could take the business in. That got them excited.'</p><img id="i-d81d80aadab68408" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/09/15/47F290D100000578-5250841-image-a-3_1515511970256.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="On sale at Office: the fashionable Solillas sandal brand can be found alongside Birkenstock" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">What you need to tell the buyer in your pitch </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jonnie stresses the importance of including all of the practical information that a buyer will need to know during an effective sales pitch - which he lists as production and delivery capability; marketing and audience insights; and brand USPs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, there are lots of other questions retailers can and will ask. 'Typical retailer questions we were asked included: What are our best sellers? Do they tend to size larger, smaller, or stay true to size? How and where are they made? What does the packaging look like?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says that many of the retailers he has pitched to also wanted to know what other retailers the company was working with, or hoped to work with. It helps them align their own branding. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It’s important to have a good idea of who you would like to pitch to, even if you’ve not yet approached them,' advises Jonnie. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alternatively, if you are pitching to your first retailer, you can also think about whether you would offer that brand exclusivity, and whether that changes any other features of the deal, such as line runs and costs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We found that some retailers were particularly interested in our plans for the future. They wanted a long-term relationship with Solillas, but needed reassurance that we would have more products in the pipeline should the current range be successful. So, I would advise allowing yourself to daydream so you can go in with some great plans and ideas.'</p><img id="i-bbada0f64a2fc07e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/16/11/4830FA9B00000578-5250841-image-a-3_1516103990230.jpg" height="304" width="634" alt="Solillas sells direct from its own website as well as through major high street retailers" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Be prepared to act quickly </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Timing is also crucial, especially if you get that big order - but you also need to be honest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jonnie said: 'Once you’ve signed a successful deal, the process of getting into stores is likely to be fairly quick. Following our pitch to Urban Outfitters, we began production immediately and shipped our current surplus stock to their warehouses, ending up in stores within six months.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'After our first season in Urban Outfitters, we got a call from the buyer at Office, and produced and delivered the shoes in just four weeks. So, it really does depend on the retailer.'</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-68804200-fc62-11e7-81f0-d587e95053ac">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> After our first season in Urban Outfitters, we got a call from the buyer at Office, and produced and delivered the shoes in just four weeks</div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">He suggests that whatever timeframe they suggest, make sure you know your production and delivery capacity and never overstretch. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Retailers want good, solid, predictable relationships with their suppliers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If you promise an order you can’t deliver, you’ll not only lose out on a great opportunity, you’ll damage your reputation in what is a surprisingly small community of fashion buyers.'</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Nail your pricing </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Getting everything sorted includes working out pricing and margins. You need to price your products competitively, yet still allow yourself enough of a margin to grow healthily.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We based our price on industry standards and worked up from there, leaving ourselves plenty of headroom,' says Jonnie.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says you should also price in delivery costs. 'Retailers will expect products to be delivered on a specific date, packaged in a specific way – and that doesn’t come cheap. Do your research and go in armed with all this information.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You should also discuss any other costs the retailers may charge, such as photography and marketing contributions and factor those in as well. It’s often easier for buyers if they have a single cost for everything combined, rather than itemised or variable costs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Ultimately, you need to work closely with retailers so that they understand you, your business, and your product, and so that you understand what they need and want from the relationship.' </p><img id="i-964f171af675cfc" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/09/15/47F291C600000578-5250841-image-a-2_1515511966544.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Quality: Each pair is handmade at a second-generation family-run factory in Spain" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Build a strong relationship with the retailer</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Building a close relationship with a retailer brand can be a great source of support in a tough retail world.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">A new year signals the potential for a fresh start – and top of the list for many is ditching the current job and finding an exciting opportunity elsewhere.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps the current role has become stale, you don't like your boss or maybe it is time simply for a new challenge in 2018 - or a combination of all three.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Job seeking can be tough, especially when you already have a job. David Whitby, careers specialist at <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/index.htm">Glassdoor UK</a> has given us seven top tips to make sure your employment search doesn't become a second full-time stressful job.</p><img id="i-4b14646e89156e11" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/18/15/476E2CAB00000578-5190657-image-a-1_1513612459459.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Fresh challenge: Many will hunt for a new job as January begins - but it can be a daunting prospect when still employed" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">As part of This is Money's <span class="mol-style-italic">interview cheat sheet</span> series, David gives potential job seekers all the advice they need to help next year become the one in which you secure a new role.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says: 'The last thing you want to do when you get back from a long day at work is plonk down at your laptop to spend hours fine-tuning your CV, cranking out job applications and crafting tailored cover letters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Often, either your work performance suffers or your motivation to find a new position does.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'That's not even to mention the logistical nightmare of scheduling phone screens, in-person interviews and presentations when you work a full nine-to-five.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But finding a new job doesn't have to feel like a full-time job. With a few adjustments to your process and habits, it's entirely possible to avoid burnout - or getting caught by your current boss.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here are his tips:</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">1. TAP YOUR NETWORK</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">While it's not impossible to bag a job without a reference, it has been shown to increase the chances of a recruiter looking at your CV and, eventually, hiring you if you do.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When you first think about jumping ship, start networking and let your connections know you're interested in exploring new opportunities.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You may end up with a referral to a new position and not have to do much active job hunting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you don't directly know anyone at your dream company, though, don't despair — with the right message to the right contact, you can score an employee referral just by reaching out.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">2. DON'T SPRAY AND PRAY</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">A caveat to this last rule, though - you don't want to blast everybody you know with requests for informational interviews.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You'll want to do this carefully and selectively because you don't want word getting back to your current employer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On top of that, it's a time-consuming and ineffective tactic. Save time and mental energy by only applying to the top few companies that you think would be the best fit for your personality, work style and qualifications.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Get the inside track on work culture by checking out reviews at employment websites such as Glassdoor.</p><img id="i-1b4b66037b7bc51f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/18/15/476E2CB400000578-5190657-image-a-2_1513612462403.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Job search: David Whitby believes that job hunters should look for 30 minutes or an hour a day - or risk burn out" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">3. STICK TO A ROUTINE</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Speaking of time, be mindful of your own. It's easy to spend hours on end searching when you're looking forward to a new opportunity - or desperate to get out of your current situation - but even if it's exciting at first, you can quickly burn out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don't spend every waking hour looking for new employment. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rather, get your CV and LinkedIn profile up-to-date, then spend some time each day networking and actively looking for jobs to apply for.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dedicate a certain amount of time to your job search – even if it's 30 minutes or an hour a day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Signing up for job alerts will mean you get fresh  listings every day in your inbox, saving you time.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">4. BEWARE THE WORK COMPUTER</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">You might use your work laptop so much that it seems like an extra appendage by now, but you have to tread carefully when it comes to company-issued property.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even if you doubt that your company has the time and technology to monitor your usage, it's best to play it safe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don't use your work devices - computers, tablets, or phones - for job hunting. Be sure to use your personal e-mail address and store your documents on your personal devices or online.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One way to save job hunting time and avoid getting caught is to use job search apps on your personal phone.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">5. SCOPE OUT A BOLT HOLE</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are going to be applying for jobs then you never know when you might get a call from a recruiter on your mobile.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It can be difficult or awkward taking these calls at your desk, so scope out a quiet, private area somewhere that you can bolt to when a call does come in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remember to be confident and relaxed when you answer rather than furtive - it will create less suspicion among colleagues. Keep your tone light and breezy.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">6. PREPARE SOME GOOD EXCUSES</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your boss will notice if you suddenly start 'going to the dentist' (read: heading out to interviews) a couple of times a week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can cut down on the suspicion by taking off at more inconspicuous times, though.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It may be possible to schedule interviews early in the morning, at lunch time, or later in the day. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Try to use family members as an excuse rather than pretending to attend appointments or taking the car to the garage - managers are far less likely to feel comfortable probing about family issues.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These are of course options if you have no holiday to use - or cannot take last minute holiday days.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Resist the urge to immediately accept any invite the recruiter offers you and make sure it's a time that works for you — if they're truly interested, they won't mind a small wait (within reason).</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">7. TAKE YOUR WORK ENTHUSIASM UP A GEAR</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">It may seem a strange thing to do, but try to appear even more enthusiastic and satisfied at work than normal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are down about your current job, most people have trouble hiding it and give off an 'I've had enough' vibe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This can lead to unwanted attention and might mean you get caught out.

The exception would be if you have an old pension contract which had very specific rules about the age at which the pension could be taken.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As with all guidance that I give on pensions, you should always read the paperwork relating to your particular scheme and, if you are in any doubt, contact the scheme itself or your financial adviser if you have one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You could also talk to an adviser about which of the two pots to access first, as there may be a difference in the performance and charges associated with each one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are a couple of other things to think about when it comes to the timing of taking money from your private pension.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first is that when you took the pension out you may have been asked by the pension scheme when you planned to ‘retire’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You are not bound by this and there is no requirement on you to have stopped work before you access your pension. But if your plans have changed since you first took out your pension it is worth telling your pension company.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The reason for this is that some pension schemes will start to move your money into low-risk, low-return assets as you get near the ‘retirement age’ which they hold for you.</p><div class="moduleHalf"><div class="money item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Those of us of a certain age may remember a playground joke that went like this: when is a door not a door? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’ve never heard it or have forgotten the punchline, consider yourself lucky. It’s terrible. I won’t spoil it (too much). But here’s a clue: the modern equivalent of this 'joke' might be: when is a jar not a jar? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The answer: when it’s a sneaky trick dreamed up by product confusion consultancy Faecus and Rectavia to fool us now ex-customers into thinking we were getting a bargain. Boom boom.</p><img id="i-59cdc6c0dc693c41" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/01/14/46E0A8D600000578-0-image-a-1_1512139138374.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="Against the L'Or: one of these is an imposter. 165g is not a regulation size but was snuck on the shelf where the big jars usually go and made to look like the usual special offer." class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instant coffee comes in 100g or 200g jars. That's been the law since the first crop of Arabica beans was put through a clever sublimation process and freeze dried.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yeah I know that corner shops do little emergency-sized, hate-priced jar-ettes of Nescafé brown blend for people who wake up to an empty cupboard and can’t function without a fix.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But apart from that, 100 + 200 = the law. The law. Say it remember it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now enter Jacobs Douwe Egberts into the equation. </p><img id="i-f96bff76387a1919" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/01/14/46E0A8CA00000578-0-image-a-3_1512139497453.jpg" height="408" width="306" alt="Zut a L’Or. On closer inspection the big jar on the shelf at Morrisons was 165g and not the expected 200g." class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jacobs Douwe Egberts unsurprisingly owns the Douwe Egberts coffee brand. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It also owns Kenco and my beloved Carte Noire. At least it did until the 'gurus' at my imaginary marketing consultancy convinced the Egberts to change the name to the miserable looking apostrophic hell, L’Or, which is just a noise - like err, only French.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Literally L’Or means Gold. But we’ve already got a Gold Blend in the UK. Perhaps Nescafé will now change its Gold Blend to Black Card by way of linguistic revenge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To promote the new idiotic moniker, supermarkets took it in turns to offer 200g jars of L’Or at £4 each. Obviously, I immediately forgave the name change, stockpiled a six-month supply and peeled off the labels. Then went back for more. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Faecus and Rectavia had another plan to squeeze out: still do the £4 offer but sneak down the size of the jars to 165g. And I got taken in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No joke to end on - just a bitter aftertaste.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can still find jars of 200g on offer. Poundstretcher is knocking them out at a creditable £4.49. And I'm sure others will take their turn again. </p><img id="i-73e92db698850f34" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/01/17/46E2BC1600000578-5136751-image-a-1_1512151010506.jpg" height="364" width="634" alt="L'Or bore: there are genuine offers out there if you know where to look. " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shrinkflation is here to stay. It's already an established way for businesses to apparently avoid passing on the increasing costs of imported products to customers as our Brexit-battered currency shows little sign of recovery. The price stays the same, you get less stuff.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But this one feels a particularly cynical ploy considering that the size of instant coffee jars has been uniform for so long and the price of it has been happily fluctuating for just as long.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shop wisely. Tough times are in store.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><img id="i-9479dbdec63acc6d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/01/18/0035F0FF00000258-5136751-image-a-2_1512153190729.jpg" height="811" width="634" alt="Black Card: a coffee called desire. " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Oh all right.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Electric and petrol-electric hybrid car sales are racing away with 37 and 47 per cent more sold year-on-year respectively as of September.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is largely thanks to increased vehicle choice, falling prices and the news<a style="font-weight: bold;" class="" href="/money/cars/article-4731994/Diesel-petrol-ban-FAQs.html"> the sale of new petrol and diesel cars  in the UK</a> will be banned altogether by 2040.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While the overall number of electric cars on the road may still be small, several energy providers have responded to growing demand by launching electric vehicle (EV) tariffs.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Nissan Leaf - the UK's most popular model of electric car - has a range of 124 miles with one charge of its 24Kwh battery. Charging it up at home costs £3.30 on the Good Energy EV tariff.<strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The tariff itself would cost the average household with an electric car using 5,500kWh of electricity a year £849 - that's £167 more than the cheapest electricity-only tariff on the market from Powershop, which comes in at £682.</strong> <span class=""><strong> </strong></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Good Energy, which specialises in renewable energy, the tariff is designed for those who typically charge their car at home. According to its research, 80 per cent of EV drivers charge their cars at home or work.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To sign up you need to give your vehicle registration and as long as you drive an electric vehicle you are eligible for the deal. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Good Energy says all the electricity used is from 100 per cent 'renewables'. While the electricity you draw from the grid itself might not have come from a renewable source, what this means in practice is that the energy provider matches every unit of electricity you use with one generated by a green source, such as wind or solar.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class=""><strong></strong></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong></p><div class="money" id="mol-f941b340-ad9e-11e7-bfd6-df6c44fa7fad"> <table class="mol-table" data-swipe-article="false" width="100%"> <caption class="wocc">ELECTRIC VEHICLE ELECTRICITY TARIFFS</caption> <tbody>  <tr>   <th>Rank</th>    <th>Supplier</th>    <th>Tariff</th>    <th>Average Cost </th>    <th>Saving vs Typical Standard Bill after Price Rises*</th>    <th>Fixed or Variable</th>    <th>Fix Period</th>    <th>Cancellation Penalties</th>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>1</td>    <td>Good Energy</td>    <td>Electric Vehicle Tariff</td>    <td>£849</td>    <td>£112</td>    <td>Variable</td>    <td>n/a</td>    <td>n/a</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>2</td>    <td>OVO</td>    <td>EV Everywhere</td>    <td>£870</td>    <td>£92</td>    <td>Fixed</td>    <td>24 Months</td>    <td>£30</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>3</td>    <td>Ecotricity</td>    <td>Green Electricity</td>    <td>£987</td>    <td>-£26</td>    <td>Variable</td>    <td>n/a</td>    <td>n/a</td>   </tr><tr><td colspan="6">Source: energyhelpline.com, October 5, based on 5,500kWh electricity consumption</td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="8">* Saving calculated against an average bill of £962 (Average of Big 6 energy suppliers' Monthly Direct Debit payment method standard tariffs) after price rises enacted. </td></tr> </tbody> </table></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ecotricity</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.ecotricity.co.uk/for-your-home">Ecotricity</a> is one of the few providers offering a renewable gas supply in addition to green electricity. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its Green Gas tariff is currently 12 per cent 'green', with the gas produced from grass, but the company insists that percentage will rise as it develops a network of 'gas mills'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> But back to the electricity deal, <strong>the tariff itself will cost the average household with an electric car using 5,500kWh of electricity £987 per year.

There are 300 across the country and you can see their locations <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ecotricity.co.uk/for-the-road/our-electric-highway">here</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It costs 17p per unit of energy you use with a £3 connection fee for each charging session, but anyone signed up to its EV tariff doesn't have to pay the £3 connection fee.<strong> </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ovo</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This small energy supplier is often lauded for its customer service. As part of <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.ovoenergy.com/">Ovo</a>'s range of tariffs it already offers a Green Electricity deal, but this comes at a premium costing around £120 more over the course of two years than its standard electricity tariff. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those signing up to its EV Everywhere tariff however get an upgrade to green electricity for free.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The two-year fixed-rate tariff offered to electric car households comes with 100 per cent renewable electricity at no extra cost.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">While the word calls to mind Dr Who and the Daleks, it really means opting instead for ‘nominee’ accounts with online stockbrokers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mark Taylor, of Selftrade Equiniti, says: ‘The reason the uptake is far slower than for other online financial services is investors like to own something physical.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But a deadline to remove share certificates for new companies as early as 2023 will add pressure on shareholders to enter the electronic age.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Moving shares out of paper format into an electronic one involves putting them in nominee accounts. You are still the legal owner but your name does not appear on the firm’s share register.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Justin Urquhart Stewart, co-founder of wealth manager Seven Investment Management, says: ‘Share certificates used to be pretty and collectable. Now they are plain and a nuisance with the potential to grow into an administrative burden.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Investors also have to keep up to date on what is happening with the shares. Urquhart Stewart says: ‘Companies change name, merge, and even dissolve. You need only look at the changing face of the high street to know it is not just esoteric companies that suffer such a fate.’</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says: ‘Investments can be confusing enough without paper being involved. As the paperwork mounts up, so too does the potential to lose sight of important tax allowances such as Isas.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Holding shares in nominee accounts used to mean shareholders losing certain rights, including voting at annual general meetings – and receiving any perks. But now brokers often allow investors to keep these rights.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you stumble across a pile of certificates the options are either to wade through them yourself and contact registrars to check their validity, or ask a financial adviser or stockbroker to help.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Experts at Seven regularly help people struggling with such a challenge, including an elderly widow who found 80 paper share certificates in her husband’s files.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her financial planner – Ian Morrison of Morrison Personalised Wealth Management in Linlithgow, West Lothian – says: ‘The husband had kept hold of certificates that were no longer valid, making it difficult to work out which ones were genuine, what they were worth and how much tax might be due.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The wealth managers did the spadework and now we have assembled a more tax-efficient portfolio for the future.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>HOW TO SELL PAPER SHARES</strong></p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Watch out for the extra costs in selling paper shares. Banks or stockbrokers may charge a fixed fee plus dealing commission or a percentage charge. For example, Halifax Share Dealing charges 1.25 per cent or a minimum £25 (maximum £125).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the cheapest is online broker Sharedeal Active at £19.50 per holding. At the other end of the scale is TD Direct, which charges £50 plus its usual trading commission for one-off deals of £12.50. This compares with as little as £6 for trading electronically-held shares.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can pare costs by transferring certificates into an online nominee account before selling. Most brokers do not charge for the transfer – then you can sell them at the broker’s usual dealing rate.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-5ffcaaf0-a623-11e7-96aa-47462012269b">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Where did I put it?

This costs £65.32. (For holdings worth £1,000 to £5,000 the fee is £77.18. For £5,000 to £10,000 it is £95.28.)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If I were then to sell my shares via Royal Mail’s arrangements that would cost an extra £45 – £110.32 in total. At the last count my shares were worth £130 more than I paid for them. That would give me around £20 profit (ouch). Alternatively, I can pay Royal Mail £65.32 for a new certificate and sell the shares through another broker. Or sell via Royal Mail’s service without obtaining a new certificate – costing £50 plus 1.75 per cent, again roughly £65.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What will I be doing today?

Currently the state pension age is 65 for men and 63 for women.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it will rise to 68 within 20 years. This is because, as life expectancy increases, we are spending longer in retirement. And that is proving very costly for Government finances.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The changes are happening in stages. The pension age rises to 65 for women by the end of 2018, and then rapidly for both sexes to 66 by 2020 and 67 by 2028.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In July, ministers said the state pension age would rise to 68 between 2037 and 2039, rather than from 2044, as originally planned.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pace of these changes has been criticised for leaving older workers — and particularly women — little time to adjust their finances and retirement plans.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Danny Cox, chartered financial planner for adviser Hargreaves Lansdown, says: 'Cashing in a final salary pension is very rarely a sensible idea.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stephen Cameron, pensions director at Aegon, warns: 'Don't cash in a defined benefit pension if you think you can only just get by in retirement. As soon as you transfer out, you will be taking a risk and you won't be able to change your mind.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The main thing you will gain is flexibility. With a final salary pension you can take a tax-free lump sum worth about a quarter of the overall value but the rest of the money must be taken as a regular taxable income.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When you or your widow die, the pension payments stop, so you won't be able to pass a lump of money on to your children or grandchildren.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you transfer out of a final salary pension then you can invest the money as you wish, use it to pay debts and there may be some left to pass when you die (<a style="font-weight: bold;" class="" href="/money/pensions/article-4922968/Why-pensions-secret-weapon-beat-death-taxes.html">there is more on this here</a>).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And if you are successful with your investments, there is also the chance of getting more money in retirement overall.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">What you must think about before cashing out of a defined benefit pension scheme<strong> </strong></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1. Investing challenge</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any transfer sum is unlikely to buy the income you get from your occupational pension without you taking a considerable investment risk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let's says you had a £10,000 a year pension and your employer offered you 30 times that to transfer out. This would give you £300,000 to buy a replacement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With current annuity rates, you could get an income of about £7,200 index-linked with a widow's income for your spouse. There is no other way to guarantee an income to this degree.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The alternative would be to use income drawdown where you would risk running out of money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Realistically, you would need to receive a lump sum of around 40 times your annual pension value to buy the same income you get from a defined benefit scheme.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. Tax implications</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is a lifetime limit of £1 million on the amount of money you are allowed to have in a pension pot. Let's say you have a £30,000 a year pension and your employer offers you 40 times that amount to leave the scheme. This would provide a £1.2 million lump sum.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once you take more than £1 million from your pension there is a 55 per cent tax charge — so that top £200,000 is worth rather less.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Defined benefit pensions are treated much more leniently. You basically multiply the annual pension at the time you take it by 20.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So a £30,000 a year pension would be judged to be worth £600,000 —well below the lifetime limit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tax is not a reason in itself to reject an offer, says Jamie Jenkins, head of pension strategy at Standard Life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You wouldn't turn down a bonus payment from work just because it put you into a higher tax bracket, so you shouldn't be judging whether or not to cash in your pension based purely on the tax,' he says. 'There are many other factors to consider, too.'</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-66b590a0-a36c-11e7-9951-fdda568996f5">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">BEWARE OF THE £1M CAP</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <img id="i-e3d9b2d986da1dd6" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/09/26/21/44B5371D00000578-4922958-There_is_a_lifetime_limit_of_1_million_on_the_amount_of_money_yo-a-14_1506456841084.jpg" height="391" width="586" alt="There is a lifetime limit of £1 million on the amount of money you are allowed to have in a pension pot" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">All savers face a lifetime allowance on the amount they can build up in a pension scheme.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today, that limit is £1 million, which includes the value of any final salary schemes you belong to.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It sounds a lot, but the limit has been repeatedly cut over the years and increasingly doctors, accountants and other middle-class professionals are being hit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The cap was introduced at £1.5 million in the 2006 tax year, before gradually rising to a peak of £1.8 million in 2010. But a series of cuts reduced it to £1.5 million in 2012, then £1.25 million in 2014 and finally £1 million in April last year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You must keep within the rules as anything over the allowance is taxed at up to a whopping 55 per cent when you take the excess out as a lump sum — and at 25 per cent on top of your marginal rate of tax when you take it as a regular income.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you get close to the cap, use Isas instead. You now have a £20,000 a year allowance — which is more than enough for most savers.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. Employer strength</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As BHS employees have discovered, pensions aren't always as secure as you might hope.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even if your employer reneges on their promises you have the Pension Protection Fund to fall back on. For those yet to retire, this guarantees 90 per cent of your pension, which rises with Consumer Price Index inflation to a maximum of 2.5 per cent a year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, there is a cap which varies with age. For 65-year-olds this is £38,505.61 — 90 per cent of which is £34,6550.05. Those with very large pensions and financially weak employers may wish to take this into consideration.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS money" data-version="2" id="mol-9757f950-a36c-11e7-9951-fdda568996f5">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">LEARN THE JARGON</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Before you can decide what to do with your pension, you should know what kind you have.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Traditionally, big companies and the Government gave their staff so-called defined benefit pensions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This means your employer promises you a set payout every month for the rest of your life in retirement. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It did not change with stock market rises or falls — and you never had to buy an annuity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The most generous defined benefit pensions are called final salary schemes in which staff receive an amount based on what they earn at the end of their career.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, final salary pensions proved unaffordablefor employers and many firms now have huge pension black holes in their company accounts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most have switched to less valuable defined contribution, or money purchase, pensions. This is where you get a pot of money when you retire, rather than a set income. The onus is on you to build it up and then make it last for your lifetime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Previously, the Government forced people with these pensions to turn their pots into an annuity, a fixed monthly income for life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But since the new freedoms were introduced in 2015, over-55s have been able to withdraw some or all of their pot when they like.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4. Check the offer</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">John Lawson, head of retirement policy at Aviva, says that those offered a large transfer value should make sure they're looking at the right figures.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The important thing is the rate being offered compared with your revalued pension. This is generally around 30 to 33 times at the moment,' he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The revalued pension is what your pension is actually worth now. For example, you may have left a job when your pension was worth £10,000 a year. But since then, inflation-based increases may have pushed it to £12,000 a year. So an offer of £360,000 would be 30 times your pension, not 36 times.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5. Tax-free cash</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A large transfer offer might be worth considering if you want to take the maximum amount of tax-free cash and your employer's scheme is not generous in this respect, but is offering a lot for you to transfer out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can take a quarter of your pension as tax-free cash in exchange for some of your pension income.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some employers may offer £25,000 cash for every £1,000 of annual income you give up, others may offer as little as £12,000. So if your employer scheme is miserly on tax-free cash and generous on transfer values then the sums might stack up — if you want the money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>6. Life expectancy</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you or your spouse come from a family with a long life expectancy and you've lived a healthy lifestyle then the defined benefit pension offers the security of knowing you'll always have a decent income.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, if you're a heavy smoker from a family with a history of heart disease then you might take a different attitude.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>7. Benefits</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you transfer the money out, you need to be sure how it will impact upon any benefits you receive or may be entitled to in future — especially if you plan to remove it from your pension entirely. This is particularly the case if you have to start paying for care later in life.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">So who would leaving final salary benefit?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first and most obvious category are single people. Defined benefit schemes are pooled investments where everyone is sharing the risk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You might not need life insurance and pensions for widowed spouses and dependent children. If you take the transfer money you'll then be able to leave any left over to nieces, nephews, friends or others who would not benefit under a defined benefit scheme.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another group who might consider taking the money are those who have a terminal illness or short life expectancy. Those with lifestyles that are likely to shorten their life expectancy such as heavy smokers might also want to weigh up the options.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While your widow may only get half your final salary pension they could have all of the money if you transferred out. But remember that if you transfer out, any life insurance cover will be lost.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bear in mind that if you are under 75 when you die then you can give the money to whoever you please and they will inherit it tax-free and be able to spend it immediately.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over 75, the money becomes taxable at their highest rate when they draw it. read our <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="" href="/money/pensions/article-4922968/Why-pensions-secret-weapon-beat-death-taxes.html">guide to passing on pensions free of IHT</a>.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Why you need financial advice</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">These are highly complex decisions that will depend on your personal circumstances and those of your relatives.

That is roughly a pension of £1,500 a year at normal retirement age.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The adviser may take a fee from your pension, but good advice can prevent you and your nearest and dearest being tens of thousands of pounds worse off over the course of your and their retirement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, even if you decide you want to cash in a defined benefit pension you may find it difficult to get anyone to help you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A number of advisers are refusing to take on new cases.

To raise funds, it offers bonds that pay between 3.9 per cent and 8 per cent a year. The payouts come from interest LCF charges on its loans.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are three options — a one-year bond paying 3.9 per cent, a two-year at 6.5 per cent and three-year paying 8 per cent. The minimum investment is £5,000 and you cannot access your money during the fixed period.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">THE RISKS: LCF insists that companies put up property or other assets as security in case they can’t pay. However, you could take a hit if a company defaults.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">LCF says it has repaid all interest and capital to investors since 2012.

But if they take enough to push their total income over £45,000 a year then any money over this level will be taxed at 40 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Someone who has no other taxable income could currently take up to £11,500 — the personal allowance — from a pension inheritance every year and pay no tax on it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So you could split your pension among a number of grandchildren who don’t pay tax, which may help them with housing or university costs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the tax rules mean the consequences for a higher rate taxpayer can be devastating if they are not careful.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They would pay 40 per cent as a starting point on any inheritance they took, and if they took enough to push their income over £100,000 a year they would start to lose their personal allowance.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">This could lead to that part of the pension being effectively taxed at 60 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This situation can be avoided by leaving the pension invested and taking it gradually. There is no need to take an inherited pension all at once.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Phasing the inheritance can, for those whose benefactors die over the age of 75, reduce the tax bill.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These rules mean it may be more tax efficient for you to dig into your Isa savings before touching pension savings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Isas can be passed on to a spouse when you die, but if the money is to go to children or others then it goes into the overall pot and counts towards your inheritance tax (IHT) nil rate band, which stands at £325,000.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS money" data-version="2" id="mol-46584ab0-a2f8-11e7-93be-5f2697335f64">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">COMPLAIN IF THINGS GO WRONG </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">If something goes wrong with your pension, complain.

You should put your gripe in writing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you don’t get anywhere — or you don’t get the outcome you had hoped for — you’ll need to escalate the complaint.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are unhappy with poor advice that you have received then you should contact the Financial Ombudsman Service on 0800 023 4567.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its independent adjudicators can also help with some types of complaint about how a pension is sold or marketed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can’t complain simply because an investment has underperformed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For help in complaining about how your pension has been run, the information you’ve received or an unacceptable delay, call the Pensions Advisory Service on 0300 123 1047 or by using its online enquiry form at pensionsadvisory service.org.uk.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is also a property allowance on top of this of £100,000, which will rise to £175,000 by 2020, but this applies only when a property or revenue from the sale of a property is left to direct descendants such as children and grandchildren, including adoptive or step-children.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Right now, each property owner can potentially leave £425,000 in total free of IHT and by 2020 the limit will be £500,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These allowances can be combined by spouses and civil partners, giving the last survivor a potential £1 million by 2020.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Above the nil rate band everything is taxed at 40 per cent. There is one exception to the tax-planning opportunities.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is where someone close to death starts to pile far more into their pension than they had previously.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, if someone with a terminal disease puts £30,000 into their pension when they had previously put in only £3,000 a year then HMRC would probably regard this as a deliberate attempt to avoid inheritance tax.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If HMRC suspects avoidance, it can usually go back up to two years to claim IHT it believes is due.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, if you do plan to make the most of these benefits, you need to make sure your pension scheme knows who you want to receive your money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can make an expression of wishes, telling the pension scheme trustees who you would like to receive your money when you die. This can be split in any way you choose.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The trustees must take account of your wishes, but they do not have to follow them if they believe there is a good reason for distributing your money differently.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you want more control then you could set up your own trust and appoint your own trustees.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">John Lawson, head of pensions policy at Aviva, says: ‘One clear advantage of making the expression of wishes or using an individual trust is that when you die your pension should be sorted out relatively quickly.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Without an expression of wishes it could take several months, or even years, for the trustees to sort out who should get your money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stephen Cameron, pensions director of Aegon, says the knowledge that your pension can be inherited could potentially make them a useful tool for social care funding.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘You could, for example, set an amount aside in your pension that you would withdraw if you needed social care.

</div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Setting some goals drives your decisions about what to do with your windfall. With a direction in mind, you can plan more effectively.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Consider working with an expert; whether that’s a financial adviser, accountant or tax expert. You want the right type of professional for your situation. Depending on the size or complexity of your windfall, you may even need a team of experts.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong></strong></strong><strong>Pay off debts and possibly your mortgage</strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The interest rate on your credit card is likely to be significantly higher than anything you earn in a savings account or by investing that money instead. You may not want to pay off all your debts with your windfall, but if you can it’s important to deal with any high interest debt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Making an extra mortgage payment or two will mean you end up paying less interest in the long run. However bear in mind that once you have used your capital, you will no longer have access to this money. If the interest rate on your mortgage is very low, you might be better off investing the money for capital growth instead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is very important that you check the terms of your mortgage before you make a large overpayment. Many providers will charge you for early repayments.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong></strong><strong>Bulk up your emergency fund</strong><strong></strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before you start investing, it is important to establish a rainy day fund in an easy access savings account to cover emergencies or unexpected costs. You’ll thank yourself if you unexpectedly experience a job loss or health setback.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a generally accepted rule of thumb, aim to build up your rainy day savings to the equivalent of one of the following:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">• Three months’ income, or </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">• Three to six months’ household expenses </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The exact amount you need depends on what your needs and financial responsibilities are.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong></strong></strong><strong>Think about your children</strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is not hard to be fearful for youngsters today. Governments will be increasingly stretched, final salary pension schemes are already difficult to find and the property market is getting ever further out of reach.</p><img id="i-5f5d61001c07f6f6" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/13/09/416203AA00000578-4572824-image-a-2_1497341273172.jpg" height="382" width="306" alt="Jeannie Boyle urges those who come into money to think before they spend" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even with a relatively modest windfall it is possible to leave a legacy for a young person. Junior Isas are a good choice if you would like to fund university costs because they allow access at age 18. If you would like to help with a deposit for a first property then the new Lifetime Isa might be more suitable – but beware, there is not much flexibility with this product.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are thinking about giving away bigger sums you can use a discretionary trust to retain some control over the money. Giving 18 year olds access to large sums of money is not always wise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><strong>Do not leave it all in the bank</strong><strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once you have a rainy day fund, start saving for the future by putting your money to work. The stock market offers the best chance of protecting your wealth from inflation, albeit with some level of risk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the current market environment bank savings rates (eg rates on cash Isas) are significantly lower than inflation. You can make the comparison yourself online by visiting the Office of National Statistics’ website and comparing the Consumer Price Index with the deals offered by your bank.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With rates as they currently stand, money left in the bank will steadily lose value (in real terms) over time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong></strong></strong><strong>Use your tax-efficient ISA allowance</strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are lucky enough to have a significant windfall, start by putting the maximum £20,000 inside this year’s Isa allowance. This can be cash, stocks and shares, the new Lifetime Isa, the Innovative Finance Isa or a mixture of them all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Invest at the beginning of each tax year (6 April) to get the maximum benefit. You can continue to add to your Isa each year, using your new Isa allowance.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><strong>Invest in a pension</strong><strong></strong></p><img id="i-fe89fa364a48c6f2" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/13/09/384A882400000578-4572824-image-a-4_1497342278763.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="Pensions have great tax benefits but those who invest in these product would not be able to access the pot until after the age of 55" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pensions also offer valuable tax benefits and have tax relief added in by the Government. If you are in danger of paying tax on your windfall then pensions are a brilliant way to claw back some of that cash.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">25 per cent of your pension fund is available as a tax-free lump sum after age 55.

</div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Is stamp collecting still in decline worldwide?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Warren told us: 'There is no doubt that stamp collecting among today's youth is nowhere near as ubiquitous as it was in the 1950/60s. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Then, half of kids - and almost every boy - had a stamp collection. Today, probably fewer than one in 100 has one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'With increasing leisure time and disposable income in retirement, plenty of people are taking up the hobby as an interesting and absorbing pastime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It would be wrong to say that stamp collecting is as popular as ever, but there are still tens of thousands of active collectors in the UK alone, and many millions worldwide, especially in Asia.'</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">The '£50' collection that contained £40k stamp</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unearthing a rare stamp or collection is akin to finding a needle in a haystack, according to Mr Warren. However, they do sometimes turn up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, someone came in with a collection of stamps which the owner wanted to get rid of and almost sold for £50 previously.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, a check uncovered a rare 1850 Prince Consort stamp, one of only three examples known – the other two are in Royal collection and in the Royal Mint heritage collection.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In layman's terms, Mr Warren explains it was a trial printing to see how Albert's face would look in a stamp, instead of Victoria's, and what made this one especially valuable is that it was perforated - holes round the edge - rather than being imperforate, as most issued stamps up to that date had been.</p><img id="i-56d4ae8c84434ffc" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/08/11/430B0EE200000578-4760444-image-a-3_1502186703574.jpg" height="303" width="306" alt="Rare stamps: These Chinese stamps were spotted in an old insignificant notebook - and sold for a giant sum at auction" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The stamp sold for £40,000 at auction. A decade later, he spotted it again through another dealer listed at £175,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another example is two blocks of Chinese stamps, dated from 1897. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The two remarkable blocks were discovered in an old and insignificant notebook, part of a collection brought to Rick's offices for valuation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They belonged to the owner's grandfather and it is thought that they remained in this book, unnoticed, for at least eighty years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They were described at the auction in 2008 as some of the most important items of Chinese philately.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Both blocks were affixed by their margins to one page in this book. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The margin of one block was already thinned, probably from when it was removed from its original page in the printer's archive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The block which was in the best condition sold at auction for £300,000.</p><img id="i-1995429d5788c713" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/08/11/084D291700000514-4760444-image-a-26_1502188339950.jpg" height="442" width="634" alt="Record breaker: The stamp above sold for £5.6m in 2014 - still a record amount for a stamp" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Are stamp values increasing?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Mr Warren, the longer-term price trends for rare stamps continue to be upward, especially for those in good condition.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says: 'This is borne out both by catalogue values and, more importantly, auction realisations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'New records are being set all the time and there are few lots which remain unsold among the more choice items.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The most expensive stamp ever sold was a very rare 19th century one from former British colony, British Guiana, in South America which sold for £5.6million at auction in New York.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The one-cent magenta stamp had been sold three times before, each time setting the auction record for a single stamp. It measures just 2.5cm by 2.5cm.</p><img id="i-3885ae124314e0c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/08/11/430B0EBE00000578-4760444-image-m-7_1502186803883.jpg" height="378" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-477250e1e48f1506" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/08/11/430B0EC900000578-4760444-image-m-9_1502186821804.jpg" height="378" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Are my Pitcairn Island stamps worth a mint?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">We've all seen those television shows in which an expert finds hidden treasure from around the home. It is then valued at thousands of pounds - and we all wonder if we have something laying around of a similar ilk.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Around a decade ago, my father 'gifted' his stamp collection to me. He had taken a random interest in ones from the Pitcairn Islands, a tiny little place with a population of 50, famous for the Mutiny on the Bounty. It is also an British Overseas Territory.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For this reason, obtaining a valuation for the stamps has not been a straightforward process. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The nearest high street stamp shop closed down some time ago - a common theme, Mr Warren says. At one point there were nearly 100 on the Strand, London, alone.

class="mol-para-with-font">For the first 13 weeks during an assessment period anyone under 25 gets £57.90 a week, everyone else gets up to £73.10.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Next there is a Work Capability Assessment to sort you into one of two groups – the Work-Related Activity Group or the Support Group. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those who are unwell or disabled typically qualify for the Support category, which pays a slightly higher rate at up to £109.65 a week and won't require you to attend any meetings to get you back into work. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is also an enhanced disability premium of £15.90 a week and a severe disability premium at £62.45 per week under the income-assessed element. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Entitled To's Holmes adds:
