<p class="mol-para-with-font">Previously, when a scan showed a fatty liver I used to have conversations along the lines of, ‘So are you really only drinking one or two glasses of wine at the weekend?’ We are used to patients under-reporting alcohol consumption, but it turns out that our scepticism may be unfair because alcohol is no longer the commonest cause for liver damage. It’s more likely to be poor diet that has fed the surge in damage to this poor organ. Storing excess fat around the tummy, where it wraps around and infiltrates important organs such as the liver and pancreas, causes inflammation and a rise in liver enzymes. This may be the cause of your discomfort.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Given that you are not a big drinker, you may have an early stage of a condition called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). If this persists, the liver can become scarred and damaged. NAFLD has even overtaken alcoholic liver disease as one of the most common causes for liver transplant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But don’t despair. Although there is little evidence for effective medication, we know that by changing to a low-carbohydrate, Mediterranean-style diet, cutting calories (for some people reducing alcohol) and making lifestyle changes, you can reverse the damage, draining away the excess fat. The liver should recover fully, allowing enzymes to revert to normal. What’s even more encouraging is that by doing this you also reduce your chance of getting diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and kidney disease.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most people who have NAFLD are not aware of it, but one of the best, and incredibly easy, tests is to measure your waist circumference. Do this with a tape by measuring all the way around your middle, level with your belly button. Your waist measurement should be less than half your height. If your liver continues to show signs of inflammation, your GP may refer you to a gastroenterologist for tests such as ultrasound elastography or even a liver biopsy. In the meantime, you might want to lose those excess inches – and rid the liver of that troublesome fat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The magic mineral our bodies love</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s zinc: used by up to 300 enzymes, affecting everything from immune function to wound healing, cell growth and digestion to inflammation and blood sugars. We need to consume small amounts daily, though, as it can’t be stored.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s best to get your daily quota through zinc-rich foods, including red meat, poultry, fish, as well as beans, wheatgerm, legumes, nuts, seeds and wholegrains. Vegetarians may be at higher risk of deficiency.</p><img id="i-2aa089c2d1318ee2" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/12/8086384-6554217-image-a-18_1546519872999.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="It’s best to get your daily quota of zinc through zinc-rich foods, including red meat, poultry, fish, as well as beans, wheatgerm, legumes, nuts, seeds and wholegrains" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pharmacist and nutritional therapist Richa Puri (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://ifm.org/">ifm.org</a>) advises speaking to a GP first. ‘Zinc acetate or gluconate taken for a few days may reduce the length of colds. I tend to take a zinc supplement at this time of year. Zinc of up to 15mg can be taken daily. Higher doses may be needed for conditions such as diarrhoea, acne and age-related vision loss, though may have side effects. Avoid taking alongside medications such as diuretics and certain antibiotics.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">If you have a question you would like answered, email drclarebailey@you.co.uk.

I bought him a copy of Being John Lennon by Ray Connolly. I’d read rave reviews and an extract. John had belatedly acknowledged that Yoko Ono was the inspiration behind ‘Imagine’. David had sent me a text, after watching a documentary on Channel 4, that he ‘was pleased to see Yoko get the recognition she deserved’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I wondered then if that’s how he sees himself: he is the Yoko to my John. But, of course, no one bought her book of poems, and if she had made a solo record, I doubt it would have gone to number one or be loved almost 50 years later. But I know that, like my ex-husband, David feels used. I expect everyone in a ‘relationship’ with a writer probably feels the same. Unless you’re the sort of writer who leaves out all the unpalatable bits. Helen Fielding only recently admitted Bridget had been based on her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anyway, I thought he’d like the book, so I posted it, along with a card from all my cats. John is his favourite Beatle. Paul is mine. But even so, the day John was shot I was due to go to Rada to audition to become an actress and, on hearing the news on the radio, I couldn’t leave my flat, I was so distressed. John changed so many lives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A few days later and still no thank you. I am writing this with one week to go before Christmas, two weeks before I am due to spend New Year at the home of my ex. I don’t really want to go on my own as that will seem a bit desperate. I think he has a new girlfriend, though I don’t know for sure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’ve just come back from a frosty walk with the dogs to this:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Hi Liz. Are you still coming for NYE? We’re just sorting who goes where. We’re thinking of putting you guys in the annexe. Everyone has been asked to bring booze: whatever your tipple, do please bring it along. And are you still vegan? Is whatshisname still gluten free? I hear you have a third dog, will they be coming with you? Oh, and the stay is strictly off limits, column wise. I’ve already had a few concerned emails from fellow guests. Sorry, but that’s how it is. Take it easy. xxx’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why do even nice things in my life turn into an assault course, with hurdles and water jumps and boggy bits? First of all, ‘we’re’… who is ‘we’? His giant son? New wife? And second of all, I would have taken champagne anyway, without being asked. Why are people so bossy? When I got married, I wrote on the invitation, ‘No gifts, just bring your lovely selves. Your company is all we need.’</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">And – what number are we on, third of all? – what does he mean, am I still vegan? I could email back, ask, ‘Are you still fat?’ And fourth, he knows full well David’s name is David. And, fifth – the worst one of all, to be frank – am I bringing my dogs! That’s like me saying, ‘And will the monosyllabic teens be in attendance?’ And writing ‘I hear you have a third’ is a passive-aggressive way of saying, ‘I don’t read your column now I’m no longer in it.’ And why invite me if he doesn’t want me to write about it? That would be like inviting Paul McCartney and saying, ‘Sorry, Macca. Please don’t tinkle on the piano. Go and sit in the annexe.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I don’t want to be the person in the annexe. I hate annexes. I am always put in the annexe. Take the holiday after I was sacked as editor of Marie Claire. I had gone on the website of the Villa San Michele, just out-side Florence. The photos looked gorgeous: it’s a former monastery, with stone floors and ancient windows and a terrace, decked with bougainvillea, overlooking the red tiles of the Duomo. I spent my (not small) redundancy cheque booking nearly a week there for me and Nirpal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And where did they put us? In the s***ing annexe that was probably erected in 2002. I am always, always the poor relation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I still haven’t heard from David: whether or not he got the book, how my cats are, does he still love me, is he alive – that sort of thing. And so I decide to decline. I have to think of an excuse. I write back, blaming David. At least he’s good for something.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And finally – I’m sorry, but I almost missed the sign-off, I’d been so upset – ‘Take it easy’ (!)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Has he not met me?</p><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="you-ccox">4</span> </strong>Don’t be a TV snob. A friend went on a date and was struggling with conversation, so she asked her prospective beau what he was watching. ‘I don’t have a TV – I read books,’ came the reply, as if he deserved a medal and she was a halfwit. Snobbery of all forms is unattractive, but TV snobbery is particularly misplaced nowadays given how excellent television has become and how many choices we have. Being pointedly rude about <span class="mol-style-italic">Love Island</span> or <span class="mol-style-italic">Bodyguard</span> makes you sound like an out-of-touch geriatric.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5</strong> If you’re sitting next to someone at a dinner or standing next to them at a drinks party, ask questions. Be interested in them. Do not assume that you’re so intriguing the other person only needs to hear about you. A friend has a little trick she often plays if sitting next to a self-obsessed man who won’t stop banging on about himself. ‘And when did you first realise you were so fascinating?’ she asks, and they apparently always answer genuinely. Don’t be the butt of this joke.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>6</strong> You still need to send thank-you cards or letters but it’s totally acceptable to do it online. I often use the website Moonpig to send a postcard. I’ll go online, upload a photo from my phone of the lunch/dinner in question for the front of it, type out a thank-you note for the back, then send it to arrive the next day. Quick, easy, job done.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>7</strong> Never leave your phone on the table when you’re in a restaurant or at someone else’s house. So many do it, eyes flicking from their friends’ faces to their phone to check for a little blinking light. It’s incredibly irritating. Put it away. And don’t do that thing of reaching for your phone halfway through a meeting/lunch/dinner, mumbling vaguely that you’ve ‘just got to check something’ and then scan your emails and all forms of social media because you’re addicted to the dopamine hit. Just leave it for a few minutes/hours. Nobody will die.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>8 </strong>If someone has a poppy seed stuck in their teeth or a drop of gravy on their chin at a party (this is often me), tell them. There’s nothing worse than going to the bathroom only to realise that, while chatting about international affairs, trying to sound intelligent, there was a piece of dill wobbling on my lower lip. Please tell me. We’d all much rather know.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>9</strong> Look people in the eye. It may seem obvious, but it’s one that my stepmother drummed into us as teenagers. ‘Slidey eye,’ she used to say severely of our friends who failed to do this. It looks shifty if you don’t.</p><img id="i-e24ebfbf07865be8" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/15/8092922-6554691-image-a-4_1546530676523.jpg" height="655" width="634" alt="Snobbery of all forms is unattractive, but TV snobbery is particularly misplaced nowadays given how excellent television has become and how many choices we have" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>10</strong> Try to wean yourself off the habit of saying, ‘We must have drinks soon,’ to someone you’d rather never see again. Trying to set up a date for something that will never actually happen is a waste of time for everyone involved.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>11</strong> If you are vegan/haven’t eaten bread since 1997/only eat organic foods that have been locally foraged even though you live in London, and you are asked to dinner at someone’s house, let the host know this when you’re invited. A discreet text or email is fine. ‘I’m so sorry to be difficult but I’m vegan, so do let me know if I can bring something,’ strikes the right tone and gives the host time to prepare. Do not leave it until you’re all sitting around the table and then loudly proclaim, ‘Oh no, I’m so sorry, I can’t possibly eat this chop because I don’t know the name of the lamb it came from.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>12</strong> If you really have to cancel something at the last minute, it’s best to call the other person. Don’t send a WhatsApp with a feeble explanation and a string of sad-face emojis. When you phone, try to sound suitably guilty and offer another date to make up for it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>13</strong> What kind of birthday person are you – the sort who treats it as a week-long festival or the kind who hates the weird pressure to have ‘the best day ever’ and so ignores the whole thing? I’m the latter, but not telling colleagues or friends that it’s your birthday and then casually letting it slip too late in the day when you’re feeling needy can make them feel awkward. Instead, why not simply say, ‘It’s my birthday’, smiling, whenever someone asks you how you are that day, and then graciously accept their congratulations. That way nobody feels guilty.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>14</strong> Don’t always make friends do the running. People with babies and small children should, every now and then, make the effort to travel to see their single mate who usually comes to them. If you are the single friend in this scenario, don’t make passive-aggressive remarks about it; remember, the height of good manners is not making a fuss or making someone else feel uncomfortable. Console yourself with the fact that you weren’t woken up at 5am this morning.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>15</strong> Whatever you do, don’t mention Brexit in polite company – or any company at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>And some very bad manners... </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Being nice to others has always been good etiquette, but it seems that many people still haven’t got the memo.

You may feel guilty about having to tell a friend who has helped you in the past that, on this occasion, you cannot help them. A difficult Jupiter-Neptune aspect warns that it is better to put your friendship at risk than your money, or even your life. CALL 0904 470 1170 (65p per minute)* </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Aquarius 21 JAN-19 FEB</strong> If you recently invested in a money-making scheme, you may learn this week that you’ve been conned. If so, keep your wits about you and extricate yourself from the deal as fast as you can. Making a scene won’t get your money back. Put it down to experience. CALL 0904 470 1171 (65p per minute)*</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Pisces 20 FEB-20 MARCH</strong> Being ambitious is fine as long as you don’t overdo it or invite others to take advantage of you. Today’s Jupiter-Neptune aspect warns that the deal you are about to be offered is not all it seems. Weigh up the pros and cons. If there are more of the latter, pull out. CALL 0904 470 1172 (65p per minute)*</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Aries 21 MARCH-20 APRIL</strong> It may be that your confidence is sky-high but fate is about to find ways to remind you that too much self-belief is not always good. Change is the one constant in life and there will be plenty of it this week. Don’t be afraid but do make sure that you are prepared. CALL 0904 470 1161 (65p per minute)*</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Taurus 21 APRIL-21 MAY</strong> Certain people may delight in trying to undermine your confidence but you don’t have to take their words seriously – or even listen. Act on the assumption that you are right, and your critics are jealous of your success and popularity. It’s not that far from the truth. CALL 0904 470 1162 (65p per minute)*</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Gemini 22 MAY-21 JUNE</strong> If someone you have not been on good terms with of late says something positive about you this week, don’t be suspicious. The planets indicate that they want to bury the hatchet and be friends again. That can only fail if you foolishly hold on to a grudge. CALL 0904 470 1163 (65p per minute)*</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Cancer 22 JUNE-23 JULY </strong>You need more time to pursue your interests – rather than the interests others think you should have. If they won’t give you the time, take it. You’re not obliged to follow a path that bores you just to keep them happy. Make sure they know that, and make sure you act. CALL 0904 470 1164 (65p per minute)*</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Leo 24 JULY-23 AUG</strong> Some people play the victim to get something for nothing but you are not like that and must not allow yourself to be like that. Leos are born to lead and today’s Jupiter-Neptune aspect urges you to ignore others’ endless complaints and do something extraordinary this week. CALL 0904 470 1165 (65p per minute)*</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Virgo 24 AUG-23 SEPT</strong> You seem to be out of step with everyone around you. Whatever the reason, don’t worry, as in a few days, your world will be turned on its head and everyone will then be out of step with you. You have never been one to follow the crowd so don’t start now. CALL 0904 470 1166 (65p per minute)*</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Libra 24 SEPT-23 OCT</strong> Someone you meet will have a profound effect on the way you look at the world. The only danger is that they may persuade you to get involved in a cause that could be a bit negative. Think carefully before you sign up – and make sure you think for yourself. CALL 0904 470 1167 (65p per minute)*</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Scorpio 24 OCT-22 NOV</strong> Don’t worry if a friend turns against you this week. You may miss their unqualified support but, in a way, that is good. You would not nail your own colours to someone else’s mast without thinking about it, so why expect it of them? They too are allowed to have doubts. CALL 0904 470 1168 (65p per minute)*</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sagittarius 23 NOV-21 DEC</strong> You like to be controversial and to stir up strong feelings. However, if you stir too hard this week you may create a monster that is difficult to control and, like all monsters, it will at some stage turn on its master. Words can be powerful so watch what you say. CALL 0904 470 1169 (65p per minute)*</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">To discover more about yourself, visit <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://sallybrompton.com/">sallybrompton.com</a></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">*For a fuller forecast, call the number next to your star sign above.

In the past two years, we’ve squashed every diet myth that happened to be trending on Twitter with the help of specialist dietitians and interviewed our ultimate non-faddy wellness gurus – from Ruby Tandoh to Gizzi Erskine – to show the joy to be had in eating all food. Last March, we hosted the UK’s very first Supper Club Support Group For Anxious Eaters. It seems counterintuitive, but as we suspected, when you provide eating-disorder sufferers with a safe, comfortable environment alongside fellow diners who understand their illness… they eat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The most poignant message comes courtesy of the dietitians, doctors and medical researchers we’ve encountered. It is simply this: eat whatever you want (in moderation, of course) and stop worrying about it.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>EVE’S STORY</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From the burger juice that dribbled down my chin on my first date with my boyfriend, to the Tupperware of chicken soup that my mum forced upon me every time I went back to university, food was always an endless source of pleasure (not in a weird way). Even when acute anxiety struck at the age of 15, I worried about the onset of schizophrenia, whether or not life was in fact one big, never-ending dream… but never food.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I could never be anorexic,’ I used to chime. ‘I love food too much.’ Well, that was before the world discovered Facebook. And Instagram. And wellness bloggers. As it turns out, all it took was one demanding job as a fashion writer and an avid interest in ‘health’ blogs to undo an entire lifetime of carefree eating.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As my weight plummeted to near-fatal levels and I averaged a panic attack a week at dinner times, the self-inflicted ‘diet’ I’d been experimenting with morphed into something a lot more complicated. Mostly because, no matter what the doctors told me, I couldn’t stop. Well, until I ended up in a psychiatric hospital and was forced to consume my required amount of calories every day, that is. What I wasn’t aware of then was the detrimental effect of starvation on the brain – never mind the body.</p><img id="i-39d942773d4184ed" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/16/8095250-6554851-image-m-23_1546534240503.jpg" height="486" width="634" alt="'As no-nonsense journalists, we pledged to combine our investigative skills to combat the menace that is inaccurate, unhelpful food information, and spread the message that Kate Moss was wrong: everything tastes as good, if not better, than skinny feels'. Laura Wears: White shirt, Essentiel Antwerp; Eve wears: Dress, Kitri" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’re unfortunate enough to go without carbohydrates for months on end, the brain is starved of essential sugars, making it perpetually exhausted. Bread was obviously off limits from the minute I decided to go ‘health’. This proved to be a particularly idiotic move considering that, according to NHS guidelines, starchy foods such as potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and cereals should make up just over a third of the food you eat. Apparently, the golden rule of eating ‘healthily’ is, in short, that there are no rules and, as the old saying goes, a little bit of what you fancy really does do you good.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The main dietitian-recommended diet, I’ve learnt, involves eating plenty of starchy foods, vegetables, fruit, nuts, fish, lean meat and plant oils. So, the fashionista who thought she was being clever surviving off measly bowls of chopped-up fruit and veg was, in hindsight, pretty stupid. Not that I would have been receptive to anything other than the toned tummies of my trusted Instagrammers in my time of desperate need.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ‘wellness’ warriors were the source of all my answers and, what’s more, they were the only ones who truly understood my desire to ‘eat right’. I owed them everything. They were the ones who showed me that I could eat pizza after all, providing the base was made from cauliflower. Sweet treats weren’t off limits, either; who needs sugar for sweetness and butter for moisture when sweet potatoes and half a banana do the trick just fine?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before you could say unrefined sugar, I was deemed unfit to care for myself by a team of medical professionals and was threatened with a section order under the Mental Health Act, unless I volunteered to be admitted as an inpatient to the eating-disorders unit of a psychiatric hospital. Suddenly, I had no choice but to eat the sustenance from which I was pathologically abstaining. Largely because there was a 6ft 4in former prison guard sitting opposite me, glaring into my soul, every breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p><img id="i-db3c09b023a572ec" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/16/8095234-6554851-It_is_only_since_we_discovered_that_we_are_not_alone_that_everyt-a-24_1546534464805.jpg" height="951" width="634" alt="'It is only since we discovered that we are not alone that everything began to make sense. The power of sharing the load with another who ‘gets’ it is almost medicinal'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Can you guess what my prescribed diet consisted of? Protein, carbohydrates, fats, fruit and vegetables – in intricately calculated, balanced proportions. And not a chia seed in sight. Within a month, I was able to engage in meaningful conversations with my friends and family without zoning out every seven seconds. I finished reading an entire book for the first time in months. No longer was my brain consumed with thoughts of calories, fat and weight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The root of my anxiety, I now know, was death. Well, insecurity, a lack of confidence – and death. Said death came courtesy of my dad, four days before my 13th birthday. He’d been ill with cancer since I was seven. Although my wonderful parents had gone above and beyond to hide the chemotherapy drugs from my brother and me, much of my childhood was accompanied by a sense of uncertainty and – at times – sheer terror. As a child, there’s not much more terrifying than the death of one of your parents. So imagine, then, at a time when new parts of your body are randomly growing, that the very thing you fear most in the world happens. It makes you petrified of just about everything.</p><img id="i-3ee4d1c343be09b4" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/16/8095368-6554851-image-m-18_1546534050031.jpg" height="357" width="306" alt="Laura, aged 19" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-49e4d01837ac4f5f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/16/8095364-6554851-image-a-19_1546534057736.jpg" height="357" width="306" alt="Eve at 23 in Budapest with her boyfriend Will" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, my dad’s death didn’t cause my eating disorder. From death day to eating-disorder day I went through almost ten years of totally carefree eating. Sure, the repercussions of watching a parent die perhaps dialled up a notch on my vulnerability scale, but I’m sure there are plenty of half-orphans out there who haven’t developed an eating disorder. Perhaps, instead, it was being a shy child who never quite found her safety in friendship groups that propelled me to damaging levels of insecurity. Maybe the sudden immersion in a world of lollipop-head models and perpetual-dieter fashion writer colleagues kickstarted something that was there all along.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The most likely truth is, of course, that it was a combination of all these factors. What it wasn’t, however, was anything to do with my capacity to enjoy eating. Nor, I believe, was it really related to what I saw in the mirror. As psychologist Kimberley Wilson explains: ‘For many women, eating disorders aren’t anything to do with a desire to be thin but rather, somewhere along the way, they have internalised a feeling of unworthiness, not being good enough, or not fitting in.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The most heartbreaking part? It needn’t have gone that far. Just as seamlessly as I did develop an eating disorder; I could have quite easily not. The pervasive toxicity that is diet culture and thinness was catapulted into my field of vision at exactly the ‘right’ time. I was confused, vulnerable, impressionable and desperate to belong. The challenge of thinness offered a convenient distraction. Who has brain space to assess the entrenched terror of rejection from a new job or relationship when they’re almost blind with hunger? Yet, through clinging to this coping mechanism, I disrupted the sanctity of a harmonious relationship with food.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, four years on, nothing seems quite as scary any more. My brain rewards me with experiences of genuine enjoyment, as opposed to its previous role: permanent panic. While mental illness doesn’t evaporate, connection with like-minded crusaders and carefree eaters (not to mention a ton of therapy) has quietened those internal demons enough for me to devour many a chocolate cake… and more. And I take pleasure in the fact that my unique insight means I can stand beside others in the darkness and help them find their way out, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>LAURA’S STORY</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Growing up, I don’t remember gold stars being handed out in exchange for good behaviour in my house, but I do remember KitKats in abundance. I also remember mashed potato thick with lumps, mixed with strips of cheddar cheese and tinned spaghetti. My childhood has given me an unbreakable love for junk food that I think will last until my dying days.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although I was a melancholic and worried child – the sort to fret about global warming every time I cleaned my teeth – I grew up unable to identify this aggressive angst as anything other than complaining or moaning, when in reality I have always suffered with episodes of mild depression. I remember going to see a counsellor in college, after I’d spent weeks in tears, only for her to tell me that my ‘depression’ wasn’t actually depression. Imagine that: a counsellor telling me that my mental health concerns were false, instead of referring me to a specialist. A couple of weeks after my last session with this woman I went on my first diet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Food was always the thing I turned to whenever I felt lacking in love or attention; it was also how I celebrated when those needs were fully met. Food held my hand when boys I fancied didn’t fancy me back; it was the salve to heal the wounds left behind when I didn’t get into my first choice of university.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was 16 when a man made a comment that I had put on weight. I was a 5ft 7in, athletic teenager, and even though I’d never bought a piece of clothing beyond a size 10, I had no reason to doubt this man. I went home, stripped down to my underwear and let the realisation that I was fat (I wasn’t) sink in and infect my brain. My heart crashed to the floor along with all my goals, dreams and self-esteem. Not only did I have to worry about boys and acne, but now I had to worry about calories, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I tackled my first diet the way I tackle most things, head-on and with both enthusiasm and naivety. I was totally uneducated about food and began restricting what I ate over a month until I lost a significant amount of weight. Coupled with a gruelling workout schedule, I became exhausted, unhappy – but, most importantly to me, I became thin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I yearned for an alternative to going hungry all the time, and one day experimented with making myself sick. To my surprise, I was pretty good at it. Now I could eat everything at my disposal and just empty it all down the toilet! Can you imagine my delight? Little did I know that bulimia would evolve into a monster far greater and more aggressive than anything I had ever experienced. I hurtled out of control, losing friends and spending all my free time and money on food so that I could throw it up again – sometimes I would perform this routine up to six times a day.</p><img id="i-bbeb067efc5f3ba3" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/16/8095244-6554851-_To_enjoy_food_without_being_hit_by_an_enormous_meteorite_of_gui-a-25_1546534532788.jpg" height="951" width="634" alt="'To enjoy food without being hit by an enormous meteorite of guilt feels foreign to me, but that is how I now eat,' writes Laura" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bulimia switched from something I’d just try to see if it worked to a routine that was completely ruining my life. (Because of this you can excuse me for wanting to punch the nearest wall when I see jokes thrown about on Twitter about bulimia being the ‘cheater’s diet’.) I kept shtoom about my problem until the age of 21, when I finally plucked up the courage to tell my parents.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I managed to kick the bulimia over time, but this only exposed a previously masked binge-eating disorder, which added an additional two stone to my frame since I was unable to purge the evidence. I was unable to return to a ‘normal’ way of eating after having bulimia for such a long time and, because I couldn’t stop myself from eating, my body turned bloated and sore under the burden of having to regularly digest enormous quantities of food.</p><img id="i-60eb0221b1da62ee" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/18/8094668-6554851-image-a-1_1546538500967.jpg" height="1019" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Recovering from a binge-eating disorder left me vulnerable to yo-yo dieting again. In a bid to avoid adding fuel to my dormant eating disorder, I tried veganism, as I had seen on social media countless before-and-after photos of people who had shed tons of weight by turning to this ‘lifestyle’. Losing weight was still the thing that I believed would ‘cure’ me. I think veganism is brilliant if it’s followed for ethical and environmental reasons, but I was simply using it as a way to keep my body small, and it became a dangerous shield for further disordered eating without the fear of anyone questioning me about it. My veganism lasted six months, even though I realised it wasn’t for me a month in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When it came to weight-management methods, nothing was left unsampled. Carb-free, vegetarian, Dukan, fasting, Atkins, the alkaline way – you name the diet, I tried it. I’d buy books from unqualified bloggers with large Instagram followings, convinced that because these ‘meal plans’ and ‘healthy recipes’ weren’t labelled as diets, my obsessing over their food rules was totally normal. Of course I now realise that I was simply using their ‘methods’ as a way to disguise my own eating disorder. But nothing worked – at least, nothing helped me lose weight and keep it off, something that I never needed to do in the first place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To enjoy food without being hit by an enormous meteorite of guilt feels foreign to me, but that is how I now eat. After six years of juggling multiple eating disorders and fad diets, this new freedom is taking some getting used to.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I never thought that I would get to the point in my life where I could eat pasta for lunch and not feel the need to compensate with a run. I never thought that I could wake up in the morning content with not weighing myself and feel happy, knowing that my mind is brilliant and that my nonexistent thigh gap does not detract from my worth. Most of all, I am proud of myself for turning such a negative experience into a weapon to help others who are going through what I did. Now I can be the voice I wish the younger me had had.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">How to Feel the Fear and Eat It Anyway by Eve Simmons and Laura Dennison will be published by Mitchell Beazley on Thursday, priced £10.99.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Enter Alicia Rodis, the world’s first intimacy coordinator, on hand to guide A-listers through the awkwardness not to mention the potential lawsuits of movie sex scenes</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong> </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong></p><img id="i-7f46afbcb6fdf65b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/10/8130456-6558051-_Alicia_above_makes_sure_the_sex_scenes_are_easy_and_comfortable-a-16_1546944417463.jpg" height="951" width="634" alt="‘Alicia (above) makes sure the sex scenes are easy and comfortable,’ says Emily Meade, who plays a porn star in TV series The Deuce, about the rise of the adult film industry in 1970s New York" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alicia Rodis faked her first orgasm in front of hundreds of people at just 17.  She was performing in a play at her local theatre, but nobody gave her any coaching for that scene. ‘The director’s attitude was just, “OK, go!”’ she recalls. ‘People tell actors to “be a professional”, but there is no professional protocol for simulated sex.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, Alicia, now 36, is changing all that as the entertainment industry’s first and foremost ‘intimacy coordinator’, making sure that actors have – or at least look as though they’re having – great sex on screen. Her role isn’t seedy – this is not pornography – but, just like off-screen sex, on-screen sex is potentially awkward and difficult to talk about.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I know people who, in their real-life intimate moments, can’t bring themselves to say: “Can I put my hand here? Are you comfortable with that?” And we’re asking actors to do it, often naked, with someone they may not even know,’ she says. So, part counsellor, part negotiator and part choreographer, Alicia, who was hired by cable channel HBO for its drama The Deuce (set in the porn industry in 1970s New York), is taking the awkwardness out of sex scenes as well as helping to dodge the potential legal and emotional pitfalls when nudity, cameras and feigned passion are involved.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> On the New York set, Alicia’s role involves the prosaically practical, including providing breath mints, antiseptic wipes and mats for actors to kneel on to make sure they don’t get bruises while performing simulated sex acts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Margaret Judson, an actress in The Deuce – which also stars Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Franco – described Alicia as ‘like a chaperone at a prom. She made sure the man playing opposite me sanitised his hands before we started, and wiped them down after every take,’ she has said. ‘She checked in with me constantly, bringing water and coffee and mints. She also choreographed some movements, much like a stunt director.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alicia is also in charge of the amusing but important task of sourcing replacements for what are known in the trade, rather indelicately, as ‘sn**** patches’ and ‘c*** socks’. The costuming of sex scenes has long left a lot to be desired – flimsy pieces of nude fabric are often the extent of it. ‘They need a barrier between them that’s not just a piece of cloth,’ says Alicia, who has commissioned garments made with robust padding, ‘so that whether someone does or doesn’t get an erection, their scene partner doesn’t have to know.’ This is not uncommon; involuntary ‘vascular reactions’ are an occupational hazard, says Alicia – and they haven’t generally been discouraged. ‘If anything, actors are told to “feel it” when they are performing,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To avoid such situations, Alicia acts as an intermediary between actors, directors and producers, negotiating the exact terms of each sex scene, from the amount of nudity to particular moves. ‘For example,’ she says, ‘the rider [contract] for a single scene will say: “Player A agrees to simulate oral sex, on her knees, to a male actor. For absence of doubt, there will be no nudity.”’ (No, it isn’t very sexy at all when you break it down like that.) If an actor is unhappy with anything, Alicia will give them the confidence to say ‘no’ and help them find a solution.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘So many people outside the industry say to me, “Oh, I thought they just had sex,”’ she says, rolling her eyes. In fact, that steamy-looking spontaneous clinch was probably created in a draughty studio, surrounded by a dozen crew members, repeating a motion for multiple takes. Actors have long made no secret of the discomfort and cringe-inducing grind (no pun intended) of filming sex scenes. Roger Moore is said to have told his co-stars, ‘I want to apologise now if I get an erection… And if I don’t.’ After filming Gone Girl, Rosamund Pike said of her sex scene with Neil Patrick Harris: ‘You’re with a man who’s not your husband who also has a husband. He’s in his underwear, you’re in your underwear, and you’re dry humping on a bed.’ Jennifer Lawrence has said she was guilt-ridden by the prospect of a sex scene with the then married Chris Pratt for 2016’s Passengers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> Actress Emily Meade knew something had to change. After securing the role of Lori, a prostitute-turned-rising porn star in The Deuce, she balked at the prospect of performing X-rated scenes on a daily basis. ‘The idea of playing such a role every week with little preparation, which is the nature of TV, was very anxiety-provoking for me,’ she’s said. Taking this on board, the channel hired Alicia, who helped Emily build intimacy and trust with her co-star. She performed eye-to-eye contact exercises and ‘consensual hand touching’ – when one person takes the other’s hand and places it where it will be on their body during the scene. ‘It turned out to be easy and comfortable,’ Emily said, joking that she wished Alicia could accompany her on all of her dates.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alicia has spent much of her career performing and coordinating stunt work, mainly in theatre and independent film, and the parallels are close, she says: both sex scenes and fight scenes have to appear realistic and natural. But whereas ‘nobody would tell two actors to just start punching each other’, she says, in sex scenes, historically, directors have done exactly that. In the absence of input or direction, actors are forced to simulate what they would do in real life. Which, when you think about it, is a bit weird: thrusting against a colleague for take after take would likely make the boldest of us blush.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the outcomes haven’t always been positive. Alicia estimates that 90 per cent of performers who have played a sex scene have had some sort of traumatic experience arising from it. ‘Actors and actresses experience a whole spectrum of emotions, from feeling uncomfortable to shame because an incident was never talked about,’ she says. There are potentially serious and damaging incidents, too. ‘I know of situations in which a director has told an actor to “just keep going”, and an actress has been sexually assaulted,’ she says.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-2639a7c0-1033-11e9-81cd-f1b6e0f2f67e">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> I know of situations in which a director has told an actor to “keep going”, and an actress has been sexually assaulted</div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The subject has been brought into sharp relief recently by the rise of the #MeToo movement, the campaign against sexual assault that emerged in late 2017. Practices which, in the past, might have been overlooked or even deemed ‘just what you have to do’ – by women as well as men – are no longer acceptable. On set now, Alicia has firm rules when asking an actor or actress for their consent to take part in a certain scene. ‘“Maybe” is a no, “sure” is a no,’ she says. ‘Only if they can look me in the eye and give me an enthusiastic “yes” are we good to go.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alicia grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, and began acting in local productions at the age of 12. She studied drama at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, where she did a lot of fight scenes that led her into stunt work in theatre and film. She’s not just talking about bar brawls or jumping out of windows, though. ‘I kept being called to help with sexual assault and rape scenes,’ she says, ‘and I realised there were no protocols.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2016 she and two other acting/movement teachers founded the not-for-profit Intimacy Directors International to establish standards for intimate scenes in theatre, film and TV, and to help implement them. Their guidelines and techniques are drawn not only from stunt work but from less obvious avenues, too. ‘I borrowed from people who work in the swinging world, hosting sex parties,’ she says. One hostess told her about a game that helps people practise asking an uncomfortable question, and saying no to it. Attendees all write a sexual act on a piece of paper and place it in a bowl. Everyone has to read one out, asking another member of the group if they will engage in that particular act; the other person must say no. Alicia plays the same games with the actors she works with, ‘just to get them to practise saying no – it’s amazing how hard people find it’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unsurprisingly, as Hollywood strives to make up for decades of lapsed regulations protecting its performers, Alicia is very much in demand. She is now contracted exclusively to HBO, working on the bachelor comedy Crashing, new drama Watchmen and the film of the Western TV series Deadwood. Fortunately, as well as the five intimacy coordinators on Intimacy Directors International’s books, Alicia is training a further 12 people around the US.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ultimately, she hopes to see the industry demand that every sex-scene set employs an intimacy coordinator as they would a stunt team. ‘Actors are at work,’ she says, ‘and they need to have the same rights and protections that anyone else would expect to have at work.’</p><div class="item">

Disturbingly, director Bernardo Bertolucci reasoned that he wanted her to react ‘as a girl, not as an actress’. Maria, who died in 2011, has admitted she felt ‘humiliated and, to be honest… a little raped, both by Marlon and by Bertolucci’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Straw Dogs</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">British actress Susan George says the director of 1971’s Straw Dogs, Sam Peckinpah, wanted her to have sex for real in the film’s controversial double rape scene. ‘He wanted it to be utterly explicit,’ says Susan. ‘He would have loved the real action. He really got into this rape scene, and it terrified me.’ Finally, after she threatened to quit, Peckinpah agreed to tone things down, letting the camera linger on her face rather than her body.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Frida</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Salma Hayek alleges that producer Harvey Weinstein forced her to film a nude lesbian sex scene in Frida, the 2002 biopic of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, telling her that if she didn’t do a full frontal sex scene with her co-star Ashley Judd, he would cancel the movie. The actress, now 52, says she shook uncontrollably during filming, crying and vomiting repeatedly, and she had to take a tranquilliser to enable her to do it.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>Enter Alicia Rodis, the world’s first intimacy coordinator, on hand to guide A-listers through the awkwardness not to mention the potential lawsuits.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Whether you are an experimental tween taking your first tentative style savvy step or a full-blown Carrie Bradshaw print-clashing professional, New York City is a mecca for all fashionistas. Fresh from their recent trip, the YOU fashion team shares their top recommendations for the Big Apple to ensure you make the most of your trip.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>THE JOURNEY</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No matter how long your stay in New York, the ‘city that never sleeps’, it will never be enough. So you need to be ready to hit the ground running, we recommend you try to catch as many mile high zzz’s as you can. To make your slumber so much easier, <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/british_airways/index.html" id="mol-1fbe45f0-140b-11e9-a20c-ab4b0918cf31">British Airways</a> have thoughtfully paired with YOU mag favourite, The White Company, as part of their Club World experience on all flights between  Heathrow and JFK. Sink into your sumptuous bedding which includes a super soft blanket with satin trim (fashion points tick) and rummage through The White Company amenity kit wash bag that you will find waiting for you. The specially selected products from the brands cult Restore and Relax Spa collection will ensure you land looking catwalk ready. Those sidewalks won’t know what’s hit them.</p><img id="i-a7eef9452b8a4324" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8309986-0-image-a-1_1547036694303.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The British Airways collaborate with the White Company makes sky high snoozing all the more appealing" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Flights to New York start from £256 return. Visit <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://ba.com/">ba.com</a> to book.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHERE TO STAY</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It goes without saying all fashionistas gravitate to Soho. The lower Manhattan location was in recent history a hubbub of artist's lofts and gallery spaces and consequently the spiritual home of many of our fashion ancestors. But as the city  never sleeps, changes happen quickly, and due to its rising popularity and the consequential rental costs, Soho is now perhaps better known for its luxury shopping stores (tick) and new restaurant openings (double tick). The cool kids may not be able to afford to live here anymore, but they still return in their droves to enjoy the creative meeting place of cutting-edge style and luxury.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When it comes to where to stay, we always head directly to 11 Howard, perfectly poised on the corner of the trend setting Lafayette Street. Its design artfully nods to New York’s heritage in all things raw and industrial whilst adding timeless luxury finishes and warmth through its carefully curated interiors. The Broadway-inspired marquee lights announce your arrival, where you are met warmly by the concierge team. Should you not be feeling so friendly, you can do all your checking in and out, luggage and room service requests by their technology platform on your mobile or convenient in-room tablets. You will be busy continually updating your Instagram anyway so it makes sense.</p><img id="i-dd42be28ba37c1a0" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8309982-0-image-a-2_1547036703782.jpg" height="344" width="634" alt="A rather grand entrance at 11 Howard, New York " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Library offers the perfect socialising space on the second floor, be it for breakfast or post-dinner cocktails. The sun-drenched space offers a plethora of uniquely designed pieces from the likes of SPACE Copenhagen, Rick Owens and a roll call of who’s who in the interiors world. Sadly the pieces are all too large to fit in your suitcase and take with you, but they are a fantastic source of inspiration none the less.</p><img id="i-ff772ff3c8ebfabc" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8309978-0-image-a-3_1547036711611.jpg" height="475" width="634" alt="Fashionista-approved interiors at 11 Howard, New York" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s unsurprising to learn the mastermind behind the hotels aesthetic is one of our own, fashion designer Serkan Sarier, best known for her pared-back luxury with polished urban highlights. Each of the 221 guest rooms boast 11-foot-high ceilings and oversized windows for abundant natural light and all the cityscape views you could hope for.</p><img id="i-a867baf39cfbf797" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8309980-0-image-a-4_1547036716016.jpg" height="846" width="634" alt="The Jeff Koons led mural at 11 Howard" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Adding to its all-star role call renowned contemporary artist Jeff Koons mentored a home-grown youth group to create the locally inspired mural on the buildings South-facing wall. Designed to showcase the history and culture of Soho and encourage you to stroll through its winding side streets, it makes quite the welcome statement to an already vibrant area.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://11howard.com/">11howard.com</a></p><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHAT TO SEE</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sightseeing is never passé and whether it’s your first or your hundredth trip, I can assure you that you will never stop getting chills when you set eyes on the iconic Statue of Liberty.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By far the best (and cheapest) way to do it is to buy a CityPASS, they have vetted the top must-see attractions, allowing you VIP queue jump entrance, whilst saving you a whopping 42% on regular admission. You can use the money and time you save indulging in some stateside shopping, but more on that later. Some of the sites included in CityPASS are The Empire State Building, American Museum of Natural History, Top of the Rock, 9/11 Memorial and Statue of Liberty. Valid for 9 days, it means you can take the sights at your own speed. Back on the fashion trail, also included is the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art, another must visit, and home to some incredible fashion-led exhibits and the  venue of the MET Ball every year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">New York CityPASS ticket booklet, $126 for adults and $104 for youths aged 6-17. <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.citypass.com/new-york">citypass.com/new-york</a></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHERE TO EAT</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any true fashion crowd knows that at least 60 per cent of your party will be vegan and luckily New York has some of the best vegan restaurants to choose from. The ironically named Butcher's Daughter (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thebutchersdaughter.com/">thebutchersdaughter.com</a>) has an extensive vegetarian and vegan menu in a relaxed and warm setting. If you are feeling less saintly, but of course want to stick to your vegan scruples, check out the much instagrammed by CHLOE (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://eatbychloe.com/">eatbychloe.com</a>) in Soho for vegan-friendly junk food - just be prepared for crowds and significant wait. Junk food it may be, but fast food it ain’t. If Mexican is the flavour of the day, head to Chinatown and check out Jajaja (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jajajamexicana.com/">jajajamexicana.com</a>) for food so good you want every day of the week to be #vegantacotuesday. Those looking for the best meat and fish tacos in town, head to Tacombi (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://tacombi.com/">tacombi.com</a>). Either options are perfectly washed down with glass (or two) of mescal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After a night of perhaps too many cocktails, I would recommend taking a brisk walk over Brooklyn Bridge to blow away the cobwebs and explore the hipster mecca that is Brooklyn. I am sure everyone is familiar with the hangover-curing abilities of the humble pizza. But nothing can describe the magical qualities of the best pizza I have ever tasted at Grimaldis (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.grimaldispizzeria.com/">grimaldispizzeria.com</a>). Once you have worked up an appetite from wandering, follow the crowds, it’s worth the hype (and unfortunately the queue), you can thank me later.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHERE TO SHOP</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course we understand that exchange rates aren’t what they once were, therefore making the savings on shopping trips a little less ludicrous. But buying some of our favourite US brands on home soil still offer worthy discounts and lines that are unavailable to us in the UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brands on our hitlist this season include Free People, Reformation, Kate Spade, J Crew and Cat Bird for all our jewellery wants. Be sure to hit the classic department stores Bloomingdales, Macy’s and Saks Fifth Avenue for the colossal consumer experience. Your wardrobes will thank us, your bank account less so.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><br /></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>Whether you are an experimental tween taking your first tentative style savvy step or a full blown Carrie Bradshaw print-clashing professional, New York City is a mecca for all fashionistas.

So you get exploratory titles such as ‘Schoenberg meets Sufjan Stevens’ and ‘Stairway To Hell’, which sets out to find whether the devil has inspired the best tunes. If you think you don’t like classical music, this is a good place to meet your preconceptions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Cowan’s Classics</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Classic FM, Saturdays, 7pm</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rob Cowan is the best straight music broadcaster in the UK, because he knows how to tell you something about the music without lapsing into the preachiness that all too often kills the simple enjoyment of music stone dead.

Whether it’s Ed Balls fronting songs from the shows, Mark Kermode curating soundtrack classics or Shirley Ballas introducing music for dancing, this programme takes the live music experience up and down the country, proving week after week that the actual sound of a live orchestra can be a surprisingly bracing listen.</p><div>

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Soul Music</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">BBC Radio 4, Wednesdays, 9am</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Described as a series about ‘music with a powerful emotional impact’, Soul Music is the kind of simple premise that could go on for ever. In tying together the musicians’ story of how a song came to be created with the listeners’ story of how it came to help them through trying times, it proves that, whether you’re talking about Jerusalem or Shine On You Crazy Diamond, the minute music is released it takes on a life of its own.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>It’s good to talk</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eddie Mair</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">LBC, weekdays at 4pm</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At a time when the public discourse seems to have been hijacked by angry cab drivers who just want you to know how cross they are, it’s a relief that the bloke in the back of the cab is the emollient Mair, who interrupts as little as possible when callers are saying something worth hearing, but can slide in the stiletto so silently his victims are unaware until it is tickling their ribcage... ‘All presidents resent the press, but they don’t call them “the enemy of the people”, do they?’ ‘Well, I agree, that’s a little aggressive.’ (Quietly.) ‘A little?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Stephen Nolan</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">BBC 5 Live, Fridays (10pm), Saturdays (9pm) and Sundays (10pm)</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In almost every edition of Nolan’s late-night show there’s a moment when he quizzes somebody who argues, for instance, that a pain-free Brexit or an end to unconscious bias can be brought about through a few minor tweaks to the law. You can hear Nolan’s benign scepticism in his very breathing, even in the moments when he isn’t actually talking.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The Frank Skinner Show</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Absolute Radio, Saturdays, 8am</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those who find Danny Baker’s 5 Live Saturday morning show  a little too peppy and metropolitan run instead into the arms of Skinner’s alternative, which is as charmingly downbeat as its presenter. He co-presents with comedians Emily Dean and Alun Cochrane, and the trio find the funny in the week’s news as well as their own lives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Political Thinking With Nick Robinson</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">BBC Radio 4, episodes at <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://bbc.co.uk/">bbc.co.uk</a></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Robinson’s achievement is that he understands that politicians are trying to do the right thing in a world that often prefers them to do the expedient thing. His in-depth conversations with the players does them the courtesy of allowing them to explain themselves and, more surprisingly, allowing them to be believed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The Danny Baker Show</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">BBC Radio 5 Live, Saturdays, 9am</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the past year Baker has been selling tickets up and down the country on the basis of his ability to get on stage and talk about life, the universe and everything. Nobody else on British radio could claim to do that. The ‘sausage sandwich game’, in which two callers must predict the guests’ answers to three questions, the last being always which sauce they would have on their sausage sandwich, remains the game against which all other radio games are measured (and found wanting).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Radio classics</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The Archers</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">BBC Radio 4, Sunday-Friday, 7pm</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ten years after her fictional dad was flung off the roof of Lower Loxley by scriptwriters looking for a ratings boost, Lily Pargetter is showing as The Archers’ most interesting character in years.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The curious thing about Jo Whiley, the veteran DJ whose voice is the soundtrack to millions of lives, is that she herself is a sucker for silence. Whether she’s lacing her trainers to go for a run or digging in her Northamptonshire garden, she doesn’t listen to music or even fire up a podcast. ‘I just like playing things to other people,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whiley uses these quiet times to empty her head. Given the tumultuous year she’s had, it’s proved a vital skill. In May, Whiley became the face of the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/bbc/index.html" id="mol-4dcfea20-1596-11e9-a203-5d5ea0f8ce97" class="class">BBC</a>’s move to modernise Radio 2, the nation’s favourite station. But her new job, as co-host alongside Drivetime star Simon Mayo on a revamped afternoon show, saw her lambasted by critics and trolled by listeners. They accused Whiley of being there just to fulfil BBC diversity targets, destroying a much-loved programme in the process. The mutiny by middle-aged middle England was awful to behold.</p><div class="item">

There was this wall of resistance to me from a very vocal bunch of people. It was hurtful, insulting. It made me look at who I am not just as a broadcaster but as a person. It made me reassess everything. It’s too easy to hate these days, to forget there’s someone just doing their thing, on the receiving end of such hostility. And it was relentless, every hour of every day. No matter how tough and resilient you are, that chips away at you.’</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whiley was on holiday in Cornwall when the noise finally became intolerable. She had recently recorded an essay for Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour about careers for women in the music industry, thinking about the prospects of the generation that includes her daughters India, 26, and Coco, ten, with whom she was at that moment enjoying breakfast. But the online response was ‘particularly savage’ (her words), with commentators telling her to ‘take a long hard look at yourself’, ‘steaming in to a show that was great’, ‘just because you are a woman, being given that’, ‘using your sex to get your new position’. ‘Invariably the criticism was from women,’ she says. ‘It was the most disappointing thing in the world.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She’d suffered a three-month campaign of abuse by then. ‘I was tearful quite a lot of the time. Some days it was hard to walk out of my front door, let alone present a radio show. I would go on Twitter to tell listeners about a great interview coming up and be bombarded with people being vicious.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there was something about this new onslaught that gave her the backbone to stop accepting the judgment of others and start groping for what was left of her self-confidence.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS event" data-version="2" id="mol-d0109990-1595-11e9-a203-5d5ea0f8ce97">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">THREE OF JO'S FAVOURITE SHOWS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Breakfast with Greg James </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Radio 1 </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Greg comes up with genius ideas and is killing it on the show.

There can be few people of her generation – she is 53 – who don’t automatically smile when they think of that song, and Whiley, with her unerring instinct for the right mood music, knows it’ll make her sound more upbeat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What she’s saying is she’ll talk about what happened to her – but she won’t be seen as a victim.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the past she’s presented both daytime and evening programmes, but most listeners associate her with the latter. ‘I have a soothing, relaxed voice for evening and I feel I know my audience at that time,’ she says. It made her a bizarre choice for Drivetime, the bustlingly busy get-you-home show. Worse still, it was the fiefdom of Mayo, a man perfectly in tune with an audience he’d kept informed and entertained on his own for the past eight years. This had to be an example of BBC political correctness turned tone deaf, didn’t it?</p><img id="i-1dcb0c976b82d3d9" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/11/11/8397666-6577487-Jo_Whiley-a-24_1547206745354.jpg" height="412" width="306" alt="Jo Whiley" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-78b4535ff9e2d3d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/11/11/8397682-6577487-Jo_Whiley-a-25_1547206752980.jpg" height="412" width="306" alt="Jo Whiley" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">No, says Whiley (who has to, really). ‘I have my musical expertise, Simon has a broad knowledge and surely they just thought it was a good fit, that we could make a really big, fantastic show together. Maybe I was being naive but I was shocked when people said I was only there because of diversity.’</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS event" data-version="2" id="mol-27f3af30-1596-11e9-a203-5d5ea0f8ce97">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">IT'S A FACT</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first song played on Radio 1 was The Move’s Flowers In The Rain.

When I first came to Radio 2 from Radio 1 [in 2011] there was a period when I was thinking, That’s Radio 1 Jo speaking, because I don’t know who the Radio 2 Jo is yet. You speak ridiculously slowly and in a bit of a posh voice because you think that’s how you are supposed to be on Radio 2. Then you relax and become yourself. On Drivetime I didn’t know who I was for quite a long time, I didn’t know what my Drivetime voice should be. I was thinking, Am I supposed to speak in a fast, upbeat, strange way that is not really me? I was trying to pretend to be a drivetime DJ when I should have just been myself.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The controller of Radio 2, Lewis Carnie, suggested the new double-handed Drivetime needed six months to bed in. Instead that proved to be its entire lifespan and it gasped its last shortly before Christmas. Mayo quit the corporation after 31 years of hosting a national daily programme on one of its stations – though he’ll continue to present a weekly film review show on Radio 5 Live – and tomorrow Whiley starts a new Monday-Thursday, 7pm-9pm slot.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mayo was protective of Whiley, describing her as ‘exceptional’. After his departure was announced he tweeted: ‘When the show was “reconfigured” she was my first and only choice. Some of the abuse she has had has been appalling. Support for a show is one thing, assaulting the dignity of a warm-hearted and loyal friend is another.’</p><img id="i-ab410e70cc43cc8f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/11/11/8397676-6577487-Jo_Whiley-a-26_1547206761827.jpg" height="379" width="306" alt="Jo Whiley" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-eb014beea945a0b8" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/11/11/8397662-6577487-Jo_Whiley-a-27_1547206774100.jpg" height="379" width="306" alt="Jo Whiley" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘That was much appreciated,’ says Whiley. But neither broadcaster had been able to disguise their lack of chemistry or the sense that they’d been paired to address Radio 2’s gender inequality rather than for creative reasons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Change had to come to Radio 2, whose presenters were described by Radio 4’s Jane Garvey as ‘extraordinarily male, entirely pale, with big salaries’. Whiley’s partnership with Mayo was the first time in 20 years that a female DJ had presented a Radio 2 daytime show. That’s hardly representative of either the talent available or the 14.6 million listeners who tune in to the station every week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, it’s a throwback to the years Whiley was a Brighton Poly student cooking lentil curry and listening to Annie Nightingale on Radio 1, wondering where all the rest of the women were. ‘This is not before time,’ she says. ‘Radio 2 is always a decade behind, and now it’s playing catch-up.’ For the record, she does support positive discrimination. ‘In all walks of life it is important to hold people up and give them opportunities, but fundamentally you have to be able to do your job.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As well as Whiley’s return to an evening show, this year will also see Sara Cox moving to the Drivetime slot and Zoë Ball taking over Chris Evans’ breakfast show. Ball is not going to be paid as much as Evans. She has said: ‘I’m not expecting the same as him, but I have discussed fees and I’m very, very happy with what the BBC is paying.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Similarly, Whiley doesn’t view this as a gender pay gap in operation, more a reflection of the reality that the corporation’s biggest stars are paid according to their brand. Under changes to the BBC Charter, her own salary will once again be made public. Does she mind that? ‘I don’t enjoy it. Everyone should know my salary? Fair enough, bit weird.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">(Last year, according to the wage reveal she was paid between £170,000 and £179,000 for her work across the BBC, while Mayo was paid between £350,000 and £400,000 for presenting on Drivetime and his 5 Live film show.)</p><img id="i-fcf7084c9a20c51c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/11/11/8397686-6577487-Jo_Whiley-a-28_1547206783721.jpg" height="397" width="306" alt="Jo Whiley" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-8bf681dca43c3dd" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/11/11/8397678-6577487-Jo_Whiley-a-29_1547206792327.jpg" height="397" width="306" alt="Jo Whiley" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whiley’s new programme is likely to be as popular as the evening show she was happily doing this time last year (I ask if she’d like a co-host: ‘Er, no.’) It will curate Whiley’s magpie interests in music and accessible arts such as TV, theatre and film. There’ll be a book club discussing both new and classic books and she’s also launching a ‘Jo recommends’ slot, ‘to point people to fabulous box sets and TV shows and podcasts and exhibitions’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is also a new one for Whiley: fashion. She has long been nicknamed radio’s Queen of Cool, and today she’s wearing a loose-cut, silky dress by a Danish label she has just discovered and some on-trend trainers.

Right now I think I wear what’s right for a woman of my age who’s grown up with rock ’n’ roll, who’s always been a bit left of centre.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I am also setting myself new physical challenges, like doing a triathlon this year. I think women in mid-life have to make themselves feel tough and strong and invincible, they have to fortify themselves. Clothes do that and taking care of your body does that too. It gives you a real sense of self and that’s like putting on a suit of armour.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last year that was something she needed. Her other great defence against all the criticism and the trolling was her husband and their home life. ‘My family bore the brunt of it. I have a much deeper love and appreciation for my husband this year. He’s fought for me, he’s been a warrior.’</p><img id="i-6087dc6b6d5630ae" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/11/11/8397668-6577487-Jo_Whiley_s_new_programme_is_likely_to_be_as_popular_as_the_even-a-30_1547206803893.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Jo Whiley’s new programme is likely to be as popular as the evening show she was happily doing this time last year" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whiley’s husband is music industry executive Steve Morton, with whom she has four children, aged 26, 20, 17 and ten.

Whiley is a long-time campaigner and fundraiser for disabled people.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She broke into broadcasting by dabbling in local radio while at polytechnic, and became a researcher on Channel 4’s youth show The Word, before joining the BBC. By her own admission she’s had a ‘blessed’ career until these past, tumultuous few months. The worst thing she can remember happening before the Drivetime audience revolt was the day she said the C-word on air – twice. ‘I was talking about West Kent Football Club and I said it entirely differently. I was thinking, did I really say that? Then I stammered through a second go and said it again.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’ve been speaking in a BBC studio. With its grey carpet, tangle of cables and microphones, it’s hardly glamorous – but Whiley is in her element here. It’s on the airwaves that she comes alive.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Josie Rourke’s sumptuous new film, Mary Queen Of Scots, has set a cat among the historical pigeons even before it comes out. Chief among the targets for historians’ ire was the fact that in this film Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scots meet, when they never did in real life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s one of a number of ways that the film shows things that in history were only determined by letter. Elizabeth and Mary did agree to meet in York in 1562: in the film, we see Mary and her retinue en route, turning back when met by Elizabeth’s ambassador, Thomas Randolph, who tells them that the planned meeting has been postponed. In practice, Elizabeth did change her mind, and conveyed that by letter before Mary set out. But letter-writing makes for dull drama.</p><img id="i-8288babfdff8aaf7" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/11/15/8407550-6577499-image-a-51_1547222086664.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Josie Rourke’s sumptuous new film, Mary Queen Of Scots, has set a cat among the historical pigeons even before it comes out" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-1b4948bf24b99c82" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/11/16/8407812-6577499-image-m-58_1547222459488.jpg" height="644" width="634" alt="Dr Suzannah Lipscomb is a historian at the University of Roehampton and the author of books including ‘Witchcraft: A Ladybird Expert Book’" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mary Stuart was just six days old when she became Queen of Scots in 1542. In 1559, she and her husband were crowned ‘Francis and Mary, King and Queen of France, Scotland, England and Ireland’. Henry VIII had named his daughter Elizabeth in the line of succession, but he had also made her illegitimate. To Catholics, Elizabeth had no right to the English throne.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Within 18 months, Francis died. The widowed, teenage Mary Queen of Scots returned home to a Protestant Scotland determined to be declared Elizabeth I’s heir. It was Mary’s great hope that if she met Elizabeth in the flesh she could persuade her. This is where Mary Queen Of Scots picks up the story.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is much history here you can trust. Saoirse Ronan makes a good Mary: she’s young, slim and beautiful, as Mary herself was, with the same marble-like complexion and auburn hair. In much of the film, Mary speaks English with a Scottish accent; in reality, it’s more likely she would have spoken her mother tongue, Scots – a specific language distinct from Gaelic. Mary was also truly surrounded by four close womenfolk, all her own age, and all called Mary too. And Elizabeth I – played by Margot Robbie – really did get smallpox in 1562 and her face was ever after marred by the scars. To hide them, she took to wearing make-up of white lead and vinegar, glazed by egg white.</p><div class="item">

Henry, Lord Darnley, who goes on to become Mary’s second husband, was found in bed with Mary’s confidential secretary, David Rizzio. And if the blood-drenched murder victim in one scene seems a bit far-fetched, it’s not: conspirators stabbed the poor man 56 times. Even in having the two Queens meet, the movie uses a clever premise: Elizabeth says to Mary ‘No one can know we met – if you speak of it to anyone, I will deny it’, creating the possibility that they did meet but the whole thing was hushed up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What else isn’t totally accurate? We don’t know if Darnley persuaded Mary into marriage because of his skill at oral sex – historical records don’t extend to that level of detail – but we do know he was tall, charming and good-looking, and it was lust at first sight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were black Africans in Britain in the 16th century and their inclusion at court is not far-fetched, but Randolph himself wasn’t black.</p><img id="i-fdf699bf84b781e7" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/11/15/8407806-6577499-image-m-56_1547222395648.jpg" height="425" width="634" alt="While Elizabeth ages in the film, Mary does not.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps the most notable departure from the record is advancing many of the older Elizabeth’s characteristics into her early reign in order to contrast a natural, decisive and passionate Mary with a frigid, indecisive and weak Elizabeth. While Elizabeth ages in the film, Mary does not. This is, surely, because we are to imagine her as Elizabeth does: in her mind’s eye, she says, she sees ‘not an aged woman but a young resplendent queen’. In many ways, the film is Elizabeth’s fearful fantasy of what her rival was like.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Dr Suzannah Lipscomb is a historian at the University of Roehampton and the author of books including ‘Witchcraft: A Ladybird Expert Book’</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>Josie Rourke’s sumptuous new film, Mary Queen Of Scots, has set a cat among the historical pigeons even before it comes out.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="event-ccox">1. Remember how lucky you are</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Being allowed on the radio is a privilege and an honour. I cup the microphone like it’s a precious Fabergé egg each time I enter a studio to remind myself never to take such a gift for granted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="event-ccox">2. Never moan on air</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is not what radio station microphones are for. Listening to someone in a warm, comfortable radio studio moan, while the rest of the world is out there doing proper jobs for a living, is the ultimate turn-off. I used to do this because I thought it was cool. It wasn’t, it was stupid and self-indulgent.</p><img id="i-ed89180c9d41e1b9" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/11/12/8401206-6577495-image-a-46_1547211500620.jpg" height="846" width="634" alt="The best thing about hosting a breakfast show is that you get to your listeners before the rest of the world has a chance to put them off their stride" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="event-ccox">3. Make the big little and the little big</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Take a rock star and treat them like someone who has called up to request a song for their mum. Take a listener and stick them on stage in front of tens of thousands of people. I’ve done both, many times, and it always works like a dream.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="event-ccox">4. Empower the listeners</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s my job to help remind everyone that life is generally amazing. The best thing about hosting a breakfast show is that you get to your listeners before the rest of the world has a chance to put them off their stride. A positive first half-hour can subconsciously programme one’s whole being into the best state of mind for making the absolute most of another fantastic day on planet Earth.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="event-ccox">5. Be yourself, just turn up the colour and brightness knobs</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s impossible to be on the radio every day pretending to be someone who you are not. Among other things, it would drive you insane. Besides, what would be the point? My new breakfast show on Virgin has to be me, just like on the BBC, same goes for Vassos [Alexander, sports presenter] and the rest of the team who are coming with me. As the great Sir Terry Wogan said: ‘They either like you or they don’t!’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="event-ccox">6. Reflect the day… and the world</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As the world is a mirror to each of us (we see the world as we are, not as it is), the radio is the aural version of that same mirror. We wake up, we turn on the radio, we immediately have a sense of the world that awaits us.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="event-ccox">7. Be your audience</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s no coincidence that after eight years at Radio 2 I ended up being the average age of my audience – or rather, they ended up being the same age as me. Go to any popular pub or gym and see how much the staff have in common with their regulars. It’s easier to talk to people who find the same things interesting as you do, as opposed to having to pretend, which is a) exhausting, b) never going to work in the long run.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="event-ccox">8. Once you have created a backdrop of certainty, then you can afford to be spontaneous</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some mornings the world takes over and we just rip everything up and go where life is telling us we need to. Recently we have been focusing a lot on the things in life that really matter over and above the material and mental clutter that certain companies want us to become more and more addicted to. ‘Worry-free Wednesdays’ have suddenly popped up from nowhere, closely followed by ‘Guru Thursdays’ and ‘Don’t Fear The Woo Woo Fridays’.</p><img id="i-a29c19d7ea36c89b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/11/12/8401210-6577495-image-a-47_1547211504515.jpg" height="475" width="634" alt="Being allowed on the radio is a privilege and an honour. I cup the microphone like it’s a precious Fabergé egg each time I enter a studio" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="event-ccox">9. Fail to plan and you’re planning to fail</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I use a method where I draw a clock – I use a CD to draw around – and then fill in all the things that ‘have’ to happen at the corresponding times – news, travel, sport etc – and see how much time we have left for music and fun. It’s simple, and it works.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="event-ccox">10. Trust your team</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s nothing more reassuring, exciting and inspiring than being greeted with an embarrassment of riches by your team when you enter the studio. Surprise guest bookings, music exclusives, whatever it is, the more you have to play with, the less pressure, the better the flow, the more naturally and organically everything comes together. </p><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="you-ccox">Having a baby turns any woman’s life upside down, but for some mums the overwhelming emotion is not joy but regret – and a yearning for the life they had </span></strong><strong><span class="you-ccox">before giving birth. Anna Moore examines motherhood’s last taboo</span></strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Emma became pregnant at 32, everything seemed perfect, as if her life was slotting into place. She had spent her 20s having fun and following her passion, building the portfolio career she wanted as a musician, composer, conductor and teacher. She’d married at 30. Now she felt ready for the next stage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her pregnancy was a breeze – no sickness, no stress, no signs of what was to come – and her son was born on a warm spring afternoon (a water birth, no pain relief). The first few days passed in a blur of shock and emotion, but in less than a week, she became aware of a new reality.</p><img id="i-1cec8e58967cec08" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/16/7872712-6533159-Everyone_knows_that_motherhood_isn_t_easy_that_it_can_be_exhaust-a-21_1546532835100.jpg" height="508" width="634" alt="Everyone knows that motherhood isn’t easy, that it can be exhausting, emotionally draining, thankless, relentless. For most women, the rewards are worth it; not for all, though" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It was this horrible sense that I’d made a mistake,’ Emma says. ‘Instead of feeling happy or in love, as I’d expected, I just felt awkward around him, and everything – feeding, changing, bathing – was such an effort. And this feeling didn’t go away. When I remember the baby phase – at home, my husband working long days to make up for my lost income, most of my friends off enjoying their lives – my main memory is just the loneliness and the horrible, heavy sadness of it all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I remember one day putting him in a baby carrier and walking to the park,’ she continues. ‘It was a really sunny day, and strangers were smiling at me and him, but I just felt so sad, so cut off. I didn’t want to be trudging round a park in the middle of the afternoon. I wanted to be the person I used to be – but knew I never could be again. I came home, drew the curtains and cried.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Emma, this wasn’t the baby blues or postnatal depression, it was regret, pure and simple. It was knowing she’d taken the wrong path and could never go back. Even now, 14 years and another child later, she feels the same. (Once you’ve become a mother, she explains, whether you have one child, two or three, your old life is gone for ever.)</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-9d228200-09f6-11e9-8d7e-07fcaf79ce86">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> My daughter is two and every day I wish time machines were real</div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘My career never recovered,’ Emma says. ‘I’m a part-time piano teacher now – and this isn’t what I wanted.’ It’s not a simple case that more childcare or more help from her husband would have fixed this. For Emma, the shift was more fundamental.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I love my children. If anything happened to them, I’d never recover,’ she says. ‘I’ve built my life around them. But am I as happy or hopeful or fulfilled as I used to be? No. I haven’t been able to immerse myself in music, or had time to get new projects off the ground. I tried to juggle, but the children got most of me – because they deserved the best I could give. If I could have my time again, would I have children? No, I wouldn’t – even though that’s wishing them away.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s shocking to hear – especially from Emma, who has a warm relationship with her children, who seems engaged and connected around them, and proud, too (she shows me their artwork, framed on the wall alongside black-and-white family portraits).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Everyone knows that motherhood isn’t easy, that it can be exhausting, emotionally draining, thankless, relentless. For most women, the rewards are worth it; not for all, though. This may be the last taboo, but for a small – secretive – minority, motherhood feels like a mistake: if they could turn the clock back and have their time again, they’d choose not to do it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Emma is part of a small but significant movement (eight per cent of those questioned in a 2016 German study) of ‘motherhood regretters’ who admit that, had they known what they do now, they wouldn’t have brought their children into the world.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The strongest voices are online, lurking in chatrooms, on Mumsnet threads, discussion sites such as Quora or Reddit and other sites where anonymous women can speak from the heart. There’s the secret-sharing app Whisper – with posts such as ‘My daughter is four and I regret having her’ or ‘It’s not rewarding at all, it has ruined my life.’ There’s the anonymous Facebook page ‘I regret having children’, where unhappy parents express themselves, no holds barred. ‘WARNING NEVER GET PREGNANT,’ writes one typical member – a 27-year-old who is soon to be sterilised. ‘My daughter is two and every day I wish time machines were real…’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The movement is reflected in popular culture. Last year, the harrowing film The Escape saw Gemma Arterton play a young stay-at-home mum drowning in drudgery. (‘I don’t care about them. I don’t care if they finish their dinner. I don’t care if they go to school or don’t go to school. I don’t care, but I make myself care,’ she tells her husband, before buying a one-way ticket to Paris and leaving him to deal with the fallout.) On a lighter note, the BBC comedy Motherland and Netflix series The Letdown both use humour to show the gap between the dream and reality.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">German author Sarah Fischer is one of the few women who has put her name to the feeling, in her 2016 bestseller Die Mutter Glück Lüge (the mother-bliss lie). Fischer was 38 when she became pregnant six years ago – she was newly married, a writer and photographer who had travelled to 180 countries, trekked through jungles, been attacked by pirates and had won awards for her work.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She felt her first pangs of panic and regret as soon as the contractions began and describes her daughter’s baby years as ‘incontinence, boredom, weight gain, sagging breasts, depression, the end of romance, lack of sleep, dumbing down, career downturn, loss of sex drive, poverty, exhaustion and lack of fulfilment’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unsurprisingly, she got a lot of hate. ‘There were the “She is not grateful” and “She doesn’t deserve a child” comments,’ Fischer says, ‘as well as “I’m going to beat you up”, “I know where you live”, “Shame on you, I hope your child will get sick one day.” I even got death threats.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But she is glad she shared her feelings. ‘Ignoring the problem is not a solution; the issue will always be deep inside you and will only harm you if you try to bury it,’ Fischer says. ‘My main message was that you’re allowed to have such thoughts and you’re allowed to speak them out loud. As well as the criticisms, I also received around 80 emails a day from people who were suffering out there. There is definitely a shift taking place. People are beginning to realise that regretting motherhood doesn’t have anything to do with whether or not you love your child.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, regretting motherhood is not so new at all. Back in the 1940s, the world-famous British paediatrician and psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott (who coined the phrase the ‘good enough mother’) listed ‘18 reasons why a mother hates her baby’. (‘The baby is ruthless, treats her as scum, an unpaid servant, a slave…’) In the intervening years, though, the ‘downside’ of motherhood – the cost, pain and sacrifice – has been swept aside and replaced with an idealised version that’s a long way from the truth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On social media, where life is filtered and carefully curated, motherhood has been idealised to absurd ends. (Witness Beyoncé’s announcement she was expecting twins, blooming and surrounded by flowers, or almost any celebrity mother’s Instagram which might capture the one moment of a long week where the family are together and actually smiling.)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Professor Ellie Lee, director of the Centre for Parenting Culture Studies, thinks the modern era of ‘intensive mothering’ has a lot to answer for and risks leaving many women disappointed. ‘Motherhood is not going to be a source of constant joy,’ she says. ‘Having a child has become so bound up with self-fulfilment and self-expression, there’s a strong likelihood that women will end up regretting it.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pressure on mothers not only to enjoy themselves but also to get everything right has never been greater, she adds. ‘Whatever a woman does, whether she’s “succeeded” or “failed” in life, is measured by how her children are doing. It’s not surprising that women can end up experiencing motherhood as a terrible ordeal.’ (It’s interesting to note that in the past four decades, although women are more likely to have careers, the time they spend with their children has doubled.)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ruth, 50, who traded a career she loved in TV production to be a full-time mother of two, certainly found the pressure and boredom unbearable. ‘I’ve always been a perfectionist – I like to give my all,’ she says, ‘and the TV industry is not child friendly.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When her first daughter was born, Ruth didn’t just quit her job, but overhauled her life to create the perfect environment for children. ‘We moved to the countryside – although my husband stayed on in London in the week for work – where we had an orchard, a field, farms nearby. There was no crime, no pollution, no danger on the streets. For the first few years until my eldest went to school, we did crafts and nature walks and ate vegetables from the garden. And I can honestly say, I’ve never been so lonely or so unhappy.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sixteen years on, Ruth still lives in the village (she has separated from her husband) and her children are happy teenagers doing well in school. But Ruth questions whether she was meant for motherhood. ‘The long days, the monotony, that living in a tiny bubble. I’ve sat at home watching the Baftas and seen former colleagues winning awards. How can you not feel regret about that?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">London psychotherapist Wendy Bristow feels the first step, if you’re struggling with regret, is to ‘let yourself off the hook. Realise it’s perfectly normal to feel ambivalence and that there are women all over the world who feel out-and-out regret. It doesn’t mean you’re a bad mother and it doesn’t mean you don’t love your child,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Be very wary of any inner voice telling you that you “shouldn’t” feel like this, or you “should” feel like that,’ Bristow warns. ‘If you start beating yourself up, then you’ve got shame and resentment to deal with as well. Instead, be kind to those feelings, normalise them, then you can start thinking what you can do about it. Do you need more support? Who can help? Do you need to go back to work or have more time off?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘My major tip is to look after yourself, your own needs and your own feelings, rather than thinking only about what you’ve read is good for the children. If you make sure you’re fine, then the children will be, too.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Is it worth adding your name to the growing movement of online motherhood regretters? Professor Lee has doubts. ‘If it leads to practical help and advice, then great,’ she says. ‘If it’s existential angst, which ultimately means you’re spending even more time glued to sites that draw all your focus towards motherhood instead of developing other areas of life, then I’m not sure.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bristow, however, does believe that being able to admit regret is helpful – whether that’s to your partner, a trusted friend or a therapist. The singer Adele might appear to have everything but she has revealed how speaking truthfully about motherhood was a turning point. ‘I love my son more than anything,’ she admitted in one interview, ‘but on a daily basis, if I have a minute or two, I wish I could do whatever the f*** I wanted, whenever I want. Every single day I feel like that.’ When she turned to a friend, another mum, and told her she ‘hated this’, her friend burst into tears and said she hated it, too. ‘And it was done,’ Adele says. ‘It lifted.’</p><div class="item">

She was not in the least bit maternal.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Joan Crawford</strong> may have adopted five children but according to her eldest, Christina, the actress was not cut out to be a mum. In her book Mommie Dearest Christina described Joan as sadistic and abusive: ‘What my mother wanted was fans and puppies, not human beings.’</p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">What about the effect speaking the truth might have on your children? On one online group, someone has left a sharp rebuke to motherhood regretters. ‘To be honest, I saved all my sympathy for their children. My mother said this kind of s**t for years, and it’s scarring. I’ve lived my whole life trying to be as successful as possible to get her to change her mind, feeling like one of the biggest regrets of her life… If you want to talk to those close to you about this, in confidence, do so by all means. But to make these sentiments public means your children will someday read them.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sarah Fischer, though, has no such fears. She is very clear that feeling regret does not mean she loves her daughter Emma any less, and she believes it’s important to step forward, so that maybe this myth of ‘motherly bliss’ will be gone by the time Emma makes these choices for herself. ‘I even dedicated the book to my daughter because she may become a mother one day,’ says Fischer. ‘I hope it will be different by then.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">*Some names have been changed </span></p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>Having a baby turns any woman’s life upside down, but for some mums the overwhelming emotion is not joy but regret – and a yearning for the life they had before giving birth.

At the time a growing body of scientific evidence suggested this way of eating – restricting calories, albeit quite drastically, two days a week – was not only one of the most effective ways to control weight but could also help us live longer, healthier lives. The science is even more persuasive nowadays. This week I’m excited to unveil my all-new Fast 800 diet. It’s my best plan ever, based on the latest scientific findings that show the health and weight benefits of intermittent fasting along with a dietary approach that promotes rapid weight loss. Losing weight fast initially may actually help you keep it off. That may surprise you – it did me at first – but the findings add up. Now, in the Fast 800, I’ve combined the new science with everything I’ve learnt personally since my earlier books in one easy-to-follow programme.</p><img id="i-830862e47a03bf8c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/02/12/8045416-0-Avocado_cucumber_mint_shake-a-13_1546432831869.jpg" height="744" width="634" alt="Avocado, cucumber &amp; mint shake" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium"><strong>FIRST GRAB YOUR FAST 800 GUIDE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s all explained in the super-handy 32-page Fast 800 Diet Planner that comes free with today’s <span class="mol-style-italic">Mail on Sunday</span>. It’s a must-read pocket guide packed with everything you need to know about the Fast 800 approach, and how to start. I invite you to get stuck in. You’ll discover:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">✸ Why 800 calories is the magic number when it comes to successful weight loss.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">✸ How to get started with the rapid weight loss stage (800 calories per day for the first 14 days).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">✸ Why I also include the principle of Time Restricted Eating (TRE), aiming to have a 12-hour overnight fast each day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">✸ How and when to transition to the New 5:2 (800 calories for at least two days a week, with a suggested 14-hour overnight fast).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">✸ Why, in the Fast 800, I’ve decided to include meal replacement shakes as part of my plan for the first time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium"><strong>MY NEW TAKE ON SHAKES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Welcome to this bonus recipe pullout to accompany the Fast 800. It’s true that in the past I had reservations about the role of shakes in weight loss. A lot of the commercial shakes you can buy contain added sugar and they often taste artificial. But healthy, homemade, nutrient-rich shakes can be a very different matter. That’s why, despite my earlier scepticism, I think they can have a place when you are on a diet. They’re convenient, easy and can help ease your way into the Fast 800. Using 200-calorie shakes to replace the occasional meal has a number of practical benefits:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">✸ You don’t have to think too much about what to buy and cook for every meal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">✸ You have a quick and easy solution when dashing out in the morning or to take to work for lunch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">✸ You’ll be getting a decent amount of vitamins and other essential nutrients in these shakes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">✸ You’ll be consuming healthy plant-based fats which help you absorb vitamins.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">✸ You could experience a reduction in cravings: our shakes are designed to be filling and keep you satiated.</p><img id="i-62416fd9d7949e96" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/02/12/8045418-0-image-a-14_1546432945410.jpg" height="373" width="306" alt="Iced berry shake" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-c87db62a3825b38" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/02/12/8045430-0-image-a-15_1546432951257.jpg" height="373" width="306" alt="Spanish-style shake" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium"><strong>GOING THE SHAKE ROUTE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Include our shakes as part of your 800-calorie days or create your own along the same lines, aiming for something fairly low in carbs, containing plenty of protein, enough fat and decent amounts of fibre to keep you feeling full and encourage fat burning. But don’t rely wholly on homemade shakes; you need to get most of your 800 calories from wholefoods and real meals. Think of these shakes as a tool to help you kick-start the Fast 800; they certainly aren’t meant to be for ever. That’s why I recommend that even at the beginning of the Fast 800 you get most of your calories from wholefoods. If at any stage you lapse and need to get back on track, feel free to reintroduce shakes but regard them as a useful reboot rather than a way of life. Let me know how you get on.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">She reduced Hugh Grant to a stuttering wreck in Four Weddings And A Funeral and caused Bill Murray’s irascible weatherman to relive his days on an endless loop until he could win her affections in Groundhog Day. But as Andie MacDowell admits, her own romantic life isn’t quite the Hollywood fairy tale. ‘Unfortunately, I’m not dating at the moment and can’t even figure out how to begin to do that,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now 60, she has been married twice and visibly baulks at the suggestion that she might want to try a dating app. ‘Oh, heavens no!’ she exclaims. ‘It would be impossible for me because there’s so much projection about who I must be because of the job I do. And what I want at my age are great friendships.’</p><img id="i-81789d92dcea36fd" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/28/16/7905692-6520301-image-a-3_1546015255441.jpg" height="701" width="634" alt="The original Four Weddings And A Funeral saw Hugh Grant’s bumbling Charles finally win over MacDowell’s Carrie. ‘In the sequel Carrie has relaxed more over the years,’ MacDowell says" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">MacDowell was just six when her father left home. Her mother Pauline subsequently became an alcoholic and the young Andie was forced to grow up quickly. ‘I did an intervention for her when I was 17 but it failed,’ she admits. ‘I wouldn’t say I blamed myself for her disease, as I didn’t have any control over it, but I wish I could have saved her. She died when she was 53 and I was 23.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">MacDowell is best known for her work in light romantic comedies, none more so than Four Weddings And A Funeral – a short sequel to which she has just been filming in London, called One Red Nose Day And A Wedding (to be shown in next year’s Comic Relief on March 15). She says, ‘I wept seeing everyone again. We all had dinner at [writer] Richard Curtis’s house and even his life with his wife Emma is like something out of a movie. Being back with everyone was like putting on an old shoe. It fits perfectly.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The original film saw Hugh Grant’s bumbling Charles finally win over MacDowell’s Carrie. ‘In the sequel Carrie has relaxed more over the years,’ she says. But on the subject of whether Charles and Carrie are still together, she remains tight-lipped. ‘Maybe he’s with me. Maybe he’s with Kristin Scott Thomas’s Fiona. Or maybe he’s with Fiona and me.’ So, it’s going to be ‘Four Weddings And A Threesome’ then? ‘Well, she laughs, ‘you never know.’</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">MacDowell took the original job against the wishes of her manager. ‘But it was just the most beautiful script I’d ever read.’ As for Grant, he ‘wasn’t famous at the time, whereas I was – and he’d constantly tease me about it. I remember he was driving this piece of junk car because he couldn’t afford anything else. He’s probably in a Lamborghini by now.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">MacDowell has also been in the UK filming her latest project, the BBC Three comedy Cuckoo, featuring Greg Davies and Helen Baxendale as a couple who find themselves taking in a succession of odd characters. This season’s oddball is MacDowell’s glamorous Ivy Mittelfart, the wife of a billionaire US businessman. She shows up at Ken’s home and ends up staying longer than anticipated when Ivy is suddenly left penniless. ‘Inside, she’s a good person,’ says MacDowell, ‘but she’s like a creature from another planet.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When I mention Harvey Weinstein, she seems detached from the scandal. ‘I’d see Harvey at parties and I used to joke with him: “Hey Harvey, remember me?”, because after Sex, Lies, And Videotape [Weinstein’s 1989 movie] he didn’t use me again. My life was never in Hollywood. I had no clue what was going on with Harvey. I was shocked and saddened by the stories because he was someone I respected, and hearing all this ruined what was a great experience for me, working on that movie.</p><img id="i-ed7898928bc1de26" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/28/16/7905694-6520301-image-a-4_1546015259152.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt=" MacDowell has also been in the UK filming her latest project, the BBC Three comedy Cuckoo, featuring Greg Davies and Helen Baxendale" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I’ve never been the subject of inappropriate behaviour in Hollywood, but outside the business I’ve had men thinking they could touch me inappropriately or treat me as a sex object. Maybe it’s because I’m very antisocial and boring,’ she laughs. ‘I’m a very quiet person.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Men don’t seem too important for MacDowell now, however, who is so busy working ‘that I wouldn’t know how to invite anything else into my life’. She laughs. ‘I guess I don’t want a relationship bad enough.’  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">‘Cuckoo’ is on Jan 4, 10am on BBC Three, &amp; 10.35pm on BBC1</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>She's best known for her roles in iconic romantic comedies like Four Weddings And A Funeral, but at 60, Andie MacDowell says she has no interest in modern internet dating and says she is looking for friendship rather than romantic love</dc:description><dc:publisher>Event</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Lina Das</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2018-12-29T22:01:37.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Andie MacDowell on why she is looking for friendship rather than love</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-12-29T22:01:37.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/28/17/7905954-0-image-a-82_1546017154955.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/event/article-6520139/Childline-founder-Esther-Rantzen-working-hard-aged-78.html" title="'My children staged an intervention to save me': The Childline founder Esther Rantzen reveals why her family had to step in to stop her neglecting her own grandchildren"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/event/article-6520137/Richard-Hammond-risks-life-limb-new-series-Grand-Tour.html" title="'I was shaking from head to foot.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>... are you reading now?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I just re-read The Odyssey — the recent brilliant translation by Emily Wilson — while on Ithaca. I read it sitting on the very white pebbled shore on which Odysseus must have landed. Wonderful when both author and story are on the mysterious cusp of fact and fantasy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To read it there was extraordinary, surrounded by olive groves and sage-scented mountains, the goats crying like the ghosts of men and the gods looking down from the clouds, still trying to sort us out. Talked to Homer in his ruined palace and told him the ending of his great epic poem needed work. He agreed. Lovely fellow though.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>... would you take to a desert island?</strong></p><img id="i-e900439f3c8ad5d8" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/09/20/21/4436218-6190905-image-a-1_1537476019340.jpg" height="951" width="634" alt="Children's author Michael Morpurgo says he is currently re-reading The Odyssey" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">To remind me of our Devon home I would take James Ravilious’s book of glorious black-and-white photographs, The Heart Of The Country. It’s my corner of England, where clouds hang heavy over Dartmoor hills, where farmers live out their lives down deep lanes, where buzzards and larks share the sky, where herons and kingfishers fish the rivers, where sheep safely graze, where there is perfect peace.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>... gave you the reading bug?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Comics, because I loved pictures to tell the stories. I read the Classics Illustrated series a lot, and The Dandy and The Beano and The Eagle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then in the school library I came across a copy of Treasure Island and loved it. I see the pictures in my head now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And my mother, I think, helped me more than anyone else to love stories and poems. She would read to us most nights, and read only those stories and poems she loved best. Our favourite was The Elephant’s Child by Rudyard Kipling. Wish I had written that!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>... left you cold?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I never let a book leave me cold, not any more. If I am not enjoying a book, I simply don’t go on reading it. There were lots of books I was made to read at school, often when I was too young for them — or maybe I was studying them for exams. These books left me cold. It took me a while to learn to love reading for pleasure, to really lose myself in a book. So now, the moment I feel I am not enjoying a book, I close it and put it down and find one I really love. Important that — the freedom not to like a book, not to finish it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">MICHAEL MORPURGO is president of BookTrust, whose Time To Read campaign to give every child starting school in England a copy of Little Monkey by Marta Altes was launched this week (booktrust.org.uk).</span></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>Children's author Michael Morpurgo says he is currently re-reading The Odyssey and would take James Ravilious’s book of black-and-white photos, The Heart Of The Country, to a desert island.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Daily Mail Reporter</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2018-09-20T22:18:59.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>WHAT BOOK: Children's author Michael Morpurgo</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-09-20T22:18:59.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/09/20/21/4436218-0-image-a-13_1537476110287.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-6165625/Behind-formal-dress-polite-smiles-British-India-sex-mad-bloodthirsty.html" title="The riotous Raj!

<p class="mol-para-with-font">'Helen was an ex of a gay mum I knew,’ says Karen, 44. ‘We met at a child’s birthday party and spent the afternoon talking and laughing. For a few weeks afterwards, we were messaging – harmless banter, but when my phone pinged, my insides did a little dance. I was completely wired. After a few weeks, it felt too strong to push back down.’ Helen popped up at more social events, and soon the two arranged to meet on their own for a drink. ‘By the end of that evening, we were up against a wall kissing.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Within months, Karen’s life was unravelling – her marriage, friendships and family relationships: her entire identity as she’d always known it. Two years on, the dust is still settling. Karen and her husband are separating and she plans to introduce her children – both primary-school age – to Helen gradually, in her own time. For now, only those closest know about the relationship.</p><img id="i-ddbaed8390de887f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/07/05/16/3541846-5921819-image-a-40_1530804778650.jpg" height="528" width="306" alt="Cynthia Nixon and Christine Marinoni" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-92afec58e7a72fe1" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/07/05/16/3541854-5921819-image-a-41_1530804778685.jpg" height="528" width="306" alt="Eat, Pray, Love author Elizabeth Gilbert left her husband for her best friend Rayya Elias, who passed away earlier this year" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Karen still isn’t sure how to explain what happened. Nor is she comfortable with labels. ‘I’m asked, “So you’re bi?” – but no, because this is it now. I can’t see myself being with a man again,’ she says. ‘But if I’m gay, then how could I have not known for 40 years? What hurt my husband and my sister was the idea that I’d been hiding the truth – but I wasn’t. When I married, I identified as straight. My life wasn’t a lie. Maybe something that was always there just got bigger – our marriage had stopped working long before I met Helen. Finding her brought everything to the surface.’</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Switching sides’ – or crossing sexual boundaries – relatively late in life has been in the public eye more than ever recently. <span class="mol-style-italic">Eat, Pray, Love</span> author Elizabeth Gilbert is one woman who ended her marriage to her husband after falling for her best friend. <span class="mol-style-italic">Sex and the City</span>’s Cynthia Nixon had two children with her male childhood sweetheart before meeting the woman who is now her wife. She has expressed similar sentiments to Karen: ‘I never felt as though there was an unconscious part of me that woke up or that came out of the closet; there wasn’t a struggle, there wasn’t an attempt to suppress. I met this woman and I fell in love with her.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Lisa Diamond, associate professor of psychology and gender studies at the University of Utah, has spent decades studying sexual fluidity and confirms that this common assumption that all late-life lesbians must have been in the closet is not correct. ‘Maybe we prefer that explanation because the alternative is too scary for some people,’ she says. ‘It might mean that none of us knows our sexuality as much as we think. Maybe we, too, could suddenly be surprised.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So could anyone change sexual preference and hit ‘turning point’? ‘Some individuals are more fluid than others,’ says Dr Diamond. ‘But most of us are capable of change within a certain range. Sexuality isn’t rigid and fixed. We’re born with a biological, genetic influence that creates a “capacity” – but that has to be activated by life experience, your environment, how you’re raised, who you meet.’ (This flexibility doesn’t mean that a sexual attraction can be ‘programmed’ out of you, though. ‘You rarely find that a same-sex attraction will ever disappear completely,’ says Dr Diamond. ‘It seems easier to add attractions than take them away!’)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With women, there are more ‘shades of grey’ – they exhibit more variation in sexual attraction across a lifetime than men. There are many possible reasons for this. One fascinating theory aired last year by the North American Menopause Society was around ‘evolutionary adaptation’. After menopause, having a male sexual partner is no longer biologically important.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But others believe societal values are a more likely explanation. Rick Clemons is author of <span class="mol-style-italic">Frankly My Dear, I’m Gay</span>, a late bloomers’ guide to coming out (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://rickclemons.com/">rickclemons.com</a>). He believes society is simply more open to women ‘switching’. ‘For most people, two women having sex is OK,’ he says. ‘Two widows who get together late in life are community builders, it’s “sisterhood”, it’s loving and nurturing. If two divorced or widowed men decided to shack up together and have sex, the standard reaction would be, “That’s weird” or “That’s gross”. Society is less accepting.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what are the common triggers? One is simply falling in love: meeting the person who makes everything drop into place. But just about any life transition can do it. ‘Usually we’re not taking time to ask, “Where am I going?” and “What do I want?”’ says Dr Diamond. ‘Then you get divorced or your children leave home. You change jobs or move to a new city. Starting over gives you the opportunity to really think about what does and doesn’t make you happy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Sometimes, it can be as simple as meeting other women in same-sex relationships,’ Dr Diamond says. ‘That normalises them and starts you thinking – and lots of women haven’t been encouraged to think about their sexuality much before. You may get to an age where you’re more confident and less bothered by what others think.’</p><img id="i-38a34b83c574f82c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/07/05/16/3541948-5921819-image-a-47_1530804926566.jpg" height="413" width="306" alt="TV presenter Anna Richardson had been in a heterosexual relationship for 18 years when she met girlfriend Sue Perkins" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-e1f35f58b3b04d48" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/07/05/16/3541856-5921819-image-m-46_1530804921502.jpg" height="413" width="306" alt="Mary Portas with her fashion journalist wife Melanie Rickey" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">This was the case for Alice, 37, a nurse, who spent her teens and 20s in straight relationships. She was newly single after living with a man for five years when she ran into an old friend she’d not seen since school. This friend was gay, there was a mutual attraction and things moved very fast. They got married and now have a daughter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘When we met, my attitude was a little bit experimental – “let’s just see what happens”,’ says Alice. ‘But soon I realised this is what a relationship should feel like. This is how it was meant to be instead of going through the motions.’ So what had stopped her from experimenting before? ‘I’d never really contemplated anything different to what my friends were doing,’ she says. ‘Those thoughts were probably there but I wasn’t a party animal; I was busy working and I was happy. Why look for anything different?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For many midlife people, changing sexuality brings very different challenges to those of a teenager coming out. ‘By now, you’ve got a whole life connected to who you are,’ says Clemons, who coaches people struggling with this very issue. ‘When you look at the resources for people coming out, it’s all about youth. It isn’t about how to tell your spouse or support your children – or grandchildren – or manage your in-laws.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clemons is speaking from experience. He was 36 with a wife and two young children when he came out (although this was no surprise to him, as he had been hiding his sexuality for many years). ‘When someone asks me how it’s going to affect their children, my answer is that they’re going to be all right as long as the adults don’t mess it up.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This proved true for Andrea Hewitt, 51, who came out aged 44, after two marriages and with two children, 18 and 13. (There was no other woman involved, just a slow dawning, helped along by therapy and a sense of time running out.) ‘My children were brilliant,’ she says. ‘My 13-year-old son is very logical and he asked two questions: “How is this going to affect my life?” and “Why should I care who you love, Mum?”’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Andrea’s blog, A Late Life Lesbian Story, led her to found a secret Facebook support group in 2016 for women like her. It isn’t advertised and can’t be googled, but it has 1,200 members from every continent except Antarctica. ‘Many are still married and at the beginning of the path,’ says Andrea. ‘They’re asking, “Oh my God, what just happened?” and “What do I do now?”’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Seven years on, Andrea is about to marry her partner Rachel; she has quit her office job as an administrator and now works as a doula; she feels happier and freer than she has ever been before. ‘Breathing is easier,’ she says. ‘It’s as if a weight is off my shoulders and I’ve just got so much energy to be myself. I’m less afraid of living.’ Does she wish she’d done it sooner? ‘I used to – but not any more. I love my life now and everything I’ve done has helped get me to this point. So, no regrets.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Stars who’ve switched </strong></p><img id="i-307337c74cd982a0" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/07/05/16/3541840-5921819-image-m-50_1530805048295.jpg" height="273" width="306" alt="Kelly McGillis entered into a civil union with Melanie Leis (left) but they have since split" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Top Gun actress Kelly McGilli<span style="background-color: rgb(221, 221, 221);">s</span></strong> married her first husband in 1979 and her second in 1989.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Pond perfection</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic"><strong>Any water feature is good for </strong></span><span class="mol-style-italic"><strong>wildlife, says Monty Don – </strong></span><span class="mol-style-italic"><strong>but best of all is a pond with </strong></span><span class="mol-style-italic"><strong>shelter and a shallow shore</strong></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over the past two weeks we have looked at the various ways of introducing and enjoying as many different kinds of wildlife in your garden while also creating a beautiful and peaceful haven for yourself. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have mentioned the importance of including water in a garden of any size if you wish to attract the fullest range of insects, birds, amphibians and mammals as well as guaranteeing the maximum health of your plants. This week, I explain how you can go about doing that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any water in your garden, especially if it includes plants, is good for wildlife – a stagnant puddle is still a rich resource for wildlife and far better than no water at all. But there are certain features that distinguish a dedicated wildlife pond from one that is designed purely to look attractive to the human eye.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first is a beach. This should be a very gently sloping bank for at least a third of the circumference of the pond which will provide both an easy entry and a vital exit for almost any creature, from a water boatman to a thirsty hedgehog (although, as it happens, hedgehogs swim very well).</p><img id="i-2de7f536224a8dcf" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/15/4CEF6EA500000578-5808347-image-m-3_1528210155682.jpg" height="1137" width="962" alt="Monty Don revealed the importance of water in designing a garden that welcomes a variety of wildlife" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can easily do this by grading the soil under the liner so it gradually slopes up from the deepest section to one edge and then using stones, cobbles and washed grit on top of the liner to make a very shallow beach. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I also add semi-submerged stones so any animal can hop from them to the shallower area; birds also love the semi-submerged stones to land on and drink from.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The second feature is plenty of cover. While we may prefer an open expanse of water or just a few judiciously chosen water lilies, creatures of every kind will fare much better if there is a varied and dense amount of planting around and within the water, as well as stones, stumps and places where smaller animals can safely hide from predators and extreme weather.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The marginal planting is best placed in aquatic pots (you can buy these from garden centres or online) which can be filled with normal soil from the garden or aquatic compost, but which should never have standard garden compost or goodness added to them as it will release nitrates into the water which can cause problems for wildlife. The pots are then placed on the ledges you make around the edge of the pond or in very shallow areas.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Marginal plants need to have their feet in water at all times but can exist in boggy or very damp soil for a period and so tolerate rising and falling water levels. But deep-water plants, like water lilies, must always have their roots fully submerged. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Marginal plants are attractive and good for drawing in insects but also provide perfect cover for amphibians, birds and even small mammals on the water’s edge. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are a wide range of plants but I use the flowering rush, Butomus umbellatus, water plantain (Alisma plantago-aquatica), arrowhead (Sagittaria sagittifolia), Japanese iris (I. ensata) and the native flag iris (I. pseudacorus) – see the panel far right for a fuller list. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Do not plant in a thin strip but make marginal plants merge the division between land and water, not least to allow for the rise and fall of the water level.</p><img id="i-76a13eed6c39f053" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/15/4CEF6EAF00000578-5808347-image-a-5_1528210247149.jpg" height="717" width="962" alt="Monty claims creating the right environment will naturally cause animals to come. He suggests including a log floating in water to attract frogs, birds and aquatic beetles" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Around the perimeter, long grass and nettles provide good cover, as well as being fodder for the caterpillars of butterflies such as red admirals, tortoiseshells, peacocks and commas. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any roots that spread or plants that fall should be left, as cover is good for wildlife even if it looks ‘messy’ to the fastidious horticultural eye. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don’t worry about algae, duckweed or keeping your pond clear. Water tends to self-regulate and respond to weather without human help. Tidiness will always do more harm than good.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS sport" data-version="2" id="mol-37f18250-68d4-11e8-a95d-f9eb30525fad">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">WILD FACTS</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ponds support two-thirds of our native freshwater species of plants, invertebrates, mammals and amphibians</p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cover in the form of mulch, ground-cover plants such as lamium, geranium and vinca, fallen leaves and perhaps a pile of twigs or a few old logs allowed to slowly rot will encourage invertebrates and small mammals. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Above ground level, the best cover is from shrubs and hedges – especially deciduous hedges, which provide nesting places and protective perches for birds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unlike a pond created mainly for the gardener’s delight, a wildlife pond must please its occupants. Treat them like honoured guests and provide what would most make them feel relaxed and at home. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A log floating in the water and allowed to slowly decompose is perfect for aquatic beetles and I often find frogs and birds balancing on the one in my pond. Don’t worry about how many creatures are in the garden now.

It is soil that is never completely liquid and which never dries out. One of the best bog gardens I have ever seen had a layer of about 2.5cm of water over a full metre or more of mud. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Quite a few plants such as primulas, ligularias, rodgersias, hostas and Siberian irises will happily grow in a border as well as a bog – but only if the soil retains water, they have plenty of shade and, I have discovered, it gets a really good soaking in winter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many bog plants are lush, with huge leaves – Gunnera manicata, Rheum palmatum and some of the bigger hostas come to mind – and thereby create the perfect, safe environment for insects and amphibians to thrive. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If your garden has peaty soil or is particularly acidic (and, if so, the surrounding gardens will be dominated by plants like pines, rhododendrons, heathers, camellias and pieris) then you could grow carnivorous plants such as sarracenias – which eat flies and mosquitoes – outside in their natural habitat.</p><img id="i-fb7f756fe7f74c94" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/16/4CEF6ED200000578-5808347-image-m-16_1528211199153.jpg" height="1012" width="962" alt="Monty revealed plants in bogs such as dwarf bulrush T. minima (pictured) provides nectar and cover for creatures" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>HOW TO BUILD A BOG</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whatever your soil is like, making a bog is straightforward.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1 </strong>Just as you would with a pond, mark out the boggy area with sand, rope or a hosepipe. Think about how it will relate to the surrounding areas and planting. If you already have a pond or are making one, then it is probably easiest to have the two adjacent, with water from the pond spilling into the bog.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2</strong> Dig out the area to at least one spade’s depth all over. If you want larger plants such as gunneras then you will need to go down as much as 1m, but in general 60cm at its deepest and becoming gradually shallower around the edges will do fine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3 </strong>Line this with a waterproof layer. If you have offcuts from your pond lining this will do the job very well. But spent plastic sacks are also perfectly good. Puncture this lining in a number of places to allow some drainage, as you do not want the water to become stagnant. Cover the lining with a layer of gravel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4</strong> Cut a 60cm-1m length of rigid plastic piping and drill holes in it at 15cm intervals, then lay this across the base of the gravel. Block one end by folding it back on itself and tying it tightly with strong string or wire. </p><img id="i-db9a8a4c34b4e05e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/16/4CF1176700000578-5808347-image-a-59_1528214201481.jpg" height="413" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Add an elbow to the other end to join a short vertical pipe that will attach to another elbow that protrudes just above ground level, to join to a hosepipe fitting. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This will enable you to water the bog regularly, while ensuring moisture gets right down to the bottom. Spread a layer of gravel over the pipe to stop soil blocking the holes. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This drainage pipe will not be necessary if you site your bog next to a pond as it can be topped up by pond overflow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5</strong> Backfill the soil over the lining to a depth of at least 15cm at the shallowest point.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>6</strong> Cut off any excess liner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>7</strong> Saturate the bog with water either via the submerged pipe attached to a hose or with overflow from your pond. But whichever your chosen watering method, you should never let the bog dry out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Plants made for mud</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These bog plants all provide nectar for insects and cover: water avens G. rivale; meadowsweet F. ulmaria; marsh marigold C. palustris; purple loosestrife L. salicaria; dogwood C. alba; bistort P. bistorta; dwarf bulrush T. minima; cuckoo flower C. pratensis; ragged robin L. flos-cuculi; and cotton grass E. angustifolium.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-larger sport-ccox">Give a frog a home</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>You’ll be surprised how quickly your pond will be hopping with visitors, says Monty Don</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While ponds and bog gardens attract a wide range of wildlife, they are particularly important for providing a habitat for amphibians. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Frogs, toads, newts and dragonflies will breed in these wet places and in turn will predate on invertebrates such as insects and snails and help maintain the healthy balance of your garden.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although many gardeners find moving water more attractive, amphibians prefer still, even stagnant water of varying depths, from the muddy puddles of a bog to deep ponds. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In autumn most amphibians will leave the water and hibernate on land in log piles, compost heaps and in piles of stones and leaves, which reinforces the need for gardeners to avoid too much tidiness, especially in autumn and winter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some amphibians, mainly male frogs, hibernate at the bottom of ponds among the mud and sunken vegetation so don’t clean them out or dredge them. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is tempting to introduce tadpoles and adult frogs and toads to a pond but this should be resisted in case you transfer disease. Be patient; make the pond or bog garden and they will come to it astonishingly quickly.</p><img id="i-6d9c1b438a03c35" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/16/4CEF6EE700000578-5808347-image-m-19_1528211248778.jpg" height="613" width="962" alt="Monty says having frogs in your garden is a sign the eco-balance is good (Pictured: A frog closely guarding its frogspawn)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>FROGS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No creature enjoys or uses a garden pond more fully than the common frog, Rana temporaria. In return they eat slugs, caterpillars, mosquitoes and flies. Frogs can be differentiated from toads by their smooth, olive-coloured skin and longer back legs. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have lots of frogs it is a sure sign the eco-balance is good, because they breathe through their skins and are thus extra-sensitive to toxins so are among the first creatures to suffer from pollution of any kind and especially the result of using chemicals in a garden.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In spring, frogs are drawn by the smell of glycolic acid produced by algae in ponds in order to mate. Garden ponds without a fountain are ideal. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The female will lay up to 3,000 eggs, usually at the shallow edge of a pond where the water will be warmer and receive more light. Each seed-sized egg is wrapped in a globule of jelly and the spawn of several frogs will join to form a gelatinous raft on the surface of the water. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">About three weeks later these hatch into tadpoles which will live in the pond as they develop into young frogs over the summer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They leave the water about 12 weeks after hatching, sometime between mid-summer and early autumn. You will find your garden is suddenly full of small froglets, seeking out cool, shady spots. </p><img id="i-74878cdb3d153361" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/16/4CEF6E9900000578-5808347-image-a-23_1528211298766.jpg" height="797" width="962" alt="Monty revealed frogs  suffer easily from any pollution or chemicals in gardens as they breathe through their skin" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">They will not return to the water until old enough to breed, which is usually after about two years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although many tadpoles hatch out, only a tiny percentage make it to adulthood because frogs are preyed on by many fish, newts, birds and mammals and are thus an important part of the food chain. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other than hopping with extraordinary dynamism, they can and will also let out a high-pitched scream when attacked to deter predators.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>DRAGONFLIES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is extraordinary the way dragonflies appear when you make a pond in your garden. It doesn’t matter how small or simple it is, within hours a dragonfly will be zipping across it, adding a jewel-like lustre to the garden. They are drawn to the smaller flying insects attracted to a pond, which the dragonfly eats.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Larger dragonflies – as opposed to similar but slimmer damselflies – are divided into two groups: the hawkers that will spend hours on the wing patrolling a stretch of river or pond, and the darters that spend most of their time perched, then whipping out to ambush prey before returning to their perch to consume them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Very little of a dragonfly’s life is spent either hawking or darting. The female dragonfly lays her eggs on a plant in water or even directly into the water itself. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The eggs hatch into nymphs that look like a cross between shrimp and newts, scuttling about the water where they remain for up to four years, becoming larger, occasionally devouring each other and maturing.</p><img id="i-74f25eb6abdf3d87" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/16/4CEF6EF000000578-5808347-image-a-20_1528211275472.jpg" height="647" width="962" alt="Monty says dragonflies are attracted to ponds with smaller flying insects (Pictured: An emperor dragonfly)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">When fully mature, the nymph will wait for warmer weather before crawling up a plant and shedding its skin to reveal the young dragonfly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It will take about two days for the iridescence of its wings to fully emerge and then it enters into the full-time work of hunting for food for a frantic two to six months before dying.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what we see is a glorious culmination of a life spent largely under water. Hopefully our ponds will have up to four successive generations growing as nymphs, ready to emerge and shine for their glorious but brief time in the sun.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>GRASS SNAKES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some people find snakes alarming but grass snakes are beautiful, with lovely olive-green skin with diamond black markings. They are much too rare and a garden pond will attract them in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They can bite but are not venomous and if they cannot get away from you are more likely to play dead and give off a repulsive smell than attack. But you are most likely to glimpse one as it glides sinuously away into cover.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Grass snakes need to be near water and will often eat amphibians. They need a hot place to incubate their eggs – a well-made compost heap is perfect. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I often find their mushroom-like, rubbery clusters of eggs when I turn my compost, knowing their occupants – dozens of pencil-sized babies – will head off for my pond and grow into magnificent 1.5m-long adults. </p><img id="i-48005333d85165b1" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/17/4CF110B300000578-5808347-Smooth_newt-m-61_1528214695453.jpg" height="738" width="962" alt="Monty revealed newts (Pictured: Smooth newt) have been rapidly declining in the 20th century (file image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>NEWS ON NEWTS </strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The common or smooth newt, Lissotriton vulgaris, is brown with a wavy crest along its back that is grown in the breeding season. It develops front legs first then back ones (the opposite to tadpoles). Once fully formed, it moves to live in damp places on land.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The great crested newt, Triturus cristatus, is the largest in Britain and can be up to 16cm long. It has warty skin and, despite the name, the female never has a crest. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The male grows two crests in spring: one on its back and another on its tail. Adults excrete a poison from their skin warts to deter predators. They spend winter on land before moving to water in the breeding season.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Newts eat whatever they can catch – tadpoles, worms, shrimps and insects in the water and worms and slugs on dry land.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Newts need a lot of prey, as well as enough ponds and rivers.

It should also be no shallower than 40cm, which will allow room for a few plants.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can keep this on a patio or any other hard surface but you can also make a small bog garden by setting the container on a square of soil – just 30cm or so greater than the diameter of the container – and plant a hosta in each corner. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then fill the pond every week so that it overflows down into the soil, soaking the hostas and keeping the earth moist – which they will thrive in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>GETTING STARTED</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’re using a half-barrel, ideally it will not have a drainage or bung hole. If it does, bung it with cork or a piece of wood.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although barrels are intended to hold liquid, old ones are likely to leak so always line it with a waterproof membrane. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any polythene or PVC material will do the job but this is a good chance to recycle plastic sheeting or used compost bags rather than buying more plastic. Fix the lining with just enough staples around the top on the inside to hold it – the weight of the water will also hold it in place. It can be trimmed once it is filled.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cover the bottom of the liner with a layer of subsoil or aquatic compost about 8cm deep. Cover that with a layer of grit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Place a large branch or stone in the water so that birds can perch on it to drink and wash.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can now plant into this layer or rest small baskets of plants on it.

But it is not most people’s reality.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">British gardens are getting smaller and smaller – the average size fell from slightly under 17 square metres in 1983 to just 14 square metres in 2015. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In old money that means the average garden is 15 feet long by 10 feet wide, and given that many gardens are appreciably bigger than that, many are also appreciably smaller.

These important elements are long grass, water, accessible nectar-rich flowers, berries and seeds, and some cover for birds and mammals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Butterflies and bees like sunshine, so if you have a sunny aspect, roof garden or window box then this should be planted with plants rich in nectar (such as those in the panel, below right). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bees like to gorge on the same plants so they are served best by providing blocks of plants rather than a mixture with erratic flowering. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have room for one shrub then a buddleia is best for butterflies, not least because it can be pruned right to the lowest buds each spring so that it does not outgrow the limited space.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don’t forget to make the most of your available vertical space, whether it’s a wall or a fence. If it is not possible to plant directly into the ground – and many houses have a combination of drains and paving against the house walls – then most climbers can be grown in a container. </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS sport" data-version="2" id="mol-0d006170-68dd-11e8-a95d-f9eb30525fad">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">WILD FACTS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wildflower seed mixes you can buy online are perfect for a window box – or choose your own wildlife-friendly plants from our list (see right)</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Honeysuckle is excellent for a wide variety of wildlife – the flowers attract pollinating insects, including moths, the leaves provide food for caterpillars, and the berries are eaten by birds in autumn. Honeysuckle does best in light shade such as a west-facing wall but will grow in deep shade too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any late-flowering clematis such as C. viticella or C. tangutica is also ideal for a container in a limited space because it must be pruned very hard each spring – but it then produces a mass of new growth smothered in flowers from mid-summer right through until autumn.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nor should you overlook or spurn the common ivy, Hedera helix. It’s an excellent wildlife plant, providing flowers for bees as winter approaches – a time when there are few other blooms around – and really good evergreen cover for little birds such as robins and wrens, as well as insects and even roosting bats.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many tiny gardens are consumed by shade and are therefore unsuitable for the flowers that most nectar-seeking insects crave. However, there are plants that thrive in deep shade and will nurture an alternative set of creatures. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My own favourites are ferns, which can be just as happily grown in pots as in the soil, and most will relish deep, dry shade. Toads and frogs love the shelter of ferns, as do beetles and small birds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The soft shield fern, Polystichum setiferum, will grow luxuriantly in the corner of a dry, dark yard and come back year after year without any tending on your part. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But my favourite is Dryopteris filix-mas, the mature plants of which send up fronds 1m tall. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It will grow in almost any position, wet or dry, but is perhaps wasted in anything less than rather dry shade as it is one of the most resplendent of all plants for these tricky garden conditions.

All these flowers are greedily fed upon by insects at a time of year when little else is flowering.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A few years ago I helped a young couple in Stoke to transform their truly minuscule garden – it was a narrow passageway with a paved area about 2 metres square – into a little paradise. I say ‘helped’ but in truth I did little more than murmur encouragement. The work and skill was all theirs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the things that they were keen to do was to encourage insects and birds, and so they created a living roof. The concept of a living, or green, roof where plants grow naturally in very thin soil on the roof to create a little aerial garden is delightful. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, it has been quite tricky to execute. In the past I have made living roofs by building a framework and planting into it, which involves quite a lot of engineering as well as horticulture.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But our couple in Stoke simply ordered a vegetation mat – a layer of fibrous organic material with plants already sown into it – which can be cut to size and unrolled onto a roof. Once installed and given a sprinkle of water there was nothing more to be done. And it looked great.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can buy different types of these mats – ones based on grasses, others dominated by sedums and others filled with wildflowers.

The best answer is always the same – try to avoid it in the first place. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is not much short-term help but is definitely the best long-term solution. And the best way to go about this is to encourage a healthy garden rich with wildlife and self-regulating predators and therefore pests for them to feed off. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another way of putting it is that organic gardening is mostly about maintaining a healthy, self-balancing mini-ecosystem of which you are a small part. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By and large, you have very little to do as it will sort itself out. The more you interfere – and with the greatest of respect, most of us do so extremely clumsily – the more likely you are to upset that natural balance.</p><img id="i-3ffbf8e827dfcb8c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/16/4CEF6F6600000578-5808347-image-a-37_1528212639927.jpg" height="638" width="962" alt="Monty advises gardeners not to fight nature when striving for a balanced garden " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Every garden has to establish its own balance dependent upon its circumstances, and there is no one true way that fits all solutions. But there are a few key rules that will help:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">■ Accept a level of predation and disease. Perfection is unobtainable and blitzing the symptoms of problems with chemicals simply exacerbates the problem and creates a vicious cycle. If the garden is fundamentally healthy and beautiful, then tolerate and welcome life as it is lived rather than a fantasy of what it might be.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">■ Do not fight nature. You will lose. Instead, work with nature and everybody wins.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">■ Remember that you must have some pests in order to maintain a supply of predators. For example, if you want birds, beetles, hedgehogs and toads to eat your slugs then you must have some slugs at all times, to attract these predators into your garden.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">■ Accept the prevailing weather or conditions. In warm, wet weather we are bound to have lots of fungal ‘attacks’ on our plants. When plants grow quickly and have plenty of nutrients their lushness will attract aphids and other sap-suckers to feed on this extra-juicy, unnatural growth. You have to accept that some forces are bigger than you and roll with it.</p><img id="i-2fd3dc80b55446a6" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/16/4CEF6F5200000578-5808347-image-m-44_1528212861174.jpg" height="725" width="962" alt="Monty says achieving a balanced garden can take up to three years to establish (Pictured: Indian runner ducks on slug-patrol)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">■ Be patient. A healthy organic garden is one that is finely balanced according to the very specific circumstances of each plot. This can take up to three years to establish, and during that transition period there may well be radical imbalances that seem disastrous. Hang on in there...</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">■ Avoid any kind of monoculture – that is, growing one type of plant. Combinations of plants, whether floral or edible, that share the same growing situation and conditions will always be more healthy than the same plants grown in single-species units.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">■ Grow everything hard. The more you mollycoddle any plant, the less equipped it will be to resist the ravages of weather, disease or pests, so make sure you only feed plants when they are clearly ailing. At Longmeadow, our garden in Herefordshire, we never feed anything once it is planted out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">■ Grow plants that would naturally thrive in your garden, as pests are much less likely to damage them. One of the oddities of British gardening is our desire to grow exotic species from the other side of the world that loathe our climate and conditions. This is just asking for trouble!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">■ Plant small. The sooner a plant adapts to your soil ecosystem, the better it will grow both in terms of speed and health. Raise as many of your own plants as possible from seed, cuttings and division, and regard the first few growing seasons as an investment in a healthy, long-lasting future.</p><img id="i-5509d980e24b4ea6" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/16/4CEF6F5E00000578-5808347-image-m-43_1528212849341.jpg" height="738" width="962" alt="Monty advises using home-made sprays as a final measure against pests (Pictured: A ladybird eating a plant)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>But if </strong><strong>you </strong><strong>must </strong><strong>act...</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are home-made sprays that you can use as a final measure. For the record I do not use any of them and my garden is by and large very healthy!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>STINGING NETTLES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nettles are a good fertiliser and help your compost heap break down. They also attract butterflies and other beneficial insects into the garden and can be used as an insecticide. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gather 225g (8oz) young nettles and soak in a bucket of water for a week. Strain and use the liquid to control aphids on roses and the celery leaf miner. Add the mushy nettles to the compost heap.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>RHUBARB</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The oxalic acid in rhubarb leaves is a safe control agent for aphids, particularly on roses. Cut 450g (1lb) rhubarb leaves, place in an old pan with 1.1ltr (2pt) water and boil for half an hour, topping up as necessary. When cool, add 1tbsp of soap flakes dissolved in 275ml (9½fl oz) warm water. Stir and use undiluted as a spray.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>HORSETAIL TEA</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have a horsetail weed (Equisetum arvense) problem, there’s a bright side to it because an infusion of the weed makes a fungicide for control of mildew on strawberries and other crops, and checks rust on celery and celeriac. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Collect the horsetail – foliage, stems, rhizomes and all – and for each 30g (1oz) pour on 1.1ltr (2pt) hot, but not boiling, water, and leave for 24 hours. Strain the ‘tea’ and use undiluted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MILK</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The enzymes in a solution of fresh milk (no stronger than one part milk to two parts water) sprayed on plants will attack mildew. A stronger solution will result in a foul smell as the milk goes rancid.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>This week British gardening expert Monty Don (pictured left) shared advice for designing a garden that welcomes wildlife.

I am having an audience with actress Margaret Clunie, who portrays an actual lady – Harriet, Duchess of Sutherland – in ITV’s acclaimed period drama <span class="mol-style-italic">Victoria</span>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of her ‘spaniel hair’ (her words, not mine) in the show, Margaret, 30, says ruefully, ‘The ringlets are clipped in. They tried so hard in the first series to make my hair curl, but it is so pin-straight that in the second series they said, “We give up – this year, clip-ins.”’</p><img id="i-482d8da8cb210a59" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2017/12/19/11/1936146-0-image-a-16_1513683697918.jpg" height="788" width="634" alt="Margaret wears DRESS, Missoni. EARRINGS, Gillian Horsup, from Vintage Modes" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Playing the duchess can be a labour of love. ‘Wearing corsets is horrible. They are so restrictive. Now I understand why women were described as ‘becoming hysterical’ back then: it was because they couldn’t breathe, or eat!’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Margaret, a graduate of Oxford School of Drama, who hails from Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, is up to the challenge. A willowy brunette, she has an intense gaze – which she has put to good use as the brooding duchess – but this belies an easy manner and a tendency to erupt in giggles. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She has relished taking on the role of Harriet, who will next appear on our screens in tomorrow’s much-anticipated Christmas special. The drama has been a hit, attracting some five million viewers, with the first series overtaking BBC’s <span class="mol-style-italic">Poldark</span> in the coveted Sunday-night slot. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The work of writer/producer Daisy Goodwin, it takes place in the 1840s – during the early years of Queen Victoria’s reign – and chronicles the trials and tribulations, personal and political, of the young queen, her husband Prince Albert and her court, of which Margaret’s character is an integral part. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As the queen’s Mistress of the Robes – ‘which roughly translates as the person who picked out her jewellery and was in charge of doing the rotas for her ladies in waiting, like a 19th-century version of a Google calendar’ – Harriet was ‘basically, her right-hand woman’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Margaret admits to having had ‘a shaky grasp’ of that period of history. ‘I think I learned about it at school when I was 11.’ </p><img id="i-3b29272dde46a5d7" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2017/12/19/11/1936142-0-_I_would_have_loved_being_a_Victorian_the_slower_pace_and_lack_o-a-23_1513684371914.jpg" height="788" width="634" alt="'I would have loved being a Victorian – the slower pace and lack of social media would be bliss,' says Margaret.

RING, Amrapali" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">She has since brushed up on her knowledge. ‘I would have liked being a Victorian – taking life at a slower pace and the lack of social media would be blissful. I love writing letters. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also, the high glamour of the era: everything was an occasion and people really made an effort; now, if you’re going out you just throw on jeans and text to say you’ll be ten minutes late.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She particularly enjoyed ‘delving into’ the character of the duchess – ‘a force of nature and lifelong friend of the queen who had a super-glamorous life; she was close to [Prime Minister] Gladstone, hosted diplomats and lived in beautiful homes’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harriet has been a hit with viewers, with part of her screen appeal owing to the forbidden romance that plays out between her and Prince Albert’s elder brother Ernest, ‘a bad boy with a heart of gold’. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is this smouldering love affair that has, in my opinion, made the drama so gripping. Can Margaret see the attraction of naughty Ernest, as compared to the more serious Prince Albert? ‘Totally! I would go for the bad boy every time – they’re the most exciting,’ she laughs. ‘I think if you’re a charmer, you go very far in life.’</p><img id="i-36467ba811dc8be6" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2017/12/19/11/1936148-0-image-a-19_1513684126895.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="Margaret with Jenna Coleman as Queen Victoria in ITV's Victoria" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harriet and Ernest’s relationship was left on a knife-edge at the end of the second series: she escaped the court to get away from the heat of their attraction, then returned as a widow after her – dull – husband, the Duke of Sutherland, was killed in a riding accident. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ernest planned to propose to her, until he discovered that the syphilis he thought he had cured (with mercury vapours) had returned, and so he jilted her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> ‘I really feel for Harriet,’ says Margaret. ‘Her marriage wasn’t satisfying, but she had to stick with it [although the attraction between her and Ernest was potent enough to be noticed by Prince Albert and others]. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s pretty ballsy that she dared to want happiness, an outrageous concept for a woman in Victorian times. It was hard not to think [before the duke died], “Just divorce him.” We are so lucky to live in an age where you are allowed to make changes.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This tangled romance is set to take centre stage in the Christmas special, with the storyline continuing six months on from where we left off. Margaret is careful not to divulge too much. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She offers that ‘there will be everything you would hope for from a big Victorian Christmas: ice skating, lots of children and the most beautiful trees, eight massive ones, all decorated with exquisite handmade ornaments; there’s an amazing scene where they do the big reveal’. </p><img id="i-a69aefc1fe9bd349" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2017/12/19/11/1936150-0-image-m-21_1513684183236.jpg" height="441" width="634" alt="Margaret as Harriet, Duchess of Sutherland with David Oakes in ITV's Victoria" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">(This is only fitting, as Victoria and Albert are credited with popularising the tradition of Christmas trees, along with other festive touches.) </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Something tells me, though, that the episode won’t be all yuletide cheer. Margaret nods. ‘There’s a bit of everything, joy and sorrow. Poor Harriet has quite an up and down Christmas; she’s humiliated, broken-hearted and pretty annoyed with Ernest. It’s fraught. They do get a bit saucy. But even back then, the physical side of a relationship mattered – and he has syphilis, so it will be difficult.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Margaret concedes that this love story may be only loosely based on historical fact. ‘I’m not sure what really happened or how many times they met.’ But she thinks that Goodwin’s storyline was a stroke of genius. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Every show needs a scandalous romance. That slow, forbidden love is so much fun to film. Everything is unsaid and implied. There’s so much delicious subtext. People used to communicate feelings that could not be voiced by touching their wrists. Nowadays, everything is so unsubtle and it all plays out on social media. There is something so alluring about how it all bubbled away beneath the surface back then. My favourite scene is where Harriet is practising archery and Ernest comes along and delicately moves her hip, supposedly to help her form. It is so sexy.’</p><img id="i-2a64f81c6f2c8508" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2017/12/19/11/1936144-0-image-a-22_1513684245297.jpg" height="788" width="634" alt="'There will be everything you would hope for from a big Victorian Christmas,' says Margaret.

Knots Rugs, Silk Lines in Blush" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s also a lot of highly charged piano duet playing, though Margaret admits, ‘We have a fake piano where you press the keys but no sound comes out. Thank goodness, as I never got further than grade one.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Off screen, Margaret has a close friendship with actor David Oakes who plays Ernest. ‘He is lovely. We worked together three years ago on<span class="mol-style-italic"> Endeavour</span> [a detective drama and prequel to the popular series Inspector Morse]. When he got the part of Ernest, after I had been cast, he rang to tell me and I was whooping with excitement.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The atmosphere among the cast is jolly, with filming in Yorkshire for six months a year. ‘We stay in a lovely hotel in Harrogate and have a set in an aircraft hangar nearby. It is like boarding school; the hotel lobby is our common room.’ (Margaret attended an independent girls’ school where she boarded in her final year.) </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I loved it and now I have that experience all over again. We have great restaurants and Turkish baths where we go in our free time, though mostly we just sit around drinking endless cups of tea and coffee.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jenna Coleman (who plays Victoria) is ‘lovely and always carries delicious snacks which makes her very popular on set, where everything revolves around eating. She is very petite – and I am quite tall – so we make a funny pair. The first time my dad saw me on the show he rang to ask why I was standing on a box. I wasn’t – I was just standing next to Jenna.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> She insists that actor Tom Hughes, who plays Prince Albert, and is Jenna’s real-life boyfriend, is nothing like his on-screen alter ego. ‘Albert is serious and intense, but Tom is hilarious.’ She is full of praise for Rufus Sewell (Lord Melbourne). ‘You learn so much by watching him – he can portray an entire emotion just by twitching one corner of his mouth.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And Dame Diana Rigg (Duchess of Buccleuch) is ‘brilliant. She recites random poetry off by heart, tells us all what to do and then says, “You’re welcome, darling.”’ Nell Hudson, who plays Victoria’s dresser Miss Skerrett, was already a ‘great friend’ from drama school. ‘When we aren’t filming, we text each other constantly – we have a very active WhatsApp group.’ </p><img id="i-ee4d9d774a83da54" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2017/12/19/11/1936152-0-image-a-24_1513684538921.jpg" height="949" width="634" alt="Margaret and Jenna Coleman on the front row at Emilia Wickstead in September" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The set is also rife with pranks; in one notable episode where the Victorians dealt with a rat epidemic, 25 live rats were brought on set and one joker started a rumour that only 24 had been rounded up at the end. ‘For days, I was visualising their horrid pointy noses and having nightmares. Thankfully, it turned out to be a big lie, which someone thought was funny.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like Victoria and Albert, Margaret is blissfully newlywed herself, having married her beau of nine years, musician Tom Bull, in December last year. It was a Christmas-themed London wedding; she wore an off-the-shoulder gown ‘with a sparkly thread running through’, custom-made for her by the fashion label Eponine, for whom she has modelled. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I totally relate to how in love Victoria and Albert were,’ she gushes. ‘No one tells you what a thrill it is when you get home from honeymoon and it hits you.’ But while Victoria can’t bear to be parted from Albert, Margaret has not found her filming schedule – and the weeks spent up north – an issue. As a fellow creative, Tom ‘gets it’, and she returns to their South London home most weekends. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘FaceTime is key. We are very supportive of each other. Neither of us has ever done the nine to five, so this is our normal. If Tom’s band has a gig on a Saturday night, I’ll think, “Great, I can hang out with the girls.”’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the pair are together, they ‘do fun creative stuff’, such as going to the theatre and cinema and cooking together. ‘I’m working my way through the <span class="mol-style-italic">River Cafe Cook Book</span>. My next goal is to make homemade pasta.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For her recent 30th birthday, Tom treated her to a night at Cliveden, the famously grand country house hotel where the real Duchess of Sutherland lived for a time. ‘We stayed in the Sutherland Suite and they made a big fuss of us; it was so spoiling. There’s an amazing painting of Harriet in the restaurant.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Margaret had a happy, straightforward upbringing. She has an elder sister, Alex, who works in the art world – ‘she produces amazing light installations’ – though neither of her parents is creative. ‘I don’t know where our passions for art and drama came from. I can’t say they encouraged it, though they are very proud. My dad is retired – he worked as a consultant and mum was a medical secretary.’ As a child, Margaret was ‘always in all the school plays and choirs’. </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS home" data-version="2" id="mol-c6913220-e4b4-11e7-8683-f747c9e74082">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">MUSTS FOR MARGARET </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Motto</strong> Fail to prepare, prepare to fail.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Signature dish</strong> I try to be healthy, but I make a mean macaroni cheese with extra bacon.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Fitness</strong> I hate the gym; I’m more about getting in the bath with a glass of wine.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The writer of a new book about the comedy pair explains how their multiple marriages were crazier than any of their movies</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">New Year’s Day, 1938, and the comedian Stan Laurel – one half, with Oliver Hardy, of the most beloved comedy duo the world has ever known – is snoozing in bed with his new bride. He is hung over, and possibly even still drunk, because he would not have married this woman otherwise. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her name is Vera Ivanova Shuvalova, but she usually goes by her stage name of Illeana. She is a Russian gold-digger of the worst stripe, as well as an appalling alcoholic. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She travels with a woman named Countess Sonia, who claims to be descended from Russian royalty and may or may not be Illeana’s mother. </p><img id="i-f7474ca5de7e5c9e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/11/10/4321D12B00000578-4778648-image-m-26_1502444842081.jpg" height="845" width="634" alt="While Laurel and Hardy often appeared innocent, even child-like, on screen, their personal lives were difficult, complicated and laced with tragedy" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Laurel’s introduction to these women has come through Roy Randolph, a Hollywood dancing master only recently acquitted of sexually assaulting a young actress. There is little money for Randolph in giving dancing lessons, but more in introducing his Russian friends to a movie star, especially one who is building up a track record of broken marriages. Which is how Laurel has ended up in Yuma, Arizona, married to a woman he barely knows. His head is thumping. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He thinks it may be the booze, until he opens his eyes and realises that the sound is coming from elsewhere. Someone is knocking. Someone is shouting. There are many ways in which a man might wish to be woken on his wedding night, but a voice screaming ‘Bigamist! Bigamist!’ at his hotel room door is almost certainly not one of them. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Illeana, the third Mrs Laurel, is about to meet her predecessor. While Laurel and Hardy often appeared innocent, even child-like, on screen, their personal lives were difficult, complicated and laced with tragedy. </p><img id="i-8e2236a57ccddafd" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/11/10/4321D13300000578-4778648-image-a-28_1502444893882.jpg" height="483" width="634" alt="Hardy, Laurel and Ruth Laurel in 1947.

As their lawyer, Ben Shipman, put it after their deaths: ‘Such sweet men. But oh, the problems they could get into! Particularly Stan, but Babe [Hardy’s nickname] too. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And most of it was women trouble…’ Oliver Hardy was married three times. His first wife was an older woman named Madelyn Saloshin, whom he divorced messily in 1921 in order to marry a younger actress, Myrtle Reeves. He should have been careful what he wished for. If there is such a thing as a genial alcoholic, then Myrtle Reeves wasn’t it. She spent their marriage repeatedly being committed to, and escaping from, sanatoriums. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At one point she locked herself in a hotel room and threatened to jump from a window, all in full view of police, firemen and a gaggle of newspaper reporters. Hardy did his best for Myrtle but found her alcoholism impossible to live with, and by 1929 he had commenced an affair with a divorcee named Viola Morse, who had a young son. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hardy’s relationship with Viola would persist, on and off, for a decade, until he eventually divorced Myrtle and married his third and final wife, Lucille Jones. Heartbroken at the break-up of their relationship, and depressed by the sudden death of her son, Viola took an overdose of sleeping pills and crashed her car, though she survived. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Hardy paid a high price for any sins he might have committed against his ex-wives. Madelyn returned to pursue him for money, as did an increasingly unhinged Myrtle, leaving him virtually broke by the end of his life. Even as he lay on his deathbed in August 1957, deprived of the power of speech and reduced by illness to a thin, frail figure, Myrtle tried to have legal papers served on him. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The process server she sent was so ashamed that he left the house with the papers still in his pocket. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But if Hardy’s relationships with women were complex, Stan Laurel’s were so convoluted as to be almost beyond belief. In 1919, when he was still Arthur Jefferson, he met an Australian actress, Mae Dahlberg, while working on the vaudeville circuit in the US and Canada. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mae claimed to be a widow, despite the fact that her husband Rupert was alive and well, if conveniently elsewhere. Mae became Jefferson’s common- law wife. When he changed his name, she styled herself Mae Laurel, although they never married. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mae was older than Laurel, and nowhere near as talented. When he moved to Hollywood, she came with him, but by 1925 Laurel was in love with another actress, Lois Neilson. When it became clear to everyone that Mae was holding Laurel back both in his career and his love life – to everyone, that is, except Mae – she was paid to disappear. </p><img id="i-6ce4595087291417" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/11/16/4321D13900000578-4778648-It_is_ironic_to_view_the_pair_s_films_and_see_how_often_their_ch-a-1_1502465343018.jpg" height="535" width="634" alt="It is ironic to view the pair’s films and see how often their characters are depicted in unhappy marriages, given both men's dramatic personal lives.

It’s worth going back to those early Laurel and Hardy films (many of them can be viewed online) to get an idea of just how handsome Stan Laurel was in his younger days. He had very blue eyes, and women seemed to find him irresistible. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even as he and Lois, whom he married in 1926, were expecting their first child together, Laurel had already begun an affair with a French actress, Alyce Ardell. Laurel and Lois divorced in 1934, a decision he always regretted. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even after quickly marrying Ruth Rogers, a young widow, in 1935, he continued trying to woo Lois back, which may go some way towards explaining why that second marriage lasted only two years. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The disastrous union with Illeana followed. It endured for a year, during which Ruth followed her gatecrashing of the honeymoon by repeatedly sending fire engines to the couple’s home to put out non-existent blazes in the dead of night, and Laurel dug a grave in his back yard with the stated intention of killing Illeana and burying her in it, possibly along with Countess Sonia and Roy Randolph. </p><img id="i-4608d48fbe07565" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/11/15/43297D6700000578-4778648-image-a-3_1502462881492.jpg" height="804" width="634" alt="Oliver Hardy divorced his first wife Madelyn Saloshin in 1921 in order to marry a younger actress, Myrtle Reeves.

It was clear that they’d made a mistake, but the marriage still dragged on for five years. Yet even as she was divorcing Laurel for the second time, Ruth described him to the court as a ‘swell fellow’. He just, she said, didn’t know what he wanted. Laurel’s final marriage, to another widow, Ida Raphael, lasted for almost two decades, and it was she who was beside him when he died. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He spent his last years living in a three- bedroom apartment in Santa Monica, California, writing letters, greeting fans and creating routines for his late partner that would never be performed. When he died, his old friend Buster Keaton wept uncontrollably at the funeral. ‘Chaplin wasn’t the funniest,’ Keaton said. ‘I wasn’t the funniest. Stan Laurel was the funniest.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>‘he’ by John Connolly is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton on August 24 at £16.99 </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-large">Back on the big screen... aha!</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With Steve Coogan as put-upon Stan Laurel and John C Reilly as tubby, overbearing Oliver Hardy, Stan And Ollie has an unusual take on comedy’s most famous double-act. Produced by BBC Films, the recently completed biopic focuses on a tour of Britain the bowler-hated duo mounted in 1953. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They didn’t know it yet but this was to be their swansong. The turbulent circuit of regional variety halls would unearth long-buried resentments, but also remind them what it was that bound them together. ‘It’s a love story between two guys who realise they can’t live without each other,’ explains director Jon C Baird (Filth). </p><img id="i-efcfdfc19fd05a56" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/11/15/432B856800000578-4778648-image-m-2_1502462741043.jpg" height="575" width="634" alt="With Steve Coogan as put-upon Stan Laurel and John C Reilly as tubby, overbearing Oliver Hardy, biopic Stan And Ollie has an unusual take on comedy’s most famous double-act" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In researching their story, screenwriter Jeff Pope was amazed to find little information about their off-screen lives. ‘I have not treated the boys with kid gloves or looked at them through rose-coloured specs,’ he says. For the actors it presented a big challenge. Not only embodying the deep emotional bond that made the comedy possible, but mimicking those distinctive mannerisms that made them Laurel and Hardy. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Step Brothers star Reilly’s physical transformation is uncanny, with the actor wrapped in a fat suit and given a prosthetic double chin. Coogan was always Baird’s first choice as Laurel, the ‘tortured genius’ who obsessed over the material while the laid-back Hardy was off playing golf or betting on horses. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Coogan was just as obsessed with the Lancashire-born Laurel. Says Baird, ‘He’s very serious about playing this guy. Stan Laurel was a workaholic and his life was dedicated to making people laugh. Steve understands that, he understands how difficult that is.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ian Nathan </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic"></span><strong><span class="mol-style-italic">‘Stan And Ollie’ will be released in 2018 </span></strong><span class="mol-style-italic"></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-large">Comedy's dynamic duo</span></strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> It is almost impossible for us to conceive of just how famous Laurel and Hardy were in their prime. When they travelled to England for the first time in 1932, thousands waited to greet them at Southampton docks, all whistling in unison the pair’s theme tune, Dance Of The Cuckoos. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ten thousand people crowded the streets of Birmingham to catch a glimpse of the stars. Unlike later duos such as Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, who became estranged over money, Laurel and Hardy only grew more fond of each other as the years went by. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stan Laurel would outlive Oliver Hardy – ‘Babe’ to his friends – by eight years, but he never worked again after his partner died. Laurel was born Arthur Jefferson in Ulverston, Lancashire, in 1890. He made his stage debut at the age of 16 and never looked back, eventually finding his way to the vaudeville circuit in the United States. Norvell Hardy was born in Harlem, Georgia, in 1892. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He worked as a film projectionist and a singer before finding work as a jobbing actor. Laurel was more driven, with a greater array of skills – acting, directing, writing and editing – but had never been able to find a character or role that captured the public imagination. Only when producer Hal Roach paired him with Hardy did he realise that stardom lay in sharing the limelight. So Laurel would come up with most of the gags, the situations, the stories, and the two men would bring them to life. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hardy was the better actor: his time as a projectionist had taught him that even the smallest of gestures would appear huge onscreen. Laurel, with his theatrical background, had to learn this subtlety, but there was no bitterness between them. They never argued over money, screen time or women. In fact they hardly ever argued at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong> </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong> </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong> </strong></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>New Year’s Day, 1938, and the comedian Stan Laurel – one half, with Oliver Hardy, of the most beloved comedy duo the world has ever known – is snoozing in bed with his new bride.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Post-divorce, many fathers don’t have a close relationship with their children for a variety of reasons, which can be emotionally damaging. So, asks Anna Moore, is </strong></strong><strong><strong>it worth trying to build bridges – or should </strong></strong><strong><strong>they be burned?</strong></strong></p><img id="i-30e7b03d5aed228d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/20/12/419299E600000578-0-image-a-45_1497956886232.jpg" height="676" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last year, for her 25th birthday, Emily’s father took her shopping in London’s West End, followed by dinner at the top of the Shard. Sipping cocktails as the sun set over the city, Emily remembers babbling to him about her new job, her adventures on Tinder, what her friends were up to, and thanking him every five minutes for such a fun day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One year on, she wonders whether she talked too much, or didn’t thank him enough. She had left on a high, feeling closer to him than she had for years – but months passed with no word from him, no replies to her messages. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Christmas came and went. Then he texted her from a skiing trip, promising to catch up. On her 26th birthday, she heard nothing: no card, no call, not even a text. Emily felt crushed, but not surprised. This on-off scenario has been playing out since her parents divorced when she was eight and her dad left the family home. </p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-f5eea7c0-55a6-11e7-838f-a9f483fdadf7">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox">Cutting Dad out of my life sounds melodramatic but maybe it would be a relief </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sometimes he would collect her for the weekend as arranged. More often, he failed to show up. Some promises were kept – days out, holidays, school concerts – but usually they were forgotten. Between the ages of 12 and 16, she didn’t see him at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘You’d think by now I’d be immune to the hurt. I don’t know why I still get upset,’ says Emily. It could be because her father has a second family – and dotes on his two younger children. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there’s the endless throwaway comments and hurtful comparisons burnt into her psyche over the years (that Emily ‘lacks charm’, that she can’t get away with short hair as her ‘face can’t take it’, that watching her doing ballet when she was little had been ‘hilarious’ – while his second daughter has ‘natural grace’).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘No matter what people say, or what my rational brain tells me, some part of me believes I’m not good enough and that’s why he behaves like this,’ says Emily. ‘It’s got to the point where sometimes I fantasise about cutting him out of my life – sending an email or a letter asking him never to contact me, blocking his Facebook so I can’t see his new family. It sounds melodramatic, but maybe it would be a relief.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sadly, it’s an increasingly common dilemma. Should you give up on an absent, unreliable parent or keep hoping things will get better? Build bridges or burn them? Today, one in eight separated or divorced fathers loses contact with his children, and if they start a new family, one in five loses contact with their elder children. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Almost a third of separated dads say they do not have a ‘close relationship’ with their offspring. But what happens when the children grow up? Sometimes, freed from old family dynamics, relationships can be rebuilt and might even thrive on adult terms. These are the very occasional</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">longed-for happy endings where everyone is sorry and able to start afresh. More often, though, for adult children like Emily, the relationships continue to lurch along as before. And, for some, there comes a point when it all becomes too fraught, too hurtful and too much effort to continue. But is it ever right to cut ties altogether?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It isn’t hard to find high-profile women who have cut their fathers out of their lives: Kate Hudson, Brie Larson, Christina Aguilera, Kelly Rowland and Adele have all spoken about being estranged from absent fathers. Adele’s dad, Mark Evans, returned to Wales when she was three years old, leaving Adele and her 20-year-old mum in London. </p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-f5efb930-55a6-11e7-838f-a9f483fdadf7">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox">Almost a third of separated dads say they do not have a close relationship with their offspring </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Evans’s relationship with his daughter was blighted by his alcoholism, and when she became a superstar he sold his story to a tabloid. Maybe this was the point when Adele gave up on him for good. Accepting one of her five Grammys this year, she thanked her long-time manager who she ‘loved like a dad. I don’t love my dad, that’s the thing,’ she told 25 million viewers. ‘I love you like I would love my dad.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to psychotherapist Wendy Bristow, it can take many years before you reach the point Adele has arrived at so publicly. This is because, from childhood onwards, our natural reaction is to idealise an absent parent, most often fathers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Children especially will do this to protect themselves from the pain of them not being around,’ she says. ‘If they’re not there, what does that say about them? What does it say about you? Instead of answering those horrible questions, a child will put that parent on a pedestal. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What results is this syndrome of hope when the parent steps up and disappointment when they let you down. For anyone who experiences that idealisation slowly wearing off over the years, it’s horribly painful.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a mother, Jane is seeing this play out with her two young sons, aged six and nine. While her ex-husband has always been unreliable – perhaps keeping his promises to the boys about 50 per cent of the time – since the birth of his daughter with his second wife last year, contact has dwindled to almost nothing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The boys are confused, hurt and heartbroken,’ says Jane, 39, ‘but they still adore their dad. All he needs to do is kick a ball around with them for half an hour and they come home walking taller. Then there’s no contact for weeks, sometimes months. I really don’t know what to do. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course I want them to have a good relationship with their dad – but I question this belief in “contact at all costs”. The children can suffer. Just seeing their faces when he cancels yet again leaves me in no doubt about the damage it’s doing to them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Do I cut off contact to save my sons from all the hurt, or persevere in the hope that his behaviour and attitude to them will eventually improve?’ Mothers such as Jane have to walk a very fine line, says counsellor Suzie Hayman, author of How to Have a Happy Family Life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> ‘Don’t cut off that absent parent – however tempting – and don’t criticise them,’ she cautions. ‘But you do need to be as honest as you can.’ Never make excuses for the other parent, either. You might think that it’s protecting your child from feeling unhappy, but it allows the idealisation to continue. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The children have to know that it’s not their fault, that they are lovable,’ says Hayman. ‘Tell them that their absent parent has the problem, that it’s him – or her if it’s the mother – who needs to change. Make it clear to your children not to have expectations or believe their promises.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the same time, try explaining to your ex just how much damage they are causing. ‘Tell them the consequences, that their child is hurt and it’s their fault,’ advises Hayman. When that child grows up, they are free to choose whether or not they want the relationship</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">to continue, of course. But there’s no ‘right time’ to make that decision, says Hayman. ‘It’s simply when you reach the point where you’re not going to go on hoping,’ she says. ‘It’s when you realise that beating yourself up, exposing yourself to repeated rejection, making allowances or believing excuses doesn’t make you feel better any more – and that hurtful contact is actually worse than having no contact at all.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s not a decision to be made rashly, warns Bristow. ‘And neither should it come from a desire to punish that parent or get him to change,’ she adds. ‘It’s about how it might make you feel, not how it might make your parent feel.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is where therapy is advisable. ‘You need to explore your hopes and fears around letting go,’ says Hayman. ‘You need to be clear on what you want from the parent, what they are capable of giving and whether you can accept that.’</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-9cde98f0-55a8-11e7-838f-a9f483fdadf7">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox">Explain the consequences of your parent's behaviour and also what you'd like from them </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Writing a letter may help. ‘Shining a light on your feelings allows you to see what you’re unhappy about,’ says Hayman. ‘Don’t make it a rant or a personal attack. Use “I” statements – how the relationship makes you feel – not accusatory “you” ones. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Explain the consequences of your parent’s behaviour and also what you’d like from them – even if it’s just that you would prefer to have a Christmas card every year rather than a grand gesture one year and nothing the next.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you do cut contact it’s crucial that you let your parent know. ‘Ask them not to contact you and explain that if they do you’re not going to answer,’ says Bristow. ‘Otherwise you can get caught up in the old pattern of big effort, seduction, silence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It can be liberating and empowering to draw a line and walk away,’ Bristow continues. ‘For years, the relationship may have been on the parent’s terms – turning up when they felt like it – and now you’re taking back control. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s not going to wipe away the sadness – it will just mean you won’t have the endless ups and downs and being messed about. It’s not going to make you feel good – but it might make you feel less bad.’</p><img id="i-a5f3536bd92c972c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/20/12/419298C100000578-0-image-a-46_1497956900426.jpg" height="587" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, there is an alternative – if you can manage it – a ‘middle way’. ‘It’s the hope and the wasted effort that does us harm,’ says Bristow. ‘If you can, opt for low contact: imagine yourself as being Teflon-coated then let go of all expectation of ever getting anything back; then you don’t need to deal with the guilt, drama and “what ifs” of estrangement. Some people can let go internally without having to make a clean break.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finding substitutes to fill the father-shaped hole will also help enormously, whatever path you take. Adele’s manager is one person who has helped fill that role in her life, as she made clear at the Grammys. Kate Hudson, who is estranged from her father Bill Hudson, has said that her stepfather Kurt Russell was ‘there for the hard stuff’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, as time passes, it’s possible that the estranged, uninterested parent comes knocking. ‘It could be that he has had a sea change and wants to make it up to you,’ says Bristow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> ‘Significant life events may have got him thinking – marriage, a grandchild, illness. You may want to ask yourself if he is coming from a place of regret, starting with an apology? Or is he annoyed that you don’t see things his way and thinks he deserves more?’</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-f5f31490-55a6-11e7-838f-a9f483fdadf7">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox">I told him, politely, that after so many hurts and so many years apart, I didn't want him back in my life but I wished him well </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">How you react is up to you. Alison, 38, had been estranged from her father since she was 19, when last year he got in contact via Facebook. ‘He’d been quite ill and wanted to meet,’ she says. ‘For years, when I was younger, I’d imagined that big, emotional reunion. He’d been a terrible dad – erratic, with a vile temper – then he met another woman and drifted away. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We lived in the same small town, just ten minutes from each other, but I never saw him – he couldn’t be bothered. ‘I don’t know what I was expecting when I agreed to meet, but what really surprised me was how little I felt,’ she says. ‘Dad quickly became emotional and cried, telling me how ill he’d been, how alone he felt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He never asked how I was, or how I’d coped over the years. There was no apology or explanation for walking out of my life. It was all about him – pure self-pity. I didn’t feel anything, just awkward – after all those years apart it was like a stranger telling me these things.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I have my own life now – a family, career and friends. I did it without him and I don’t need him. Afterwards, he messaged me again and I composed a reply, politely telling him that, after so many hurts and so many years, I didn’t want him back in my life but wished him well. I read it through, then pressed send.
