Large crowds lined the road outside for most of the afternoon as they waited patiently to get into the church (shown top left), with one floral tribute reading: 'The song had ended but the memories linger on' (bottom left). O'Riordan's distinctive voice filled the church as her songs were softly played throughout the service, while photographs of the singer performing and one of her with the Pope were placed along the walls. The Irish singer (inset) was found dead in a London hotel on January 15, aged 46. The public reposal is the first in a series of services to be held before the funeral mass taking place in the Church of Saint Ailbe in Ballybricken, Co Limerick, on Tuesday at 11.30am.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Alex Matthews</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-21T20:00:50.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Hundreds gather to pay tribute to Dolores O'Riordan</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-21T20:00:50.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/19/4869BBFE00000578-0-image-a-16_1516562611039.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/18/486833F300000578-0-image-a-6_1516559589054.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1146016</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>PA</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5294031/Oxford-University-extends-time-maths-help-women.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Oxford University extends time for maths and computer science exams in bid to help women get better grades "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5294271/Skiers-airlifted-safety-dramatic-helicopter-rescue.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Skiers are airlifted to safety in dramatic helicopter rescue after being stuck on 3,000ft-high ridge for 14 hours in terrifying blizzard "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5293851/Britain-freezes-coldest-night-TWO-years.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Snow hits London and floods strike in Devon after Britain freezes in coldest night for TWO years with temperatures plummeting below -13C"></link></item><item><title>The jolly hockey sticks girl (and school sweetheart) marrying Ed Sheeran: How the awkward-looking boy with a mop of orange hair fell for the pretty brunette in the year below</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5295607/The-jolly-hockey-sticks-girl-marrying-Ed-Sheeran.html?ito=rss_msn</link><pubDate>2018-01-21T23:56:40.000Z</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">{:value 5295607}</guid><description><![CDATA[Ed Sheeran and Cherry Seaborn developed a close friendship during their time at school in Framlingham, Suffolk, and some said that Ed had a crush on her - although she had a boyfriend.]]></description><body></body><dc:abstract>Ed Sheeran and Cherry Seaborn (pictured together on the left) developed a close friendship during their time at school in Framlingham, Suffolk, and some said that Ed (pictured as a child inset left) had a crush on her pictured as a child inset right) - although she had a boyfriend.

His oldest son attends a boarding prep school.  Lauer was fired from his $250million yearly gig at The Today Show in late November after he was accused of inappropriate sexual conduct in the workplace. Shortly after he released a statement saying he was 'truly sorry'.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Abigail Miller</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-22T08:48:17.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Matt Lauer's wife ‘kicks him out of family’s home’</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-22T08:48:17.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/03/486E990E00000578-0-image-a-12_1516591177290.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/03/486E995200000578-0-image-m-26_1516592259640.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5295969/James-Franco-attends-SAG-Awards-harassment-claims.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Defiant James Franco attends SAG Awards with girlfriend after being accused of sexual harassment (but dodges questions by skipping red carpet)"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5293435/Natalie-Portman-experienced-sexual-terrorism-13.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Natalie Portman tells LA Women's March she experienced 'sexual terrorism' at 13 after starring in her first film when a fan sent her a 'rape fantasy' and critics 'talked about my budding breasts'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5293653/Scarlett-Johansson-calls-James-Franco-Womens-March.html?ito=rss_msn" title="'I want my pin back': Scarlett Johansson calls out James Franco during her Women's March speech after Golden Globe winner was accused of sexual misconduct by five different women"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://pagesix.com/2018/01/21/matt-lauers-wife-kicks-him-out-of-hamptons-house/?_ga=2.10618930.748992349.1516573910-1359460367.1507284535" title="Matt Lauer’s wife kicks him out of Hamptons house | Page Six"></link></item><item><title>'I hurt him so much': Max Evans' ex-wife Katy Johnson blames herself for marriage breakdown... as the Dancing on Ice star moves on with new girlfriend Lauren Jamieson</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5294351/Max-Evans-ex-wife-blames-marriage-breakdown.html?ito=rss_msn</link><pubDate>2018-01-21T13:10:06.000Z</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">{:value 5294351}</guid><description><![CDATA[Speaking to the Sunday Mirror , the American beauty discussed how she regretted walking out on the Scottish rugby player after jetting back to Los Angeles.]]></description><body></body><dc:abstract>They confirmed their split in January 2017 after two years of marriage.

In the undated picture, which was originally posted on the social media app iFunny, Samuel Woodward, 20 (top right), can be seen smiling, standing above a friend who is on the ground with his face pressed against a yellow parking barrier.
Woodward's right foot is raised and hovering just inches above the friend's head, as if about to execute a 'curb stomp' - a violent act that results in severe facial injuries and even death in victims - which entered pop culture after being depicted in the movie American History X, which starred Edward Norton as a neo-Nazi. According to the New York Post, the photo was among those posted under Woodward's since-deleted iFunny account, 'Saboteur,' which he is said to have used to further his white supremacist and neo-Nazi ideology. Authorities say that Woodward, of Newport Beach, California, allegedly murdered his one-time high school classmate, Blaze Bernstein (bottom right) in early January.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>NY Freelance</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-21T18:44:23.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>White supremacist who 'killed gay male friend' posted 'curb stomp' pic</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-21T18:44:23.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/17/4867E13400000578-0-image-a-33_1516555328167.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/17/4867C19300000578-0-image-m-38_1516555346946.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5289595/Gay-Ivy-League-students-alleged-killer-devout-Catholic.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Former classmate accused of killing gay Ivy League student 'after they kissed' boasted about his religious beliefs on social media"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5293367/Killer-gay-Ivy-League-student-white-nationalist.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Accused killer of gay Ivy League student was a white nationalist whose posts on social media grew more disturbing over time "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://nypost.com/2018/01/20/disturbing-photo-shows-accused-ivy-league-killer-pretending-to-crush-friends-skull/" title="Photo shows ‘Ivy League killer’ pretending to crush friend’s skull | New York Post"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5289595/Gay-Ivy-League-students-alleged-killer-devout-Catholic.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Gay Ivy League student's alleged killer is devout Catholic | Daily Mail Online"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/01/17/blaze-bernstein-parents-say-killing-could-be-hate-crime-suspect-used-gay-slur/" title="Parents say killing of missing California college student could be hate crime; suspect used gay slur"></link></item><item><title>'Kisses from a little snow angel!'

But despite reapplying after getting out of the water, she claims the skin on her back erupted with massive fluid-filled blisters which needed hospital treatment – and is still scarlet three weeks later.

He was in so much agony he had to be given morphine when he arrived at Poole Hospital.

The Patriots appeared to have run out of luck as they entered the final quarter down 20-10, but two touchdowns from Danny Amendola from Brady passes saw them edge the AFC Championship game 24-20. The Jaguars - who entered the game as eight-point underdogs - looked like they might cling on to victory, until Amendola scraped over the line in with less than three minutes left on the clock. For the Jaguars the fairy tale is now over, but Brady and the Patriots will look to retain their title as they travel to Minnesota for Super Bowl LII on February 4. There they will meet either the Minnesota Vikings on their home turf, or the Philadelphia Eagles depending on the result of this evening's NFC Championship game.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>NY Freelance</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-22T06:17:08.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>New England Patriots make the Super Bowl after beating the Jaguars</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-22T06:17:08.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/23/486BB6B500000578-0-image-a-39_1516577847291.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/23/486B945600000578-0-image-a-21_1516576819131.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5295107/Crews-grease-light-poles-Philadelphia-game.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Meet the Crisco Cops!
