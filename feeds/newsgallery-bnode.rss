DailyMail.com has approached the FBI, Homeland Security and Columbus police for comment. Moreno, who in previous TikToks has bragged about earning money by begging on the streets and collecting government handouts, is promoting a concept known as squatter's rights. Squatter's rights, also known as adverse possession, allows someone who inhabits a property illegally to continue using or occupying it if the legal owner does not take action against them within a certain period of time. Squatting, while technically a form of trespassing, requires the trespasser to have the intention of making the property they illegally inhabited their permanent residence.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/14/82663855-0-image-a-199_1711031653895.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>Shutter Up for DailyMail.com</media:credit><media:title>TikTokker tells illegal immigrants how to 'invade' American homes</media:title><media:description>Squatters will often take control of abandoned or unattended homes because they are less likely to be monitored, according to asset protection firm Anderson Business Advisors. But a squatter is not immediately granted the right to adverse possession. Squatter's rights must be established over a designated timeframe, varying by state and ranging from a period of seven to over 20 years. Some local authorities require even less time to establish adverse possession. New York City has a more progressive take on the law and and allows a person can claim squatter's rights after residing in a property for just 30 days. Under city law, it is also illegal for a landlord or homeowner to change the locks, turn off the utilities or remove the squatter's belongings from the property.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/14/82663915-0-image-a-205_1711031860433.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>Shutter Up for DailyMail.com</media:credit><media:title>TikTokker tells illegal immigrants how to 'invade' American homes</media:title><media:description>In all states, a property owner must follow a legal eviction process to remove squatters.

Two of the three 'squatters' who were caught red-handed in a Queens, New York woman's home fled in disgrace on Wednesday after being confronted by the media.

He was just two months old when his proud parents allowed Gayle King – then working on The Oprah Winfrey Show – to come and coo over him in the baroque splendor of their $100 million penthouse in Trump Tower. But first, Melania Trump dutifully gushed over her husband's paternal instincts: 'He's amazing, you know. He takes [Barron] in the morning when he wakes up. And he brings him in his room and they're watching TV together and they're reading the papers.'</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/13/82696815-13223377-image-a-141_1711027046197.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>AP</media:credit><media:title>The truth about Barron's relationship with Donald as he turns 18</media:title><media:description>Then it was off to baby Barron's grand nursery, a corner room with sweeping views of Manhattan and stuffed full of huge soft toys, where The Donald borrowed his son – dressed in a flouncy old-fashioned baby boy dress – from the nanny so he could hold him for the cameras. 'See the little delicate hands,' said the business tycoon who would one day be mocked over the small size of his own hands. Then King got down to the tough questions. 'So Donald, you're not opposed to changing diapers, you just haven't had to do it,' she quizzed. 'But you know how to do it?' 'I would be able to do it, yes,' replied the father of five.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/13/82696509-13223377-image-a-142_1711027161195.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>Bloomberg via Getty Images</media:credit><media:title>The truth about Barron's relationship with Donald as he turns 18</media:title><media:description>But before King had time to ask him to prove it, Barron started wailing and a relieved-looking Trump passed him back to his mother. Eighteen years later, Barron is rather bigger – at 6'7, he looms over his 6'3 father – but still very much tied to Mom. He comes of age today, after a high-profile childhood that, if physically pampered, cannot have been emotional plain-sailing with such a polarizing man for a dad. The first boy to grow up in the White House since JFK Jr in 1963, he has lived through scandal after scandal – shielded, as best she could, by a highly protective mother. In January 2018, he was not yet 12 when the media was engulfed by [adult] star Stormy Daniels 's bombshell claims that she had an affair with Donald just four months after Barron was born.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/13/82702297-13223377-image-m-144_1711027219232.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>Contour by Getty Images</media:credit><media:title>The truth about Barron's relationship with Donald as he turns 18</media:title><media:description>During his presidency, Trump's most ardent critics even resorted to criticizing the young boy as a means of attacking his father. Comedian Rosie O'Donnell, who had reason to hate Trump for once calling her a 'pig' and a 'degenerate', shared a video in 2016 making wild and totally unfounded claims that Barron had autism. O'Donnell later publicly apologized to Melania, but the damage was already done. The following year, during Trump's inauguration, SNL writer Katie Rich tweeted: 'Barron will be this country's first homeschool shooter'. In fact, the slurs hurled at Barron got so bad, that another former First Child – from across the aisle – spoke up on his behalf. Chelsea Clinton tweeted: 'Barron Trump deserves the chance every child does-to be a kid.' And Trump Sr deserved the chance to be a dad.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/13/82696515-13223377-image-a-145_1711027355712.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>Getty Images</media:credit><media:title>The truth about Barron's relationship with Donald as he turns 18</media:title><media:description>Although he would boast in 2015 that 'I've always prided myself on being a good father', biographers say he agreed with Melania that if she had a child, he wouldn't be actively involved in their day-to-day upbringing. (Trump wasn't even in the delivery room, although he suggested 'Barron' as a name). Melania had help when Barron was very small, but she later insisted on raising him largely by herself – with considerable assistance from her Slovenian parents. While some – Melania included – claimed to see a strong resemblance between Donald and Barron, nicknamed 'Little Donald', when he was a baby, others now insist that in one crucial respect he's very different. 'I cannot stress enough how kind and polite Barron is… he's just a great kid,' Stephanie Grisham, former White House Press Secretary and Melania's one-time chief-of-staff told DailyMail.com.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/13/82698133-13223377-image-a-146_1711027381076.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>EPA </media:credit><media:title>The truth about Barron's relationship with Donald as he turns 18</media:title><media:description>Grisham added that she saw a 'definite difference' between Barron and his much older half-siblings – who include Ivanka, Donald Jr , Eric and Tiffany. 'Just very, very kind and humble and empathetic and smart,' Grisham said. 'Not that I'm saying his half-siblings aren't smart at all.' That also doesn't mean to say that Barron missed out on the same cosseted upbringing enjoyed by his elder siblings, who have earned something of a reputation for being a chip off the Trump block. Melania has always indulged Barron, admitting that she allowed him to draw on the walls of his playroom for fear of stifling his creativity. 'His imagination is growing and important,' she told Parenting magazine in 2012, adding that – as fitting his grandiose name – young Baron had an entire floor of Trump Tower to himself.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/13/82696255-13223377-image-a-147_1711027398555.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>AP</media:credit><media:title>The truth about Barron's relationship with Donald as he turns 18</media:title><media:description>At night, Melania would slaver his skin with her own-brand caviar moisturizer. And at five, he announced that he wanted to become a businessman like his father, preferring to wear a suit and tie than jeans and a T-shirt. 'He is a very strong-minded… He is independent and opinionated and knows exactly what he wants,' Melania told Parenting mag. In 2016, when Barron was 10, she did another interview, this time with Us Weekly, telling the publication that she was at home 'most of the time' with Barron, 'giving him morals and tradition and teaching him values'. According to Stephanie Grisham, for family-oriented Melania, Barron always 'came first'. 'She did things very much her way,' Grisham added. 'But she also did a great job in keeping him shielded from a lot of the animosity.'</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/13/82696517-13223377-image-a-148_1711027423418.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>WireImage</media:credit><media:title>The truth about Barron's relationship with Donald as he turns 18</media:title><media:description>Barron was educated at a succession of the smartest and most expensive private schools, including Columbia Grammar &amp;amp; Preparatory School on Manhattan's Upper West Side, where his mother would take him to and from school in a chauffeured SUV. She'd also cook his breakfast every morning and prepare his lunch. He was still only 10 when his father became President and, as First Lady, Melania had to contemplate giving up the very private and independent existence she cherished in New York. She famously insisted on staying in the Big Apple for almost the first five months of the presidency – with Trump alone in DC – so Barron could finish his school year.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/13/82696495-13223377-image-a-149_1711027443670.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>AP</media:credit><media:title>The truth about Barron's relationship with Donald as he turns 18</media:title><media:description>Trump said he was sympathetic – claiming that his son found the idea of leaving his friends and his Manhattan comfort zone 'a little scary'. That feeling cannot have been improved when, after anti-Trump protesters started picketing Trump Tower, Melania had the Secret Service take over doing the daily school run. Melania continued to break with White House convention in not sending Barron to the Quaker school, Sidwell Friends, where previous presidential children including the Clintons, Bushes and Obamas had all been educated. Instead, the Trumps plumped for Barron attending the $50,000-a-year St. Andrew's Episcopal School in one of DC's smartest suburbs in Potomac, Maryland. Some Trump critics couldn't resist taking it out on Barron, mocking his hair, clothes and towering height, which one wit compared to two kids inside a trench coat.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/13/82697139-13223377-image-a-150_1711027452576.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>AFP/Getty Images</media:credit><media:title>The truth about Barron's relationship with Donald as he turns 18</media:title><media:description>However, Barron soon found an early distraction from the pressures of First Child life in soccer. In 2017 he joined the Under-12 division of professional team DC United, playing in midfield and impressing players of the main team with his in-depth knowledge of the sport. His other interests include sneakers – he has an impressive collection – and computers. In fact, his father claimed 2022 that Barron was rapidly able to break into his laptop when it locked him out during a conference that year. So much younger than his siblings that he was effectively an only child, Barron gets on best with Tiffany, say insiders. He soon became bilingual, learning to speak his mother's native Slovenian so well that he could phone his grandmother – who died in January – and not have to resort to English during their conversations. Melania's parents, Viktor and the late Amalija Knavs (a former car dealer and textile worker respectively), moved from Slovenia to New York in 2017, before following their daughter to DC and later – after Trump left office – to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/13/82696485-13223377-image-m-152_1711027479125.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>AFP via Getty Images</media:credit><media:title>The truth about Barron's relationship with Donald as he turns 18</media:title><media:description>They were very close to Barron and are said to have been 'instrumental' in his upbringing, an insider told People last year. In March this year, the magazine confirmed what appeared to have long been obvious from his rare public appearances – that Barron shares his mother's personality. 'Barron is shy and reserved, and she has been a good mother to him all of these years,' a source said. As for his relationship with Donald, White House chronicler Michael Wolff controversially claimed in 2019 that Trump resented his son for becoming taller than him, adding: 'His son is effectively not at all a part of his life.' But Stephanie Grisham – who saw the family in an intimate setting – strongly disputes any perception of the father-son relationship as hostile or distant.

The school was founded in 2011 by billionaire William Koch, brother to Republican super-donors Charles and David Koch (who last year deserted Trump to back his nomination rival Nikki Haley ). What's next for Barron? Insiders say he will be going to college but won't speculate on where or other future plans. 'Did you know when you were 17?' asked a source. One confident prediction has been made however: wherever Barron goes next, his mother will want to move with him.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/13/61684721-13223377-Want_more_stories_like_this_from_the_Daily_Mail_Hit_the_follow_b-a-154_1711027514656.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit></media:credit><media:title>The truth about Barron's relationship with Donald as he turns 18</media:title><media:description>Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

But Macron's comments also prompted fierce rebuke from Vladimir Putin, who quickly threatened 'weapons exist in order to use them' in an interview on Russian state TV in reference to the possibility of deploying nukes should Western troops be deployed in Ukraine. Macron chastised Putin for threatening the use of nuclear devices and reminded him France also has an advanced weapons programme in interviews with French media last week.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82487889-0-image-a-30_1711006399434.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>EPA </media:credit><media:title>French president poses for cringe-worthy black and white boxing photos</media:title><media:description>He also declared his nation 'ready' to use nuclear weapons in an uncharacteristically brash retort to Vladimir Putin following the latest bout of nuclear sabre-rattling from the Kremlin chief. 'We must first and foremost feel protected because we are a nuclear power. We are ready; we have a doctrine (for the use of nuclear weapons),' Macron told reporters, saying the Kremlin's willingness to issue nuclear threats was inappropriate. Having nuclear weapons 'imposes on us the responsibility never to escalate,' Macron said, in a dig at the constant reminders issued by top Russian officials and media personalities of their nuclear arsenal.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/81831531-0-image-a-31_1711006407753.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>Anadolu via Getty Images</media:credit><media:title>French president poses for cringe-worthy black and white boxing photos</media:title><media:description>In some of his latest comments about the war, Macron said last week that a Russian victory in Ukraine 'would reduce Europe's credibility to zero' as he again refused to rule out deploying troops. The French leader spoke on French TV about how to further support Ukraine and the interview was aimed at clarifying his policy that the sending of ground forces was not on the agenda now, but Europe must keep 'all options' open in case the war spread. He said that responsibility for prompting such a move would lie with Moscow as France would not lead an offensive into Ukraine. He said: 'It wouldn't be us,' but later added: 'To have peace in Ukraine, we must not be weak.' 'If Russia wins this war, Europe's credibility will be reduced to zero,' Macron told French broadcasters TF1 and France 2 television.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/81831231-13222205-image-a-32_1711006651611.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>Anadolu via Getty Images</media:credit><media:title>French president poses for cringe-worthy black and white boxing photos</media:title><media:description>He also said that the continent's security was 'at stake' in the conflict which he said is 'existential for our Europe and for France'. Macron later added in a video on social media that Moldova, Romania and Poland could be under immediate threat if Ukraine lost the war. Calling the conflict in Ukraine 'existential for our Europe and for France', Macron said anybody advocating 'limits' on aid to Ukraine 'chooses defeat'. He said there had been 'too many limits in our vocabulary' since the Russian invasion in February 2022. 'Two years ago we said we would never send tanks. We did. Two years ago, we said we would never send medium-range missiles. We did,' he said. 'Those who say 'let's not support Ukraine' do not make the choice of peace, they make the choice of defeat,' Macron added.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82400289-13222205-image-a-33_1711006674365.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>EPA </media:credit><media:title>French president poses for cringe-worthy black and white boxing photos</media:title><media:description>His statements come amid a hardening of Paris' stance towards Moscow after Macron abandoned his longstanding efforts to maintain a closer bond with Putin. Britain and France are Europe's only nuclear powers, but even their collective power is a fraction of that employed by Russia, which has the world's largest and most varied collection of nuclear weapons by some margin - even larger than that in Washington's vast stockpiles. Macron openly acknowledges his position has now undergone a major turnaround, citing a 'hardening' in Russia's stance at home and abroad, which has seen the prison death of opposition figure Alexei Navalny that supporters have blamed on the Kremlin, as well as a flurry of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against countries including France.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82701397-13222205-image-a-34_1711006687321.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>RIA NOVOSTI/AFP via Getty Images</media:credit><media:title>French president poses for cringe-worthy black and white boxing photos</media:title><media:description>He has repeated as a mantra that 'Russia cannot win this war' and shocked European allies in February by refusing to rule out the sending of Western ground troops. 'Who would think for a single second that President Putin, who did not respect any of his limits and engagements, would stop there?' he said in an interview with French television on Thursday, insisting there should be 'no limits' in support for Ukraine and describing the war as 'existential' for Ukraine and Europe. Macron met German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has expressed discomfort with France's more bellicose stance, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk for talks in Berlin last Friday. 'If Russia wins the life of the French will change. We will have no more security in Europe,' Macron warned.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82642711-13222205-image-a-35_1711006705120.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>EPA </media:credit><media:title>French president poses for cringe-worthy black and white boxing photos</media:title><media:description>This comes ahead of a meeting by European leaders in Brussels tomorrow, where the representatives of the 27-nation bloc will discuss the war in Ukraine. 'Into the third year of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, we face a pivotal moment. Urgency, intensity and unwavering determination are imperative,' EU Council President Charles Michel wrote in a letter inviting presidents and prime ministers to the two-day summit in Brussels. 'The swift provision of military aid to Ukraine' is top priority,' Michel wrote. The other, to shore up Europe's defenses. 'Now that we are facing the biggest security threat since the Second World War, it is high time we take radical and concrete steps to be defense-ready and put the EU's economy on a `war footing',' he said.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82592337-13222205-image-a-36_1711006722225.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>Cover Video</media:credit><media:title>French president poses for cringe-worthy black and white boxing photos</media:title><media:description>It's unlikely that all 27 leaders would accept the shift to a war economy that might help produce the weapons and ammunition needed. Hungary for one, Russia's closest ally inside the EU, is suing for peace and refuses to arm Ukraine. Still, the realization that Russia under Putin would pose an existential threat should Ukraine fall has galvanized most of Europe. 'If the Russian president thinks he just has to sit out this war and we will weaken in our support, then he has miscalculated,' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Wednesday. 'Russia is not strong, and it cannot speculate on us letting off in our support. We will continue it for as long as necessary.' Support is growing among some leaders for defence bonds to finance military spending through common debt issuance; the same way the EU raised money for its pandemic recovery fund.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/61684721-13222205-Want_more_stories_like_this_from_the_Daily_Mail_Hit_the_follow_b-a-37_1711006733102.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit></media:credit><media:title>French president poses for cringe-worthy black and white boxing photos</media:title><media:description>Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

He said Judge Arther Engoron found Giulietti lacked credibility as a witness due to his 'ongoing personal and professional relationship with Donald Trump,' although Engoron did allow him to testify as an expert witness after legal sparring over the issue. As DailyMail.com reported, Giulietti has been a member of Trump's Mar-a-Lago and Trump National golf clubs in Palm Beach, has posted about a charity event at Trump's Bedminister club, and testified about meeting him on the golf course.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/20/82636195-0-That_came_before_Trump_furnished_a_letter_from_him_signed_days_a-a-39_1710966460662.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>Getty Images</media:credit><media:title>Letitia James disses Trump's claim he can't cover $454M fraud bond</media:title><media:description>That came before Trump furnished a letter from him signed days ago attesting to his efforts to get any of 30 companies to underwrite Trump.

Trump's latest filing sets up another high-pressure face-off with New York AG Letitia James, after his lawyers said insurance firms weren't willing to take chunks of his real estate empire as collateral, and that the fees of obtaining a bond even if he could obtain one would be 'crippling and punitive.'</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/20/82615361-0-That_left_Trump_in_the_position_of_urging_an_appeals_court_to_im-a-41_1710966460664.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>AFP via Getty Images</media:credit><media:title>Letitia James disses Trump's claim he can't cover $454M fraud bond</media:title><media:description>That left Trump in the position of urging an appeals court to impose a stay while he appeals the case. If he doesn't get one, it will test whether James will follow through on her threat to seize assets of his prized real estate empire. That could happen as soon as Monday. After approaching 30 underwriters, Trump couldn't find a single firm willing to post bond, according to an attestation filed with the court by longtime Trump Organization counsel Alan Garten. 'Defendants have devoted a substantial amount of time, money, and effort toward obtaining a bond for the Judgment. Despite the foregoing, Defendants have faced what have proven to be insurmountable difficulties in obtaining an appeal bond for the full $464 million,' he wrote.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/20/82702789-0-_Critical_among_these_challenges_is_not_just_the_inability_and_r-a-28_1710966460452.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>Getty Images</media:credit><media:title>Letitia James disses Trump's claim he can't cover $454M fraud bond</media:title><media:description>'Critical among these challenges is not just the inability and reluctance of the vast majority of sureties to underwrite a bond for this unprecedented sum, but, even more significantly, the unwillingness of every surety bond provider approached by Defendants to accept real estate as collateral. He said the companies offered collateral including undisclosed sums of cash or cash equivalents and ' unencumbered real estate holdings.' Firms he said turned down the deal included insurers giants Allianz, Berkshire Hathaway, CAP Speciality, and Chubb – which underwrote Trump for the $91 bond for the $83 million judgment against him in the E.

There is 'simply no way for Defendants to tap into the substantial equity' in properties to secure a bond, he wrote in a letter signed Sunday. Trump's lawyers' statement about 'crippling' fees came in the context of up front premiums totaling $19 million that could be due again in two years under a long appeal for Trump, whose net worth Forbes estimated at $2.6 billion. James' office didn't respond to a request by DailyMail.com for comment. Trump's lawyers told a New York appellate court Monday that it's impossible for him to post a bond covering the full amount of his $454 million civil fraud judgment while he appeals. The former president's lawyers wrote in a court filing that 'obtaining an appeal bond in the full amount' of the judgment 'is not possible under the circumstances presented.' They revealed they had spoken to 30 underwriters to back the bond, which is due next week. Their efforts included 'countless hours of negotiating with one of the biggest insurance companies in the world'.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/20/82702985-0-With_interest_Trump_owes_456_8_million_In_all_he_and_his_co_defe-a-29_1710966460452.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>AP</media:credit><media:title>Letitia James disses Trump's claim he can't cover $454M fraud bond</media:title><media:description>With interest, Trump owes $456.8 million. In all, he and his co-defendants including his company and top executives owe $467.3 million. To obtain a bond, they would be required to post collateral worth $557 million, Trump's lawyers said. 'Defendants' ongoing diligent efforts have proven that a bond in the judgment's full amount is 'a practical impossibility,'' the filing said. 'These diligent efforts have included approaching about 30 surety companies through 4 separate brokers.' New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, has said that she will seek to seize some of Trump's assets if he's unable to pay the judgment. The development comes days after Trump was able to post a $91.6 million bond in the E. Jean Carroll defamation following a jury award he is also appealing. The filing suggests that Trump's empire of real estate and golf properties leaves him insufficiently liquid to meet the massive judgments against him.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/20/82658437-0-Multiple_bond_companies_decline_to_accept_hard_assets_such_as_re-a-34_1710966460560.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>REUTERS</media:credit><media:title>Letitia James disses Trump's claim he can't cover $454M fraud bond</media:title><media:description>Multiple bond companies decline to 'accept hard assets such as real estate as collateral,' they noted, and will 'will only accept cash or cash equivalents (such as marketable securities).'

Trump testified during the fraud case that he had $400 million in cash. A state appeals court judge ruled last month that Trump must post a bond covering the full amount to pause enforcement of the judgment, which is to begin on March 25. Last week, James' office wrote in a filing that Trump tried to move the addresses of multiple assets from Trump Tower to Florida. Her office complained that Trump's lawyers 'announced for the first time that various entity defendants operating in New York are allegedly now located on a golf club in Florida.' That included DJT Holdings LLC, 401 North Wabash Venture LLC and other entities.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/20/82638355-0-_Defendants_attempted_that_relocation_even_as_they_claim_to_this-a-37_1710966460627.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>EPA </media:credit><media:title>Letitia James disses Trump's claim he can't cover $454M fraud bond</media:title><media:description>'Defendants attempted that relocation even as they claim to this Court that those assets 'cannot be summarily disposed of or secreted out of the jurisdiction,' according to the filing. Judge Engoron ruled in February that Trump, his company and top executives, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr ., schemed for years to deceive banks and insurers by inflating his wealth on financial statements used to secure loans and make deals. Among other penalties, the judge put strict limitations on the ability of Trump's company, the Trump Organization, to do business. Trump is asking a full panel of the state's intermediate appellate court to stay the judgment while he appeals.

In 2020, Bobulinski publicized a May 2017 email detailing a proposed equity split for a Chinese investment - the 10 percent for the 'big guy' note - and first claimed the 'big guy' was Joe. He also told impeachment investigators that 'it is also not a coincidence' that CEFC used the Biden family's 'weakest link' Hunter to funnel in tens of millions of dollars. But Hunter disputed last week that his father is the 'big guy' referenced and slammed Bobulinski for spewing lies about his family. 'It did not involve my dad,' he stated. 'I think that it was pie in the sky. Like 'Joe Biden's out of the office.

Witnesses reported seeing her with a man the night of her murder, and several people recalled seeing her run into the street waving her arms, possibly trying to flag down help. Plympton was arrested on June 8, 2021, as he drove away from the home he shared with his wife and son. He pleaded not guilty to the murder charges at his arraignment that month.

'To be clear, this court has zero doubt whatsoever that Robert Plympton beat Barbara Tucker in her head and face until she died,' Baggio said in court. 'He did.' Plympton was charged with [sexual assault] and [sexual intercourse] abuse in addition to the counts of first- and second-degree murder. Despite evidence that Tucker had been sexually assaulted, Plympton was not convicted on these charges, as prosecutors failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the abuse happened while she was alive.

The 59-year-old software engineer had been woken up a few hours earlier by his older daughter, Yahali. When she hadn't been able to get through to her father, who was asleep, Oriya had frantically called her sister, telling her that she was in danger. Yahali immediately phoned their father and broke the news that her sister was caught up in a terrorist attack.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662589-0-image-a-35_1710935182303.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>MURRAY SANDERS </media:credit><media:title>Father reveals haunting last moments of daughter murdered by Hamas</media:title><media:description>Oriya, 26, was one of 3,500 revellers at the Supernova music festival near Kibbutz Re'im in southern Israel when thousands of Hamas terrorists launched a surprise attack on the country in the early hours of October 7, murdering 1,200 people. The rampage at the festival left 360 innocent people dead. Eran, who is in London for work when we speak, is softly spoken with a kind face. His face lights up when he tells me about Oriya's childhood: their fond memories skiing, camping by the sea every summer and going on safari in Tanzania. 'She was a terrible teenager,' he laughs. 'All the white hairs on my head are because of her. She loved parties.'</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662595-0-image-a-36_1710935202685.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>MURRAY SANDERS </media:credit><media:title>Father reveals haunting last moments of daughter murdered by Hamas</media:title><media:description>The father and daughter enjoyed a close relationship and would regularly meet for Friday night dinners. 'My cooking improved because of her,' he smiles. But look into his eyes and it's clear that he's a broken man. Eran doesn't blame the police or the army for what happened that day. 'No death or revenge will bring Oriya back,' he says. He is, however, more critical of Israel's government.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662587-13218545-image-a-43_1710935355891.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>MURRAY SANDERS </media:credit><media:title>Father reveals haunting last moments of daughter murdered by Hamas</media:title><media:description>Eran is part of a campaign group, Families of October 7, who have been demanding answers on how the attack happened, as well as better assistance for the bereaved.

We don't trust them,' he says. 'I just want a new government that will work for the Israeli people. My dream is to make peace with our Arab neighbours. This government can't do it. We don't want another blitz against Israel.' He cries as he recalls that final conversation with the youngest of his three daughters, who sported long, colourful nails, with dreams of becoming a manicurist. 'I called Oriya on WhatsApp. Her first words to me were: "Daddy, you can't imagine how much I love you. I love you so much. You don't know how sorry I am that I couldn't meet you yesterday for coffee".'</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662593-0-image-a-38_1710935239915.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>MURRAY SANDERS </media:credit><media:title>Father reveals haunting last moments of daughter murdered by Hamas</media:title><media:description>Oriya and her two friends, brother and sister Sharon and Schahar Manzur, were in a car, having managed to escape the gunmen at the festival. They were desperately trying to seek sanctuary at Kibbutz Mefalsim, near the Gaza border. Just 500 yards from the kibbutz gates, their car flipped over after being shot at by terrorists wearing Israeli police uniforms. Schahar was dying in Oriya's arms. Sharon had called her brother in desperation, but he was killed by the terrorists on his way to try to rescue her. 'At first I thought Oriya was on drugs, because who can believe this sort of talk in the morning?' says Eran. 'I was on the phone to her and called the police at the same time, trying to get them help. She said to me: "Daddy, there is nowhere to hide". I said to her: "Do not talk to anyone, save your phone battery and go to hide".'</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662579-0-image-a-39_1710935274876.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>MURRAY SANDERS </media:credit><media:title>Father reveals haunting last moments of daughter murdered by Hamas</media:title><media:description>With gunshots getting louder in the background, Oriya must have known the terrorists were close by. Perhaps it was at that point that she realised what horrific fate would befall her. In grim anticipation, she started messaging her loved ones: her big sisters Lia and Yahali, and her boyfriend Yishai. 'She wrote to her sister: "You're everything to me, goodbye". She said to me: "Do not come here, they will kill you". She was very brave for telling me not to come. She was so calm.' The memory is too much for Eran, who again breaks down in tears. After taking a minute to compose himself, he adds: 'It's a horrifying feeling, to see terrorists coming to you with guns, to not know if you're going to be killed, [sexually assaulted] or to be taken as a hostage. It's terrible to die like this.'</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662563-0-image-a-41_1710935297672.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>MURRAY SANDERS </media:credit><media:title>Father reveals haunting last moments of daughter murdered by Hamas</media:title><media:description>When Hamas unleashed unspeakable horror on Israel, they snatched 240 hostages and took them to the Gaza Strip. About 130 are still being held, but it is thought that perhaps 30 of them are dead. Oriya was last active on her phone at 8.45am. Her family hoped - prayed - that she had been taken hostage, and they would be reunited with her one day. On October 10, Oriya's boyfriend Yishai went to the site of the attack. There were several bodies lying under a eucalyptus tree, many unrecognisable. Yishai identified her by the distinctive flower tattoo on her abdomen. She had been shot in the stomach. Eran has since visited that spot, now full of foliage and no longer as barren as it was back in October. 'If that attack had happened now, five months later, [the people escaping the terrorists] would have had somewhere to hide,' he says.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662581-0-image-a-42_1710935313668.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>MURRAY SANDERS </media:credit><media:title>Father reveals haunting last moments of daughter murdered by Hamas</media:title><media:description>Oriya was buried on October 15 in Caesarea, a northern town on Israel's Mediterranean coast. 'One of my daughters just doesn't function anymore,' says Eran. 'She can't even cook for herself. She doesn't even go to the supermarket. We're all living in trauma. I went to sleep one person on October 6 and woke up a different person on the morning of October 7.' Attempts to broker a ceasefire are ongoing, though peace still seems a long way off. Any deal for a pause in the fighting would see Hamas freeing some Israeli hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. Eran, meanwhile, is remaining optimistic. 'I really hope the hostages will return. It will let us breathe again. Right now, we're living in dark times. We just want a normal like you have in London. We want our hostages back.'</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82679943-0-Want_more_stories_like_this_from_the_Daily_Mail_Visit_our_profil-a-19_1710935066626.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit></media:credit><media:title>Father reveals haunting last moments of daughter murdered by Hamas</media:title><media:description>                      Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The president's campaign has $155 million cash on hand, the most of any Democratic candidate at this point in a cycle his campaign said. He received his strongest grassroots fundraising month to date in February when the campaign raised $53 million. Biden's available cash is believed to have far surpassed former President Trump's campaign war chest as the ex-president also faces mounting legal costs.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/19/18/82646105-0-Trump_who_clinched_enough_delegates_last_week_to_be_the_GOP_pres-a-30_1710872808945.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>AFP via Getty Images</media:credit><media:title>Biden gets a $1B 2024 boost from pressure groups</media:title><media:description>Trump, who clinched enough delegates last week to be the GOP presidential nominee, only formed a joint fundraising account with the Republican National Committee recently.

Maysmith praised Biden saying he has done 'more to fight the climate crisis than any other president' in history, a nod to the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022 by Democrats which included more than $360 billion for climate action.</media:description></media:content><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/19/18/82645837-0-Other_groups_that_have_been_pledging_massive_sums_of_money_to_he-a-35_1710872809036.jpg" type="image/jpeg" hasSyndicationRights="true" medium="image"><media:credit>Getty Images</media:credit><media:title>Biden gets a $1B 2024 boost from pressure groups</media:title><media:description>Other groups that have been pledging massive sums of money to help get Biden reelected include labor unions, groups that focus on engaging specific voters and super PACs.
