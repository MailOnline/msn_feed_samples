But the Galactico era has seemingly passed, with Real's transfer policy of the last few seasons less eye-catching and more focused on promising young talents. And the results have been pretty mixed. Even in a team that has won a hat-trick of European Cups, many have struggled to make an impression.

If this is not now acceptable, then so be it, but don't go blaming me for disappointing Christian as we have made it absolutely clear that he is welcome here. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I understand that the only reason he won't be here is because of Dale and that's a shame as he is unable to play at any other clubs this season apart from FGR or us. As regards the breach of contract claims, well that will be for the courts to determine, if it gets that far, as we intend to adhere to the agreement next week and if he rejects the payment, then as I said, it will be for the courts to determine which party is in breach of contract.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Furthermore, Dale's allegations about me negotiating a deal with Christian before l even spoke to him is total nonsense and vigorously denied. I never met or spoke to Christian before he signed with us.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The truth of the matter is that it's probably sour grapes as he knows he negotiated a poor deal in August 2018 and he foolishly tried to renegotiate the terms last Friday and bring an additional £250,000 forward to August/January this year and next. As l have previously said this was flatly refused and remains the position now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Everything else he has said is totally irrelevant as far as l am concerned and l won't lower myself to respond to his disrespectful and misleading comments.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have to say that I found the t-shirts FGR are selling quite humorous and I'm sure the Supporters Trust will greatly [sic] receive the funds they generate.

The same probably applies to his business if the following link is anything to go by:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/gloucester-news/its-responsibility-leaked-dale-vince-1680779">https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/gloucester-news/its-responsibility-leaked-dale-vince-1680779</a></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He's probably achieved more air time and press coverage over the last few days than ever before. Good luck with that and well done.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It seems that I'm not the only football chairman he has taken an exception to. When the chairman of Carlisle United, Andrew Jenkins, refused to try some vegan food on offer at FGR's New Lawn in January last year, Vince responded by making the following bizarre statement:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'How many years will it be before we all look at families that made their living or fortune in the meat trade - in the same way that we now look at families that did the same in the slave trade. Not long [in my opinion].'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The articles relating to this can be found here and you can make your own minds up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What was that all about?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have also seen the latest articles about the Baronesses and also the planned mass protest, and if these people think this is beneficial to the club then so be it. Unfortunately, people seem to be coming to their own conclusions without knowing the full facts and believing everything they read. I would have thought that the two seasoned and respected politicians would have known better when it comes to the media and perhaps they should have taken the time to contact me to get the facts?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, Baroness Taylor used to be a frequent guest to the Chairman's Suite on match days but hasn't been for a while. Perhaps if she'd have still attended she would have been able raise her questions to me directly?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As the English poet John Lydgate wrote: 'You can please some of the people all of the time, you can please all of the people some of the time, but you can't please all of the people all of the time'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is never truer than when you are working with football clubs as it seems that for a very small minority whatever l do or say is wrong irrespective of all the good things that have happened in the last two years or so.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe they just have a short memory and don't recall those dark days in March 2016 or the highs of May 2017 and May 2018, the concerts and the rugby league matches.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Again, there have been some reported inaccuracies regarding the payments due to Norwich City for the loan signings. There is an agreement in place to pay what is owed from the EFL money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite all of this the staff continue to do a great job and the businesses and results have improved drastically over the last two years. Well done and a big thank you to each and every one of you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over the last couple of days I've received a lot of well wishes from supporters and people within the game and for that I am extremely grateful.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I will always continue to do my best for the club.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fortunately, l get inspiration from some of the quotes of Winston Churchill and hopefully the following will help us all get through these difficult times:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If you're going through hell, keep going.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I believe I have said everything I need to on the FGR matter and I won't be making any more comments.

He has scored seven goals this season but four have come in two games for Belgium against Scotland and Iceland.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Simon Jones for MailOnline</dc:creator><dc:modified>2019-01-09T15:14:01.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>West Ham target Michy Batshuayi set to have loan at Valencia cut short</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-09T15:14:01.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>La liga,West Ham United,Premier League,Chelsea,Transfer News,Crystal Palace</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/13/8312494-0-image-a-116_1547042041829.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1147327</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Getty Images</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6573515/Ayoze-Perez-admits-wrong-Newcastle-battle-avoid-relegation.html" title="Ayoze Perez admits 'something is wrong' at Newcastle as they battle to avoid relegation: 'It's going to be a long January but we must face up to it'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6571125/Sporting-Gijon-2-1-Valencia-Englishman-Nick-Blackman-gets-winner.html" title="Sporting Gijon 2-1 Valencia: English forward Nick Blackman scores the winner for the second tier side in the Spanish Cup"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6568663/Crystal-Palace-set-offload-favour-striker-Alexander-Sorloth-Gent-loan.html" title="Crystal Palace offload out-of-favour striker Alexander Sorloth to Gent on loan - just one year on from £9million move to Selhurst Park"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-6547235/Crystal-Palace-revive-Michy-Batshuayi.html" title="Crystal Palace to revive interest in Michy Batshuayi after a Dominic Solanke loan deal falls through"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6547787/Michy-Batshuayi-jokingly-suggests-hand-Christian-Pulisics-Chelsea-move.html" title="‘#AgentMichy’: Valencia striker Michy Batshuayi jokingly suggests he had a hand in former Borussia Dortmund team-mate Christian Pulisic’s transfer to parent club Chelsea… and fans love it "></link></item><item><title>'It's a happy camp... confidence, belief and almost a sense of calmness': Michael Carrick says Manchester United are on cloud nine after winning start under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6573247/Michael-Carrick-says-happy-camp-Manchester-United-Ole-Gunnar-Solskjaer.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2019 13:37:52 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6573247</guid><description><![CDATA[United's perfect record under their interim manager has seen them win all five games in all competitions by a margin of two goals or more – a big contrast to the previous five games.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p class="mol-para-with-font">For a son going into his father's family business, there can be few harder acts to follow in football than Brian Clough.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Darren Ferguson might beg to differ, but the romance of the Clough name was always going to place Nigel's accomplishments as a manager into sharp relief.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And yet, here we are again, marvelling at the success Clough Jnr is enjoying. October marked 20 years since Burton Albion chairman Ben Robinson gave Nigel his first opportunity in the dugout and though there have not been the trophies his dad lifted he has consistently achieved in his own way.</p><img id="i-5798feff0d3799f1" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8310830-6573081-image-a-71_1547038667765.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Former Nottingham Forest and Derby manager Brian Clough sits alongside a young Nigel " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">To guide Burton, whose average attendance hovers around 3,000 and whose record transfer fee stands at £500,000, into the Carabao Cup semi-finals requires an incredibly high standard of management. An even better milestone was keeping Burton in the Championship in 2016-17, fighting back week after week against clubs with vastly greater budgets and fan-bases.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clearly, the Clough magic has been passed from father to son and where some players or managers shy away from talking about their heritage for fear it overshadows their own careers, Nigel is more than happy to reflect. He does so with warmth and an understanding that his upbringing is of great interest to the public, and that it has shaped who he is.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aside from Burton, he maintained steady stewardship of Derby amid turbulent times, and led Sheffield United to semi-finals in both FA Cup and League Cup while a League One side.</p><img id="i-7f2cac929fe64400" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8310904-6573081-image-a-72_1547038752536.jpg" height="441" width="634" alt="Nigel celebrates after defeating Middlesbrough to reach the Carabao Cup semi-finals" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He masterminded a 0-0 draw against Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United in 2006 when Burton were a Conference team but this meeting with Manchester City presents an even bigger chasm because spending at the top has become that much more inflated. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Two legs facing Pep Guardiola's special side is a daunting prospect and victory once 180 minutes or more are done would represent one of the biggest shocks in the game's history.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nigel lifted this trophy twice as a player under his dad at Nottingham Forest and was a boy in the dressing room in 1978 when the club won it for the first time to spark a period of astonishing success. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, <span class="mol-style-italic">Sportsmail</span> looks at what kind of manager the younger Clough is and where his father's influence can be felt.</p><img id="i-be8264f45bce23cb" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/09/13/019501910000044D-6573081-image-m-74_1547038853782.jpg" height="447" width="634" alt="Brian lifts the First Division trophy with assistant Peter Taylor after winning the title in 1978" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>STYLE OF PLAY </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clough Snr's teams were renowned for attractive football. His Forest side attacked at speed and could pass their way through opponents too. So wedded to the beauty of the game was Clough that he famously, and fatally, told Leeds's title winners to throw their medals in the bin because they were not won fairly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It wasn't about winning, it was about the performance as well. It was standards,' Nigel says of his father in a Telegraph interview. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We played Oldham in the final [in 1990] and won 1-0 but we didn't play very well. We were in the next morning, running. We used to do lengths of the pitch – sides as we used to call them – and it was: "Go and do six sides." Seriously, that's what's happened the morning after the game. No balls to be seen.'</p><img id="i-8094f322afea02bd" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/09/13/0003D35200000C1D-6573081-image-a-88_1547039020752.jpg" height="449" width="634" alt="Nigel sits alongside dad Brian in the dugout during a Nottingham Forest game against QPR" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nigel has needed to be more pragmatic in his brand of football – Burton could not hope to out-skill technically better players – but he still commands a style based on thoughtfulness and creativity. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is athleticism in his side and patterns of play are readily visible. He coaches understanding between his players and resilience too. Even when competing regularly against teams with far bigger resources, Burton were only rarely beaten by big margins.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the United game 13 years ago Ferguson even penned a legal letter to back his counterpart in a subsequent court case. A drainage company was suing for payment despite leaving 40 tonnes of sand on the Pirelli Stadium pitch. A lawyer argued they were due a slice of Burton's £800,000 windfall for the replay because the poor surface had hindered United. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ferguson wrote that it was the way Nigel had prepared his players and nothing to do with the pitch. He said he was so fearful of an upset he brought on Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo with 30 minutes to go. Burton won the case.</p><img id="i-510b7406b4aa5724" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/09/13/0028FB2400000258-6573081-image-a-94_1547039238443.jpg" height="438" width="634" alt="Brian poses alongside ex-Liverpool star Nigel during a charity event in London in March, 2000" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>TRANSFER POLICY </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an interview with <span class="class"><span class="mol-style-italic"><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/sport/football/article-6566371/Burtons-charismatic-chairman-Ben-Robinson-looks-ahead-club-face-Man-City-League-Cup-semis.html">Sportsmail</a></span>, </span>Ben Robinson, Burton's 73-year-old chairman, explained the club's philosophy. Because balance sheets are tight, qualities searched for are not confined to the pitch. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Nigel's philosophy with signing players, like his dad, is that the character is important,' Robinson explains. 'We say, "If you come to Burton you'll get a manager who looks after his players, you'll get a club that cares for people as individuals. And you'll get a great training facility at St George's Park".'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example in 2017 Stephen Warnock, Jake Buxton, and John Brayford all arrived for free with Clough identifying their solid personalities, as well as football abilities, as beneficial to his squad. Even though Burton were subsequently relegated they staged a late season revival, winning three games in a row when the pressure was on, and that illustrated the mental strength within the group.</p><img id="i-8371f7fc65d2db24" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/09/13/00040AD100000C1D-6573081-image-a-97_1547039392795.jpg" height="523" width="634" alt="Brian shakes hands with Leeds chief Manny Cussins as Nigel and his brother Simon look on" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Burton's club record signing is £500,000 for Liam Boyce. To put that money into context, Clough Snr became the first to spend £1million way back in 1979, when taking Trevor Francis to Forest. Still, he made Francis wait for his debut – even sending him to make a round of brews – because no individual was bigger than the collective. That is a strategy Clough Jnr maintains.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Regarding his own transfers, only Forest in January 2017 have made an approach but Clough said no because the hierarchy at the time failed to appeal. 'People marvel at what Nigel has achieved. Maybe one day one of the big clubs will come in and good luck to them,' says Robinson.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>APPROACH TO PLAYERS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last April Colin Barrett relayed a story to <span class="mol-style-italic">Sportsmail</span> about Clough offering him an alcoholic drink before his debut. Barrett, a full back signed from City, declined and some 40 years on he mused that it was his new manager's way of testing him out. It is unlikely Clough JNr has tried the same tactic in his time but there are undeniable traces of that mischievous manner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like his dad, Nigel likes to get to know his players on a human level, to find out what might be going on in their personal lives that could affect the way they play on a Saturday. He speaks honestly, frankly on occasions, but that engenders loyalty.</p><img id="i-c0cf0c20ac7a03d3" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/09/13/1B7C4DDC00000578-6573081-image-a-98_1547039467043.jpg" height="627" width="634" alt="Nigel played under his father for nine years at Nottingham Forest before leaving for Anfield" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is also a story from his first days as a manager that speaks to his thinking on this. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the time Burton were in the Southern League, the seventh tier of the football ladder, and having earned a good living as a player he owned a Mercedes, having received it as part of his signing-on package at City two years earlier. But the then 32-year-old feared it was too flashy given his new environment, so downgraded to a saloon car.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>DEALINGS WITH THE MEDIA</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clough was the first superstar manager. He was grabbing back page headlines for fun before these modern coaching marvels had laced up their first pair of boots. Being namechecked by Muhammad Ali was all part of it. He realised the power of the media for his own profile but also for sending messages to players.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Speak to journalists from that era and they will tell you he would invite them into his office for lengthy chats and, notebooks filled, their editors would be happy for days. </p><img id="i-dc187ffd09ca42d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/13/8311408-6573081-image-a-100_1547039696373.jpg" height="428" width="634" alt="Clough and his Burton side face a huge challenge against Manchester City on Wednesday" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Interactions with managers now are much more regulated but Nigel has carried on that tradition of speaking as you see and giving time graciously.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He might not produce the occasional poetry of his father, or make statements that scream off the page, but he does provide clear and bold opinions, such as admitting the prospect of facing City is 'frightening'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You could never accuse him of saying something for effect. He is measured in his words, but open to all questions, and has the same twinkle in his eye his father possessed when dropping a jewell of a line into the discussion. </p><div>

How he must look at Tottenham and long for Harry Kane when his own team cannot convert comfortable possession into goal threat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hazard through the centre denies Chelsea their best player: Hazard the wide attacker, who can score and create from the spaces he finds on the left.</p><img id="i-6360fb25b768680" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8309886-6573023-image-a-58_1547036568723.jpg" height="405" width="634" alt="Alvaro Morata has cut a frustrated figure for most of the season amid a shortage of goals" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-5613d4692dbf9a4f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8309958-6573023-image-a-59_1547036644037.jpg" height="424" width="634" alt="Eden Hazard has often played the centre forward role and we don't see him at his best" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Willian and Pedro, even when fit and fresh, cannot do what Hazard does in the wide areas.

So does Sarri.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Conte wanted Gonzalo Higuain. So does Sarri. Higuain is still very expensive and now 31. The deal makes little business sense.</p><img id="i-a5dd4a59c6e46c30" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8304444-6573023-image-a-61_1547036685233.jpg" height="403" width="634" alt="Teenage forward Callum Hudson-Odoi lets fly with a shot during the Tottenham defeat" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-6f359ddd53402b4c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8309992-6573023-image-a-62_1547036731725.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="It remains to be seen if Gonzalo Higuain, currently on loan at AC Milan, is the right solution " class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">THE MIDFIELD CONUNDRUM</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">NGolo Kante is a midfielder made for English football.

He wins the ball and moves it quickly; a turnover specialist.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was the secret behind the Leicester miracle, helped Chelsea to the title and France to the World Cup. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He has signed a new five-year contract, thought to be worth £290,000 a week and yet he does not fit smoothly into Sarri's three-man midfield.</p><img id="i-b979906702176c9" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8309998-6573023-image-a-64_1547036797597.jpg" height="440" width="634" alt="N'Golo Kante goes in for a challenge with Tottenham's Danny Rose on Tuesday night" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's hard to believe no-one saw this one coming. Jorginho is so crucial to Sarriball that it was the one summer signing he demanded before taking the job. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In this tactical system, he is the pivotal player, orchestrating the tempo and rhythm on the ball.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kante is not a holding midfielder, he cannot play this position. He is a ball-winning midfielder and needs licence to run. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Conte soon realised he was wasted, sitting in front of the centre-halves when he switched from 4-2-3-1 to 3-4-3, the key moment in 2016-17. </p><img id="i-545de8488d0f7cd2" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8310032-6573023-image-a-66_1547036868899.jpg" height="416" width="634" alt="Jorginho is the true heartbeat of Sarriball but his presence in midfield has displaced Kante" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS sport" data-version="2" id="mol-092e0470-140a-11e9-a21f-8dff9f829f63">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Chelsea fixtures</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Premier League unless stated</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Saturday </strong>Newcastle (H)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>January 19</strong> Arsenal (A)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>January 24</strong> Tottenham (H) <span class="mol-style-italic">Carabao Cup semi-final, second leg</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>January 26/27</strong> Sheffield Wednesday or Luton (H) <span class="mol-style-italic">FA Cup fourth round</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>January 30</strong> Bournemouth (A)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>February 2 </strong>Huddersfield (H)</p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">He can operate perfectly well on the right side of Sarri's midfield trio and sometimes even look good but this role does not maximise his unique talents. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No longer does everyone leave every Chelsea game thinking: Wow, Kante…</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With Hazard through the centre and Kante on the right, they are without their two best players. Jorginho, meanwhile, has become too easy to neutralise and has not been able to justify this decision to compromise Kante.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To get the best from Kante, the manager would have to abandon the system to which he is wed.

He wanted the ball moving more quickly. He demanded one-touch and two-touch football and movement from his team.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chelsea have high-quality players. They soon picked it up. But opponents have reacted to combat the threat. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They sit back, congest key areas, crowd Sarri's team and then try to damage them on the counter-attack.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leicester and Wolves, quick on the break, beat them. Tottenham's penalty at Wembley came from a long ball over the top.</p><img id="i-5dade0d2526d5e6" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8310150-6573023-image-a-68_1547037085547.jpg" height="408" width="634" alt="The speedy and direct Pedro has been a big miss for Sarri following his injury troubles" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Losing Pedro to injury didn't help. Pedro is fast and direct and his powers may be fading but he still offers Sarri something his other strikers don't.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also, Chelsea do not have the speed at full back when others do. Cesar Azpilicueta was ideal for Conte's back three. Marcos Alonso, a terrific wing-back. Neither fit quite so perfectly into Sarri's plans.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the same time, fatigue is setting in, testing Sarri's desire to operate with a small core of first-team players, resisting any major squad rotation, even in the early stages of the Europa League and the Carabao Cup.</p><img id="i-cba46ad78d301198" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8310210-6573023-image-a-79_1547037235605.jpg" height="413" width="634" alt="Marcos Alonso is a world class wing-back yet doesn't dovetail perfectly with Sarri's strategy" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The development stages of a successful foreign coach arriving in the Premier League often follows a similar theme.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They will arrive and demand more running and intensity, then realise all this high-intensity running around in the world's most competitive league and its demanding fixture fixtures is tiring, and then complain about the gruelling schedule and demand more players.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">NO PLAN B</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps most noticeable in the goalless draw against Southampton when Ralph Hasenhuttl came to Stamford Bridge with a plan to bore Chelsea into submission.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sarri's team had 72 per cent of possession and 17 shots but only six on target. The numbers were similar at Spurs in the Carabao Cup. Only Hazard's individuality lifted Chelsea above the ordinary at Watford on Boxing Day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As more teams - especially those unwilling to go toe-to-toe at football - adopted this tactical plan, scoring has become a problem for Chelsea.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sarri said he was satisfied up to the last 20 metres of the pitch against Saints but the last 20 metres is the important bit.</p><img id="i-df412107d6eb8e11" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8310228-6573023-image-a-81_1547037344045.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Chelsea were left frustrated last week by a Southampton team who packed their defence " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chelsea have failed to find the net in three of their last six games and the manager is behaving as if he thinks he does not have the solution inside his squad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Still, he keeps plugging away with his way of playing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Liverpool finished against Manchester City with Virgil van Dijk at centre-forward. When all else fails, go long to the biggest man you have. When you're crowded out, the most obvious alternatives are set-pieces and aerial attack.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Sarri seems so devoted to his system he has shown no hint of a willingness to change.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe a new centre forward would help. Maybe Higuain can provide the technical presence and score enough goals to make a difference. Maybe it would offer Hazard a little more freedom. Maybe it would lift the manager.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sarriball, however, is a collective philosophy. Maybe it will need more than a new centre forward before it is remodelled successfully for the Premier League.</p><img id="i-56c4f9b1334e2d80" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8310298-6573023-image-a-83_1547037403923.jpg" height="567" width="634" alt="Higuain could be the man to revive Sarriball - the two men worked together when at Napoli" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>

Following Bayern's fourth bid of £35million, which is believed to be Chelsea's asking price, Salihamidzic has lauded the winger and confirmed the club have a 'great interest' in recruiting him.   'If I have something to announce, I'll do so,' Salihamidzic said on Wednesday at the club's winter training camp in Qatar, after confirming the signing of Benjamin Pavard for next season. </dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Glen Williams For Mailonline</dc:creator><dc:modified>2019-01-09T12:14:31.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Bayern Munich turn up the heat in pursuit of Chelsea's Hudson-Odoi</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-09T12:14:31.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Bayern Munich,Chelsea,Transfer News</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/10/8306316-0-image-a-17_1547029485536.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>2077113</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Mark Cosgrove/News Images/REX</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6572445/Will-Chelsea-starlet-Callum-Hudson-Odoi-impress-Bayern-Munich.html" title="Bayern Munich are desperate to make Chelsea starlet Callum Hudson-Odoi into the successor to Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery… so will we see another top English talent follow in Jadon Sancho's footsteps and become a hit in Germany?

The 22-year-old currently plays for Bundesliga rivals VfB Stuttgart and was involved in France's 2018 World Cup final victory over Croatia in Russia, a tournament where he also scored a stunning goal in the Round of 16 win over Argentina. 'I can announce that we managed to get the services of Benjamin Pavard from July 1, 2019,' Salihamidzic told reporters during a Bayern training camp in Qatar, without giving any financial details of the transfer.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Karolos Grohmann, Reuters</dc:creator><dc:modified>2019-01-09T10:06:03.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Bayern Munich sign World Cup-winner Benjamin Pavard for next season</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-09T10:06:03.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Bayern Munich,France Football,Transfer News</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/09/8304912-0-image-a-7_1547026773425.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1000161</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>AFP/Getty Images</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6572445/Will-Chelsea-starlet-Callum-Hudson-Odoi-impress-Bayern-Munich.html" title="Bayern Munich are desperate to make Chelsea starlet Callum Hudson-Odoi into the successor to Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery… so will we see another top English talent follow in Jadon Sancho's footsteps and become a hit in Germany?

If the deal goes ahead, Hudson-Odoi would become one of the most expensive players in Bayern's history, joining for just a few million Euros cheaper than the club's £38m record signing Corentino Tolisso in 2017.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Kit Holden for MailOnline</dc:creator><dc:modified>2019-01-09T10:01:33.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Will Chelsea starlet Callum Hudson-Odoi impress for Bayern Munich?</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-09T10:01:33.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Chelsea,Bayern Munich</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/09/8304724-0-image-a-23_1547026210298.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6572141/Hudson-Odoi-not-distracted-Bayern-Munich-links-says-Sarri.html" title="'Maybe he doesn't read anything': Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri insists Callum Hudson-Odoi has not been distracted by Bayern Munich links"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6570597/Tottenham-vs-Chelsea-big-match-analysis-Hudson-Odoi-proves-worth.html" title="Callum Hudson-Odoi proves his worth and VAR can't come fast enough to the Premier League"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6570343/Important-game-Callum-Hudson-Odoi-starts-Chelsea-fans-rejoice.html" title="'Hudson-Odoi is starting, this is not a drill': Chelsea fans rejoice at selection of young winger for Tottenham clash amid £35m bid from Bayern Munich"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6568859/Bayern-Munich-make-fourth-bid-Callum-Hudson-Odoi-match-Chelseas-35million-asking-price.html" title="Bayern Munich make fourth bid for Callum Hudson-Odoi and match Chelsea's £35million asking price"></link></item><item><title>'I've always admired Liverpool's history': Alisson reveals reasons behind choosing Jurgen Klopp's side over Chelsea in summer switch</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6572469/Alisson-reveals-reason-choosing-Jurgen-Klopps-Chelsea.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2019 09:21:59 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6572469</guid><description><![CDATA[Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson has shed light on why he chose to join the Reds rather than Chelsea in the summer.

His entourage is small, his circle of friends in boxing even smaller.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But times have changed. Eubank's outlook has changed. His record against the best, he hopes, will follow suit.</p><div>
<div class="perform-player" data-tracking-id="59ac2da5888591f1d18cb921a8.xsohe0a9vwom1aofo5is4krre$s=1" data-related-player="true"></div>
<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I wouldn't say I've grown up, I've just realised that at this level you need that little bit of extra support (and) preparation,' he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I trained myself for all these years and it worked, I had great fights and great wins but I'm not leaving anything to chance now, I'm at the stage where I need everything to be perfect.' To effect this change, Eubank has had to disregard all he knew before.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The trigger was last year's defeat by George Groves, before which Eubank criticised his rival's reliance on trainer Shane McGuigan.</p><img id="i-c2a94e8901fb8d32" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/00/8292294-0-image-a-47_1546995139023.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="Eubank is hopeful new regime will help him beat James DeGale on February 23" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm not putting this in the hands of anybody but myself,' he said then.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, after he couldn't beat him, Eubank has decided to join Groves and many of his peers. He has employed a full-time trainer - Nate Vasquez - and employed dedicated sparring partners.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A previous partnership with Adam Booth proved unsustainable. Now in preparation for DeGale, he has flown his new coach and American southpaw Denis Douglin to Brighton to live with him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I've always lived alone,' he reveals. 'Now having two guys living with me, it's different. (But) I've got my new house now, there is enough space so it's all right!' He adds: 'With George I was just sparring anybody who would get in the ring with me, I was just doing whatever I needed to do to get fit, I wasn't really focused on him as a fighter... my main sparring partner for that fight was a 6ft 4in cruiserweight who fought absolutely nothing like George Groves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Looking back at it now I'm like, "What were you thinking?' But that was just my ignorance, I guess. Now if I make a mistake I'll own up to it.' It's a startling admission from a fighter renowned for a usually unwavering self-belief. But now is the time for success, not stubbornness.</p><img id="i-e04251a5a17892cb" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/09/00/1A5E9BC700000514-0-image-m-49_1546995280964.jpg" height="532" width="634" alt="The trigger for Eubank's new regime was last year's defeat by George Groves" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">And as Eubank attempts to make 'amends', Douglin will replicate DeGale and Vasquez will provide assistance in the kitchen and some important lessons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pair met at Floyd Mayweather's gym, while Junior was training in Las Vegas last summer. They 'clicked' and since late 2018 Vasquez has swapped Sin City for Sussex.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's hard to find somebody, even if they are well renowned and well regarded in the sport of boxing, that gets you as a fighter,' Eubank claims.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I just feel like the things he was doing and saying... was the right stuff.. It was the stuff I needed to work on, so I'm very confident.' With the addition of Vasquez, Douglin and Welsh sparring partner Kody Davies, Eubank is expecting a 'big difference' in his performances.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But he accepts there is a limit to their powers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm 29-years-old, I've been through it all, I'm not going to change drastically, I'm not going to be some completely different fighter,' he admits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'(Vazquez) is there to focus me on the specifics that I need for specific fighters. My entire career I've kind of had the same training methods, the same training camp for every fight - regardless of if I was fighting a boxer, a puncher, a brawler, a runner.' The coach is already making his mark. Eubank has long detailed his training sessions on social media, giving fans (and opponents) a unique insight into life as a fighter. But under this regime secrecy has its place, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Spars will be private now,' he says. 'There will be a few little clips of me in the gym here and there. Before it was every single day (filmed) and obviously George and his team were watching them every single day and using that to help him prepare. I'm not going to give James DeGale that advantage..' Working under someone else's rules is not coming easily, however.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It has been so many years of me just doing what I wanted to do... that regiment has taken some getting used to, for sure. And I've never lived with anyone before so having someone in the house with me everyday has also been something I've had to get used to. But I'm seeing the benefits.' So what of Chris Snr, who was his fellow TV star all those years ago - and who has been in his corner for big fights with the likes of Groves and Billy Joe Saunders?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Nate will be the main guy in the corner... we haven't actually discussed (his father's role),' Eubank says. 'I don't have a problem with him being in the corner but he won't be the front man.' Now the time has come for Junior to share the burden, too. ENDS</p><div>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Two years may have passed but Ross McCormack is never likely to forget. As the striker looks to restate his worth in a loan spell at Motherwell, he has accused Steve Bruce of 'hanging him out to dry' with the personal and very public castigation that signalled a sharp career decline.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In January 2017, Bruce claimed McCormack had excused himself from training at Aston Villa because the electric gates at his home couldn't open. He went further by stating he would not consider the Scotland international for selection until his attitude improved.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There would be no reconciliation. McCormack insists their relationship had broken down before that extraordinary press conference, but Bruce's words served to alter the wider perception of his professionalism.</p><img id="i-6391120886d4132c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/23/8290510-6571191-image-a-4_1546991897480.jpg" height="824" width="634" alt="Ross McCormack is happy to be back at Motherwell after joining them on loan from Aston Villa" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">That accusation is one he fiercely rejects, pointing to his success as a captain with both Leeds United and Fulham.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was from the latter that McCormack made a £12million move to Villa in the summer of 2016. But the sacking of Roberto di Matteo and the appointment of Bruce marked a seismic shift in his hopes for success in the Midlands.</p><div>

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">McCormack was loaned out to Nottingham Forest before similar spells with Melbourne City and Central Coast Mariners in Australia. It felt like an extraordinary position for a player who had previously been one of the most consistent, and valuable, scorers in the English Championship.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Speaking at Motherwell's training camp in Tenerife, the 32-year-old traces it all back to that clash with Bruce.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I don't think it was a personality thing,' he reflected. 'I think it was personal. A lot of things had been said. It didn't happen instantly. A lot of things I will keep to myself for now.</p><img id="i-62193c1669d3a2f2" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/05/20/8165904-0-image-a-4_1546720739544.jpg" height="494" width="634" alt="Scottish striker McCormack will wear No 44 on his back during the remainder of the season" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Looking back, I actually started his first game in charge so it wasn't as if he has just come in and said, "I don't fancy Ross". I'm not sure if I started again after that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There was something massive that happened before (the comments about the electric gates). That's what disappointed me the most because, no two ways about it, he hung me out to dry with that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The gate problem was real. I never said I wasn't coming in. I just said I'm running a little bit late.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The next thing, the headlines. I think it came because Villa were 2-0 up at home to Preston and conceded two late goals. Being clever, he probably tried to shift the blame on me. Which is fine but, in the process, as I said, something big happened before. Going down that route publicly was probably not helpful.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Certainly, it created a toxic public impression of McCormack's reliability. Mud sticks. Especially in a business as tight-knit as football.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'What I say to people who don't know me and listen to people who say I'm a bad egg or whatever is that I was club captain at Fulham and club captain at Leeds,' countered McCormack.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'That was about four years in a row. Have you ever met a club captain who's a bad egg? Me neither.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And the stats. The stats back it up. Until I went to Aston Villa I was scoring x amount. It just didn't happen there. That's it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I have seen it happen with loads of players. They get frozen out and leave.. It just feels there was a little more needle in mine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Did him going public make it hard for me to recover? Recover is a very good word. I just didn't think that was the right way to go.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">McCormack now looks on at Fulham spending big in the English Premier League.. With another 18 months left on his Villa contract, he admits some regret at quitting West London.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but I was maybe too quick to leave Fulham,' he added. 'I'm not just saying that because they are in the Premier League now and I might have been there and I was club captain. It was maybe just a year too soon.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He went from being a hot property in the English game to assisting goals for Usain Bolt when the Olympic sprint legend had an unsuccessful crack at becoming a professional footballer with Central Coast Mariners last year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The best thing about that was he was a humble guy,' smiled McCormack. 'He would come and have coffee with the lads like he was anyone, really.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I have never seen anything like it. I have been with John Terry or Barry Ferguson in Glasgow and a lot of people recognise them. If this guy walks down the street, the full street chase after him. But he was such a nice guy and gelled well with the boys.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I set him up for his first goal. He used his pace well! He was a good guy. He could have sat on the beach chilling but he had a go.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He is now seeking to make a mark at Motherwell - with whom he had a successful stint between 2006 and 2008 - in a fourth loan spell away from Villa. Currently working to overcome a knee issue, he hopes to be fit and available for the Premiership meeting with Hibernian on January 23.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I've got a lot to prove to myself because confidence has been on the floor in the last couple of years,' McCormack admitted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Coming here is a good chance for me. The kids will get to see me play. If I didn't come back to Scotland now, it would have been harder in the summer.. Before you know it, you are having to see out the rest of your career in Australia and the kids never see me play again. That was a major factor. My focus now is the next five months and Motherwell.'</p><div>

He went further by stating he would not consider the Scotland international for selection until his attitude improved.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Mark Wilson For The Scottish Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2019-01-08T23:59:01.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>McCormack: Bruce hung me out to dry...

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Defoe admitted silverware was high in his thoughts for the remainder of this season and next as he seeks to make a mark north of the border.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I wanted to come here for obvious reasons; I've always known it's a massive football club,' said Defoe, who underwent his first training session in Tenerife on Tuesday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The history of the club... as players those are the sorts of clubs you want to play for and do well at. You want to be part of the history if you can.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It was an easy decision to be honest. If you love your football like me and you get an opportunity like this it's hard to turn it down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I've been in the Premier League for so long and it's always nice to have a different challenge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Sometimes you can - not get comfortable - but you are in your comfort zone there and sometimes it's nice to get away from that and just try and find that fire again, set targets and have a different challenge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Winning trophies was another draw, especially how well the lads have done since Stevie has been in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Being a part of the history and doing something special here, that would be amazing to be involved in.'</p><img id="i-7f999be4c9e75905" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/23/8289946-6571129-image-a-73_1546990630503.jpg" height="418" width="634" alt="The 36-year-old revealed that the rich past and scale of the Ibrox club were key attractions" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-a1e38be49df37eaf" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/23/8289874-6571129-image-a-74_1546990632754.jpg" height="418" width="634" alt="In addition to the chance to work for ex-England team-mate Steven Gerrard was appealing" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Defoe is one of two January signings made by Gerrard, with midfielder Steven Davis having returned to Rangers on a six-month loan from Southampton. A pre-contract deal for Glen Kamara could also be accelerated into a move this month, with Dundee trying to strike a sale agreement after recalling him from a Finland training camp.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Steven Gerrard had a big influence because he's an ex-teammate and someone I've always admired and respected,' Defoe told Rangers TV.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He's a young manager and his enthusiasm is amazing. He wants to do well and, like me, he wants to be part of the history of Rangers and create something special.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But even before Steven I've known the size of this club and the support, they are special football fans.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It might be a little bit strange having him as my manager. I had it a little bit with Eddie Howe because I was on at loan at Bournemouth when I was really young but only for a few months.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'With this, it will probably be a lot different. My time with England with Stevie was good and we now just have to get on with it, do the best we can and try and build something positive for the team.'</p><img id="i-786b9d527b3989ec" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/23/8289954-6571129-image-a-76_1546990685080.jpg" height="414" width="634" alt="Defoe meets a fan before he trains for the first time with his team mates at the winter camp" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-eca153aac3bf2f13" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/23/8290010-6571129-image-a-78_1546990703988.jpg" height="415" width="634" alt="Steven Davis has also returned to Rangers on a six-month loan from Southampton this month" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Defoe could link with Alfredo Morelos in a revamped Rangers attack. While the Colombian's part in incidents in the recent Old Firm game captured headlines, Gerrard insists the striker is often more sinned against than sinner when it comes to physical confrontations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the Rangers manager argues that attention is a mark of how he has become the Premiership's most feared striker.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Everyone singles out Alfredo - he's a target for everyone,' said Gerrard. 'In the first half of the season he scored 20 goals. He's been the best striker in the league by a country mile so he should see his treatment as a compliment - I would if I was him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I can assure everyone that we are working with Alfredo and he's certainly doing his best to try and improve his discipline on the pitch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He is very young, he is a target. He gets kicked from pillar to post in the majority of games and teams set out to try and stop him and the only way they can stop him is to be physical with him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But we get on with it, he gets on with it. He handles it in the main very well. Of course he's made a couple of mistakes along the way but doesn't everyone at his age?'</p><div>

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is expected Lovren will miss Saturday's trip to Brighton at least, forcing Klopp to field Fabinho as a makeshift partner for Van Dijk. Klopp tried his Brazilian midfielder in central defence at Molineux in anticipation of any further issues to his backline.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the pain Lovren experienced was down to a significant hamstring injury he could be out for six weeks, to join Gomez and Matip in the treatment room.

Van Dijk's presence is reassuring for the Premier League leaders, who have conceded just 10 goals all campaign, but thrusting Fabinho into a match against a striker as physical as Glenn Murray is far from ideal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ki-Jana Hoever, the 16-year-old centre back who became Liverpool's youngest player in FA Cup history, impressed after replacing Lovren but is seen as too green to put into the midst of a title challenge.</p><div class="item">

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Mac on Andy Murray</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If he is not 100 per cent, it is limited what he can do. I had a hip problem when I was 26 and I didn’t have surgery like he did so maybe his was even more serious. I felt it affected me for the rest of my career and to this day, in a way. If he is having pain, that is obviously terrible. It was always going to be a tricky injury to get back from, because he relies on his movement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Australia, I would imagine he is just trying to get through without being in a lot of pain, so that would be sort of a victory. When you are playing best-of-five-sets, it is quite a bit different to best-of-three and that is a tall order. So, if he is feeling pain and not feeling right, it is hard to imagine he can go too long.</p><img id="i-b8c3ecde4dccb430" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/20/8283434-0-image-a-1_1546980498102.jpg" height="444" width="634" alt="Andy Murray will head into the Australian Open on the back of just two matches in four months" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I had about seven years not playing at the level I thought I could. Andy has missed the better part of a year and a half. I assume it is extremely frustrating for him, but I would be surprised if he would not give it at least another year or two to make sure he exhausts every opportunity. Who wants to walk away not on their own terms? Nobody.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Mac on Kyle Edmund</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He broke through and had his best tournament in Melbourne last year, and I felt like he had an opportunity to break into the top 10. I just think the pressure has been building for him because he has a lot of ranking points to defend now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When that happens, the things that bother you a little bit start to bother you more, and it just gets in your head. Injuries have a way of happening when you least want them to. It would be too bad if his knee injury is serious, because he was making real progress for most of last year.</p><img id="i-a1dfe7c392b77cfd" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/21/8284148-0-image-m-5_1546981899786.jpg" height="398" width="634" alt="Kyle Edmund has been troubled by a knee injury ahead of the first Grand Slam of the year" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s going to be interesting to see how he handles it in Melbourne, especially if he loses early and his ranking drops. He is going to be feeling a lot of pressure. Getting to the semi-finals of a major, that is a lot of his overall points, so that would definitely hurt his ranking quite a bit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Mac on Jo Konta</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She reached a certain level, she was a semi-finalist at Wimbledon in 2017, and the pressure to live up to that is difficult. The player forgets at times that they have to keep getting better just to stay at that same level. I’m not saying she didn’t try to do that, I just think it is difficult to do and then you are more of a target with other players and a better opponent because you are ranked higher.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That adds up and it is difficult to maintain. I don’t know her, but I’m assuming she put a lot of pressure on herself to try to improve her ranking and her best results, and in a way the pressure got to her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She needs to add more to her game. She is very aggressive and is much more comfortable being offensive and controlling points. Against some of the top players you are not able to do that consistently and you need to have a Plan B, a back-up. You need to be able to fall back on some defence. The best players are those who are able to do that successfully. There are too many players who do not learn that.</p><img id="i-662270ae0f1084d5" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/21/8284176-0-image-a-6_1546981965391.jpg" height="951" width="634" alt="Jo Konta was forced to retire from the Sydney International for the second time in two days" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Mac on young Guns</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of these kids is going to break through this year and win a major. Whether it is Karen Khachanov or Stefanos Tsitsipas or Alex Zverev, I don’t know right now, it’s hard to pick. I believe there will be a changing of the guard.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Mac on who’ll win in Melbourne</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Australia is the most unpredictable Grand Slam because you don’t know the health of people. Nadal is a question mark, obviously Murray and Wawrinka, who’ve missed a lot of time, are question marks. Some of it depends on the draw.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Novak Djokovic has had great success in Australia and has won it six times, so it is hard at this stage — especially the way he finished last year — not to say that it looks like it’s him. Roger Federer has positioned himself to make a good run, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The women’s side is more unpredictable. It is hard for me not to pick Serena, even though you don’t know what has happened since the US Open. She looks in good shape and it’s too unpredictable with the other players, as there are 10 or 15 women who could win it.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Australian Open is exclusively live on <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://gb.eurosportplayer.com/?utm_campaign=player-england-prospect-tennis-australianopen&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=https:/www.express.co.uk/&amp;utm_content=text-prcom-https:/wwwexpresscouk/-id1">Eurosport</a> with coverage from all courts available only on the <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://gb.eurosportplayer.com/?utm_campaign=player-england-prospect-tennis-australianopen&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=https:/www.express.co.uk/&amp;utm_content=text-prcom-https:/wwwexpresscouk/-id1">Eurosport Player</a>. </p><div>

The feisty 59-year-old hopes 2019 is not the year British tennis waves goodbye to Andy Murray, but believes a victory for the Scot at this stage of his career is simply playing without pain. McEnroe says there are questions surrounding Rafael Nadal and Stan Wawrinka — previous Australian Open champions — and hopes Kyle Edmund can cope with dropping down the rankings after his stunning run to the semi-finals last year.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Laura Lambert For The Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2019-01-09T10:00:58.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Victory for Murray is playing without pain, insists McEnroe</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-09T10:00:58.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Andy Murray,Australia Open</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/22/8283434-0-image-a-13_1546985333524.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1024224</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>EPA </mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-6566055/Konta-withdraws-Sydney-International-ahead-Australian-Open.html" title="Johanna Konta withdraws from the Sydney International (for the second time) a week out from Australian Open"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-6569109/Angelique-Kerber-beats-Camila-Giorgi-reach-Sydney-International-quarter-finals.html" title="Angelique Kerber begins Sydney International title defence with straight-sets victory over Camila Giorgi to reach the quarter-finals"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-6568649/Kyle-Edmund-gets-surprise-cake-Australian-Open-British-No-1-celebrates-24th-birthday.html" title="Kyle Edmund gets a birthday surprise at Australian Open when he's handed a cake to help celebrate turning 24 as he practises with Roger Federer"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-6568099/Britains-Taylor-Australian-Open-qualifying-round-loss.html" title="Britain's Gabriella Taylor out of Australian Open qualifying after first-round loss to America's Kristie Ahn"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://gb.eurosportplayer.com/?utm_campaign=player-england-prospect-tennis-australianopen&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=https:/www.express.co.uk/&amp;utm_content=text-prcom-https:/wwwexpresscouk/-id1" title="Eurosport Player | Enter the World of Sports"></link></item><item><title>Danny Cipriani poised for Munster comeback and a new Gloucester deal</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/article-6570309/Danny-Cipriani-poised-Munster-comeback-new-Gloucester-deal.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:28:44 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6570309</guid><description><![CDATA[Danny Cipriani could be thrown straight back into action against Munster in the Heineken Champions Cup after recovering from a chest injury suffered in the defeat by Exeter a month ago.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

competition.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sarri can be encouraged by aspects of the second half, the way they moved the ball and stretched Spurs and yet will have been hugely frustrated not to find the net, which will intensify his determination to land a new striker in the transfer market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What would he give for a centre forward like Kane?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was no sign of Alvaro Morata, scorer of both goals in the win in the FA Cup third round tie on Saturday, and absent with a slight hamstring strain on a day when Sevilla and Valencia explored the idea of signing the Spain striker on loan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eden Hazard was back in the centre forward role he doesn't always enjoy and Callum Hudson-Odoi's dazzling second-half display against Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup was enough to earn him another start on a day when Bayern Munich increased their offer to £35million. </p><img

I spoke to Bob Willis about Headingley 1981 and he felt the same.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Grievous Bodily Harmison, as he was dubbed, was abetted in the carnage by Chris Gayle's flash at a widish delivery that Graham Thorpe clung on to high at third slip.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The paceman rarely erred in accuracy again during a devastating spell of 11.3 overs that attracted more and more catchers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'That field was all Michael's idea because all I wanted was first slip, second slip and short leg,' he recalls.

It was no wonder he became the No 1 ranked bowler in the world. He could be rapid. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Other bowlers may have hit the gloves harder, but because of the steep bounce he extracted, he also got good carry so you found yourself standing further back.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thorpe had been on the other end of the chin music on his first Caribbean tour in 1993-94, an experience he reflects upon as a 'shock'. Now the tables had turned.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When Harmy clicked he was awesome,' Thorpe says. 'I am not sure he was bowling at his top speed, and to me that was key, because when he was at 95 per cent pace, with a high level of control and a little bit of shape from the ball, he was unplayable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You don't often get out-swing from very quick, tall bowlers, but he maintained it all series.

Good or bad, Harmy was very much a rhythm bowler.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I captained him at the start when he was bowling 12-ball overs and losing his run-up at Perth.

That was the most fearsome spell in Test cricket I ever faced.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I started the fourth day trying to get the swelling out of my hand because I wouldn't have been able to catch anything. But I had a good seat watching the procession of West Indies batsmen going out and coming back. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There was utter disbelief and euphoria in the dressing room because you just never see that sort of s*** happen.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The general view remains that the psychological blow for the 3-0 series triumph was delivered at Sabina Park, where England fielded what became their fabled five-man Ashes attack of 2005 for the first time.</p><img id="i-10af2ab544d21848" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/08/19/00CA16B41000044C-0-image-a-21_1546974774911.jpg" height="479" width="634" alt="Harmison and England's pacemen inspired a first Test series victory in Caribbean since 1968" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-f7bbd95c725565ce" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/08/19/00CA1A871000044C-0-image-a-23_1546974783149.jpg" height="432" width="634" alt="Harmison and team-mate Andrew Flintoff celebrate the series victory in Barbados" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Butcher insists: 'I thought what happened in the next Test at Trinidad was more significant. Harmy knocked over Brian Lara in the first innings, and bowled quicker and better there than in Jamaica. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He was sending down 90mph outswingers that were flying past people's throats off a length. It was terrifying.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, Harmison took six for 61 and, according to fellow fast bowler Simon Jones, was in the peak fitness of his career.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'West Indies had a steady line-up, a couple of geniuses in Lara and Shivnarine Chanderpaul, but they had no answer to him,' reflects Jones. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'For a long time we'd seen the potential in Harmy. He'd made his debut in 2002, so he had taken a while to find his feet. But from ball one out there, he showed what he could do.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The worst thing for me was going into the slips. I was right on the edge and there was no way I was going any nearer than that. I was happy chilling on the end.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'As a fast-bowling unit we were all just starting to hit our straps, each of us took a five-for, and it was almost as if we'd all come together at the right time.'</p><img id="i-9080793810d64f3c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/08/19/00C014D61000044C-6570247-image-a-26_1546975344115.jpg" height="522" width="634" alt="Harmison knocked over Brian Lara in the second Test in Trinidad and took six for 61" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-7f1e6742fae8e2dc" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/08/19/00C9B83F1000044C-6570247-image-a-27_1546975387973.jpg" height="455" width="634" alt="Matthew Hoggard joined the part with a hat-trick in the third Test in Barbados" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jones's five came in the second innings of that second Test. Then it was over to Andrew Flintoff and Matthew Hoggard in Barbados, either side of Thorpe hitting an unbeaten hundred to eke out a two-run lead on first innings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thorpe adds: 'With an awesome bowling attack like that, you knew a score of 250 could keep you in the game.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So for the final 25 Tests of my career I found myself playing a bit differently. Previously we might have thought, "Unless we get 450 we've got no chance", but they helped even things up.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hoggard's hat-trick left a victory target of 93 on the way to an unassailable 3-0 lead.

The former Barcelona midfielder was heavily criticised on Instagram on Sunday night almost instantly after sharing the photo, with many of his followers urging him to take down the picture, and others calling for him to issue a public apology. Iniesta had been celebrating Feliz dias de Reyes - a festive Christian tradition in Spain and many Latin American countries which commemorates the arrival of the three kings Balthazar, Melchior and Gaspar at the birth of Jesus - with his friends and family.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Max Winters and Jordan Seward For Mailonline</dc:creator><dc:modified>2019-01-08T17:39:22.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Andres Iniesta apologises for his controversial picture on Instagram</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-08T17:39:22.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/17/8191134-0-image-a-13_1546968408370.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1452615</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Andres Iniesta/Instagram</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6569473/The-curious-case-Alvaro-Morata-gone-wrong-Chelsea.html" title="The curious case of Alvaro Morata... where has it all gone wrong at Chelsea, would Sevilla be a good move for him - and can they even afford to sign him?"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6569809/Jermain-Defoe-trains-Rangers-session-joining-Scots.html" title="Jermain Defoe trains in Spain with Rangers in first session since joining Steven Gerrard's side... and stops for a chat with one lucky supporter"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6569603/Man-City-stars-hand-ear-tweaking-punishments-fun-training.html" title="Manchester City stars hand out ear-tweaking punishments in light-hearted training session as they prepare for Carabao Cup semi against Burton"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6569665/Newcastles-Sean-Longstaff-aiming-dazzle-Rafa-Benitez-signing-four-year-deal.html" title="'He is one of the top managers in the world': Newcastle midfielder Sean Longstaff aiming to dazzle Rafa Benitez after signing four-year deal"></link></item><item><title>Neymar 'feels very happy' at PSG, says boss Thomas Tuchel as he plays down talk of Brazilian returning to Barcelona </title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6569925/Neymar-feels-happy-PSG-says-boss-Thomas-Tuchel.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2019 17:23:33 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6569925</guid><description><![CDATA[Neymar 'feels very happy' at Paris Saint-Germain, according to boss Thomas Tuchel after reports surfaced linking him with a move back to Barcelona.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Stoke are in talks with Luton over a potential deal for Nathan Jones as the Championship club attempted to swiftly replace Gary Rowett.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jones was placed on a shortlist alongside Chris Wilder but the Stoke board pressed ahead with recruiting the 45-year-old Welshman. It is believed compensation could be agreed in the next 48 hours.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Stoke board of chairman Peter Coates, his vice-chairman son John, and chief executive Tony Scholes have been impressed with the way Jones steered Luton to promotion from League Two with an attractive brand and how his side are now second in League One.</p><img id="i-cbeeb6f5764bfc83" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/17/8276928-0-image-a-15_1546967246198.jpg" height="425" width="634" alt="Luton's Nathan Jones is the early front runner to become Stoke City manager" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Technical director Mark Cartwright, a former goalkeeper, also played with Jones at Brighton in the 2000-01 season. Jones did his coaching apprenticeship at the south coast club, and was caretaker manager for two games, before assisting Chris Hughton.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jones joined Luton in January 2016, guiding the team away from relegation, then won promotion to the third tier last season. His side are in the hunt to go up again and have scored the most goals in League One. An issue for Stoke fans this season has been a lack of goals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stoke also rate Wilder highly for his high-energy style and work on a small budget. But the 51-year-old was a more difficult target to prise away from Sheffield United, who are in contention for promotion to the Premier League.   </p><div>

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">David Moyes is also a contender but there are doubts over whether he would accept a role in the Championship. Moyes knows Stoke chief executive Tony Scholes from working together at Preston but rejected the job last season. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lee Johnson impressed Stoke hierarchy with the way his Bristol City side won 2-0 at the bet365 Stadium and could also come under consideration. Slavisa Jokanovic was invited for interview but the former Fulham manager  turned down an approach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jokanovic, who has been on a break in Serbia, is eager to take up another role and is under no contraints from the terms he agreed on leaving the Craven Cottage club.</p><img id="i-1086e0fe7b79d193" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/17/8278218-6569887-image-a-34_1546969787488.jpg" height="460" width="634" alt="City may try to convince Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder to leave his boyhood club" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 50-year-old won promotion from the Championship with Watford in 2015 and last season with Fulham, playing attractive football.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those factors appealed to Stoke but Jokanovic did not feel they were the right club for him to resume his career at this time. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wilder and Jones also have connections to the Stoke hierarchy through technical director Mark Cartwright. Wilder was with Cartwright at Halifax and played alongside Jones at Brighton. Irrespective of that both managers have excellent credentials as positive British managers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wilder, 51, impressed at Oxford and Northampton before taking his hometown club back into the second tier. He encourages a high-energy approach and has United in contention for the Premier League again despite having to balance the books. Jones, 45, instills an attacking style at Luton that has brought one promotion and could lead to another.</p><img id="i-480c7f15b6f66eae" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/17/8277452-6569887-image-a-30_1546968350190.jpg" height="381" width="634" alt="Gary Rowett was sacked as Stoke City manager on Tuesday morning " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It remains to be seen whether Stoke can lure either from their current positions but it is believed work has begun to explore those possibilities. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The board sacked Rowett on Tuesday, only eight months after recruiting him from Derby at a cost of £2million. Scholes and Johns Coates informed Rowett at the training ground, acting amid fan unrest and with promotion slipping from sight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stoke believe the squad is one of the best in the Championship but the side are eight points of the play-offs and lost 2-0 at home to Bristol City before drawing 1-1 at Shrewsbury in the FA Cup.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rowett has paid the price for being unable to reinvigorate results for a team that was relegated to a backdrop of disputes.

Sky Sports football expert Terry Gibson said at the time: 'I think this may prove to be a mistake on Madrid's part. Morata is a dynamic striker who works the channels. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He's got a great first touch. And he'll control the ball where it is knocked up to him and he's good at attacking crosses.' Those sentiments were echoed by everyone who had followed his career in Spain. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The prediction that Real Madrid would regret the sale have also been proved right because Morata's goals (largely from the bench) have been missed and this season he would have played a big part in filling the Cristiano Ronaldo void. But it just hasn't worked for him at Chelsea.</p><img id="i-b58ffef18887df3a" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/08/15/0501E7AE000003E8-6569473-image-a-27_1546962487905.jpg" height="435" width="634" alt="Real have missed Morata's goals, and he would have played more without Cristiano Ronaldo" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Why?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His attitude has perhaps been the biggest problem. That and the unenviable task of replacing Diego Costa. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hopes that he had developed since his days at Juventus when Gianluigi Buffon took him to one side and told him he needed to project a more combustible image and not be so willing to allow the world to see his softer weaker side, have not been realised. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The social media soft focus shots of him enjoying life away from football have maybe not helped. Some Chelsea fans took to Twitter last season to draw the comparison between Costa and Morata. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was images of the former grabbing defenders by the throat versus pictures of the latter drying his wife's hair.</p><img id="i-48e252f5eb6d0ee2" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/08/15/13FAD14F00000514-6569473-image-a-38_1546962692724.jpg" height="465" width="306" alt="Chelsea fans have compared Diego Costa's style of play to Morata's actions off the field" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-7832f888e6fb0817" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/15/8274028-6569473-image-m-37_1546962689400.jpg" height="465" width="306" alt="The Spaniard regularly posts with his girlfriend Alice Campello" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Does he need a different sort of manager?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His biggest fan was Antonio Conte who requested his signing, but even he became exasperated. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last season when asked when the player would return from a back injury he said he wasn't sure if it would rule him out for one more day or the rest of the season.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Is Sevilla a good move for him?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If he joins he will be going to a side that already boasts probably the second best strike partnership in La Liga behind Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Andre Silva has eight goals and Wissam Ben Yedder has 15. They will be hard to shift but Silva is only 23, and only on loan. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There will be a queue of clubs that want him in the summer and there is no guarantee that Sevilla will be able to make his one season loan permanent. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Morata would be back in Spain where those close to him say he wants to be and if Silva does not stay he would be Sevilla's No 9 for next season.</p><img id="i-881214884031321c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/15/8274172-6569473-image-a-39_1546962901284.jpg" height="378" width="634" alt="Wissam Ben Yedder (centre) and Andre Silva have already formed a deadly duo at Sevilla" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Can Sevilla afford him?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are having their best season for years under Pablo Machin and look certs for at the very least a Champions League place next season.

Perched outside the Derby box for a Wolves corner, 33 yards out, the clearance came his way. His first touch sent the ball up in the air so he instinctively swept his right boot through it and it soared high then dipped into the top corner with great power.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Scott Carson would have had zero chance had he stood by the post and had a stepladder.

The Portuguese midfielder has developed a reputation for scoring from range and this was his eighth strike from outside the box for Wolves. The only time he netted from inside the area was a penalty against Tottenham. Neves has been instrumental in his team’s rise under Nuno Espirito Santo, setting the tempo in midfield and illustrating a vast array of passing, but his performances had dipped over winter as he adjusted to the top-flight.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Laurie Whitwell for MailOnline</dc:creator><dc:modified>2019-01-08T13:46:49.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Sportsmail picks Ruben Neves's greatest Wolves goals</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-08T13:46:49.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Wolverhampton Wanderers</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/13/8269694-0-image-a-26_1546955206653.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6566801/Wolves-2-1-Liverpool-Neves-unleashes-thunderbolt-dump-Reds-Cup.html" title="Wolves 2-1 Liverpool: Ruben Neves' 30-yard wonderstrike dumps Reds out of FA Cup after second defeat in a row for Jurgen Klopp"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6568715/Fans-left-baffled-Xherdan-Shaqiri-appears-vanish-inside-Jurgen-Klopps-coat.html" title="Now you see me, now you don't... fans left baffled as Xherdan Shaqiri seems to vanish inside Jurgen Klopp's coat after FA Cup defeat at Wolves"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6568403/Fans-mock-Jurgen-Klopp-blames-wind-Liverpools-round-FA-Cup-defeat.html" title="‘How come Wolves controlled the ball and won then?’: Fans mock Jurgen Klopp after he blames the wind for Liverpool’s FA Cup defeat"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6567121/It-hell-victory-Wolves-captain-Conor-Coady-hails-Liverpool-win.html" title="'It is a hell of a victory': Wolves captain Conor Coady hails FA Cup win against former club Liverpool at Molineux"></link></item><item><title>Manchester City's multi-millionaire stars arrive in their plush cars ahead of training as they prepare to face minnows Burton in Carabao Cup</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6568963/Manchester-City-stars-arrive-plush-cars-ahead-training-prepare-face-Burton.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2019 13:03:57 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6568963</guid><description><![CDATA[Manchester City take on Burton Albion in the Carabao Cup semi-final first-leg on Wednesday night and their stars arrived at a training session on Tuesday in their plush cars.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Europe’s new Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington said more on his first day yesterday than many of his predecessors disclosed in six months.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If this is what he is dishing up on a ceremonial day filled usually with rah-rah cliches, the next 20 months should be compelling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was intriguing enough during the formal announcement when he became the first captain not to resort to blandishments such as ‘it’s an honour’, but admitted to a sense of ‘trepidation’ and feeling ‘daunted’ at the scale of the task.</p><img id="i-35cd52318f1fad34" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/13/8268540-0-image-a-28_1546953409035.jpg" height="437" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-9b53b2affa698945" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/13/8268572-6568953-image-a-43_1546953478834.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="The three-time major winner succeeds Thomas Bjorn, as Europe bid to defend the trophy" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-7963b7afaa6072cc" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/13/8268586-6568953-image-a-44_1546953485284.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="Harrington was announced as captain at a conference at the European Tour's Wentworth HQ" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>

For starters, he will be advocating a tweak to the qualifying system, with three wildcards instead of four.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He followed that with the revelation there will be no place for close friend Paul McGinley on his backroom team. There was a robust defence of Rory McIlroy after his controversial remarks about the European Tour being a ‘stepping stone’ to the PGA Tour, before a dig at Sir Nick Faldo’s captaincy in 2008.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As ever, each point was thoughtfully delivered, with plenty of humour, too. Asked whether there was any chance of him following in the footsteps of Thomas Bjorn and getting a tattoo done where the sun doesn’t shine, he replied: ‘I think it’s time we rear-ended that tradition, don’t you?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let’s start with McGinley. Such an inspirational skipper at Gleneagles in 2014, why wouldn’t you call on his wisdom as a vice-captain? ‘I will be relying on Paul, of course but not in an official capacity,’ said Harrington.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He doesn’t need to be coming back. I feel the job has moved on and it’s incumbent on the captain to bring players in as vice-captains who could be future captains. It’s too important a role now, and no longer a jolly, if it ever was.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You might have thought he would get his feet under the table before tackling the qualification process but, again, he displays impeccable logic. ‘I’m having stats done to see if they back up what I feel anecdotally but I’m leaning to three picks instead of four,’ he said.</p><img id="i-1f02ce194bd8db82" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/13/8268668-6568953-image-a-46_1546953552085.jpg" height="427" width="634" alt="Harrington has served as a vice-captain at the last three Ryder Cups and played six times" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I find it hard to think how you would overlook the ninth player in the qualifying list, when you’ve got four picks, and my experience is that a player who finishes ninth feels more comfortable and has more belief in himself when he’s qualified rather than getting a pick.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What about McIlroy — is it damaging to team morale when he is so disparaging about his home tour? ‘I read what Rory said but look at his actions,’ argued Harrington. ‘That man loves the Ryder Cup, and he gets so much from it that he can’t get anywhere else. He’s not 30 yet and he gets to be the leader in the team room. He gets the glory and the opportunity to be loved on the course.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He will be 100 per cent behind us, don’t worry about that. Yes, he’s moved to America, and his family is there. He wants to win the Masters, and so those words come out. But if you know the man behind the scenes, he’s as European as they come.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harrington appears such a natural fit, it comes as something of a shock to hear he wrestled long and hard before taking on the captaincy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I can see it’s a natural progression after being a player on six occasions and a vice-captain three times, but it’s not something I’ve taken on lightly,’ said the 47-year-old Irishman.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Just because it might seem to be my time doesn’t mean I didn’t think deeply about it. There’s a certain trepidation because I really want to leave the Ryder Cup and the European Tour in a better place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But I know as captain you’re putting it on the line and you’re great if you win or it’s your fault if you lose. It’s exciting but also daunting thinking I’m going to have to find an edge if we’re to beat a very strong American team on home soil.’</p><img id="i-6f8bb160a43fad3d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/13/8268892-0-image-a-48_1546953985035.jpg" height="403" width="634" alt="Harrington said he is 'thrilled' to be captain but admits some 'trepidation' at the responsibility" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Underlining the scale of the task he has taken on in defending the trophy at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin next year, only once in the last 15 years has the away team won — and that needed a miracle at Medinah. To prepare, Harrington will call on the counsel of every captain from the last 20 years. Well, all but one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Eight put their heart and soul into the job, so they will certainly be a help, while one did it half-heartedly, and that didn’t end so good,’ said Harrington.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just in case anyone had doubts as to the identity of the miscreant, Harrington added: ‘It shows that just because you’re a successful player, it doesn’t mean you’ll be a great captain.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It promises to be a revelatory 20 months, doesn’t it?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong></p><div>

Clough, who finished his senior playing career at City when times were very different for the Manchester club, is determined to savour the moment even if the odds are stacked against them.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Laurie Whitwell for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2019-01-09T00:15:28.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Manager Nigel Clough admits City players could 'frighten' Burton</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-09T00:15:28.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>EFL Cup,Manchester City</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/12/8266384-0-image-a-44_1546949003609.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1146016</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>PA</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6568693/Sir-Alex-Ferguson-set-manage-Man-United-repeat-1999-Champions-League-final.html" title="Sir Alex Ferguson set to manage Manchester United legends team against Bayern Munich in repeat of iconic 1999 Champions League final"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6568533/Chelsea-play-Tottenham-Carabao-Cup-semi-final-second-leg-Thursday-January-24.html" title="Chelsea v Tottenham in Carabao Cup second leg moved to a THURSDAY with dates finally confirmed"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6568747/Kane-messing-Luizs-head-key-battles-Carabao-Cup-semi-final.html" title="Kane messing with Luiz's head again, Tottenham targeting Jorginho, and Chelsea finally feeding Morata: The key battles where the Carabao Cup semi-final will be won and lost"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6568489/Stoke-sack-manager-Gary-Rowett-just-eight-months-charge.html" title="Stoke sack manager Gary Rowett after just eight months in charge with David Moyes favourite to replace him and Sam Allardyce in the frame"></link></item><item><title>Kane messing with Luiz's head again, Tottenham targeting Jorginho, and Chelsea finally feeding Morata: The key battles where the Carabao Cup semi-final will be won and lost</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6568747/Kane-messing-Luizs-head-key-battles-Carabao-Cup-semi-final.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2019 11:55:32 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6568747</guid><description><![CDATA[JOE BERNSTEIN: Tottenham thumped Chelsea 3-1 at Wembley less than seven weeks ago, but the stakes for Spurs are arguably even higher now.

</div><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WILL THE 'OLD KANTE' STOP DELE?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Playing the world's finest holding midfield player, N'Golo Kante, further forward to accommodate the more technically-gifted Jorginho at the base of a 4-3-3 has generally worked well for Sarri.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But against better opposition, and Spurs must be included in that list, the risk is that Chelsea's midfield can be over-run without Kante there to spot danger. Spurs put Alli on Jorginho to hassle the Italy international at Wembley and it worked a treat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jorginho completed only 43 passes all afternoon, his lowest tally of the season, and Alli's energy also allowed him to be an attacking threat, scoring the first goal with a header from a set-piece. Jorginho has made more accurate passes than any player in the Premier League this season – 1,896 – but there is a case for putting Kante in that position for this game because of his superior athleticism.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sarri doesn't like change though. 'I want to play a central midfielder who is a very technical player, so for me that's Jorginho,' he said in the wake of November's loss. Spurs will hope he keeps the same system so that Alli can do the same job.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alli has scored a goal per game against Chelsea in recent times while Jorginho was a broken man by the time Son Heung-min sprinted past him for Tottenham's third goal.</p><img id="i-189a3bebfc0a5246" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/11/8265614-6568747-image-a-4_1546947696421.jpg" height="449" width="634" alt="N'Golo Kante's presence in defensive midfield could be required against Tottenham" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>FEED MORATA AND HE WILL SCORE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was former Chelsea great Ruud Gullit who backed the struggling Alvaro Morata earlier this season by pointing out his team-mates weren't playing to his strengths.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The preference of Eden Hazard and Willian to always cut inside meant Morata wasn't getting the service he craved in the penalty area. He was substituted after just 58 minutes of the defeat at Spurs on November 24 and at that stage had managed just six goals all season, a poor return for a £60million centre forward.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The introduction of a quick and direct winger in Callum Hudson-Odoi against Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup on Saturday suggests Gullit may have been right. The 18-year-old Bayern Munich target twice got to the byline and crossed as soon as he could, where Morata finished with aplomb on both occasions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is a strong case for Hudson-Odoi to supply the bullets for Morata again at Wembley but it's a big call for Sarri. If fit, Olivier Giroud, who scored as a sub against Spurs last time, offers an alternative of holding the ball up for Hazard and either Pedro or Willian to run onto. Hazard likes playing with Giroud.</p><img id="i-d0f73f30db429d84" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/11/8265606-6568747-image-a-2_1546947608596.jpg" height="455" width="634" alt="Alvaro Morata (centre) can be effective if Chelsea give him penalty-area service" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>THE ERIKSEN AXIS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's no wonder Spurs fans are nearly as alarmed about Barcelona and Real Madrid interest in Christian Eriksen as they are in losing their manager, Mauricio Pochettino.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The wide open spaces of Wembley are a godsend to someone with the Denmark international's range of passing. With Harry Kane, the in-form Son  and Alli around him, Eriksen has options on the ball, and invariably picks the right one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If Pochettino gives him a free role in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg, the second leg might be academic based on Eriksen's performance against Chelsea earlier in the season.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On that occasion, Eriksen was instrumental in Tottenham's 3-1 victory; his free-kick saw Alli head the opening goal; his pass for Kane led to the second; he set up several other chances as Chelsea's defence wobbled.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If Tottenham can dominate possession, Pochettino will try to devise a system that allows Eriksen to do maximum damage. Full backs Kieran Trippier and Danny Rose will provide width and Kane is becoming adept at finding pockets of space outside of the orthodox centre forward's position.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pochettino will also be delighted Son's departure for the Asian Cup has been delayed until after this game. The South Korean has scored seven goals in his last six games.<strong></strong></p><img id="i-2e9b7d5d1db6a2ed" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/11/8265684-6568747-image-a-6_1546947791620.jpg" height="427" width="634" alt="Christian Eriksen will pull the strings for Tottenham in central midfield if given any space" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>CAN TRIPPIER  HALT HAZARD?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After a World Cup that catapulted him to genuine stardom, Trippier has suffered something of a hangover this season. He has suffered niggly injuries, hasn't scored a goal since August and been defensively more vulnerable than in previous seasons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having said all that, it would be a huge gamble for Pochettino to leave out the 28-year-old in favour of Serge Aurier, particularly as the Tottenham right back has the duty to stop Chelsea's best player, Hazard.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aurier has blistering pace but Hazard's strength is his close control, the ability to manouevre the ball in tight areas, and his strength in shrugging off challenges once he's on the move. In that respect, Trippier is better equipped to stop the Belgian than most.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pochettino will also encourage Trippier to get forward, dragging Hazard back into areas where he can't be dangerous. If Hazard foregoes his defensive duties, Trippier can deliver the type of crosses towards Kane that Sarri won't want to see.</p><img id="i-348f866b4dd45d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/11/8265716-6568747-image-a-7_1546947876736.jpg" height="441" width="634" alt="Spurs will need Kieran Trippier back to his very best to stop the brilliant Eden Hazard" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS sport" data-version="2" id="mol-586352d0-134b-11e9-9a67-3f3c0dcfbc0d">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">PROBABLE TEAMS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Tottenham: </strong><span class="class">(4-2-3-1)</span> Gazzaniga; Trippier, Sanchez, Alderweireld, Rose; Winks, Sissoko; Son, Eriksen, Alli; Kane</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Chelsea</strong>: (4-3-3) Kepa; Azpilicueta, Luiz, Rudiger, Alonso; Kante, Jorginho, Barkley; Pedro, Giroud, Hazard</p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>KANE MESSES WITH  LUIZ</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The strangest sight of the last Tottenham-Chelsea game was the sight of David Luiz deliberately getting out the way of Kane's shot from 20 yards, presumably to avoid a deflection.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unfortunately, his goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga was anticipating it, and as Luiz swerved like a matador pulling away the cape, Kane's shot ended up in the back of the net without fuss. It summed up Luiz's afternoon, the Brazilian having his poorest performance of the season at Wembley.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That's the aura Kane carries with him these days, even against experienced defenders. Kane, the World Cup Golden Boot winner and joint-highest Premier League scorer this season, was described as an 'icon of English football' by Pochettino last week and he's already adapting his game because of the close attention he receives on the pitch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Far from just being a No 9 target man, Kane has dropped back as a No 10 at times this season, allowing the pace of Lucas Moura or Son to hurt defences ahead of him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Besides his own scoring record, Kane has also created six goals this season – more than his toal of assists for last season.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When he drops a little deeper outside the penalty area, he's capable of making a killer pass, which gives Luiz and his defensive partner Antonio Rudiger the dilemma of whether to hold their line or follow the England captain.</p><img id="i-2b26a0aeba70d8d9" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/11/8265898-6568747-image-a-8_1546948008209.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Harry Kane scored against Chelsea recently after Luiz (right) dodged his long-range shot" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>
