Taking to social media during and after the match, which Tottenham won courtesy of a Harry Kane penalty, fans were quick to identify the errors or Alonso - with some going as far to say they pitied Hazard for having to play alongside such company.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Danny Gallagher For Mailonline</dc:creator><dc:modified>2019-01-09T10:02:59.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Chelsea fans spot Eden Hazard's frustrations with Marcos Alonso</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-09T10:02:59.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Eden Hazard,Chelsea</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/09/8305194-0-image-a-10_1547027126082.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6570343/Important-game-Callum-Hudson-Odoi-starts-Chelsea-fans-rejoice.html" title="'Hudson-Odoi is starting, this is not a drill': Chelsea fans rejoice at selection of young winger for Tottenham clash amid £35m bid from Bayern Munich"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6572305/TRANSFER-NEWS-LIVE-Latest-Arsenal-Liverpool-Manchester-United-Chelsea-updates.html" title="TRANSFER NEWS LIVE: Latest Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea updates plus more from across Europe as January window hots up"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6570547/Liverpool-star-Mohamed-Salah-retains-African-Player-Year-award.html" title="Mohamed Salah retains African Player of the Year trophy after stunning 2018 as Liverpool and Egypt striker marks award with awkward dance on stage "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6572285/Levy-slaps-225m-price-tag-Eriksen-amid-Real-Madrid.html" title="Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy 'slaps £225m price tag on Christian Eriksen amid interest from Real Madrid'"></link></item><item><title>Bayern Munich sign France World Cup-winner Benjamin Pavard on five-year deal... but he will stay at Bundesliga rivals Stuttgart until end of the season</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6572521/Bayern-Munich-sign-France-World-Cup-winner-Benjamin-Pavard-five-year-deal-starting-season.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2019 09:40:10 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6572521</guid><description><![CDATA[The 22-year-old plays for Bundesliga rivals Stuttgart and was involved in France's 2018 World Cup final win, a tournament where he also scored a stunning goal in the Round of 16 win over Argentina.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

</div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>KIT HOLDEN: As they prepare to make a £35million swoop for Callum Hudson-Odoi, Bayern Munich will be hoping that the young English winger does not turn out to be the next Renato Sanches. Reports on Tuesday suggested that Bayern had lodged a fourth bid for Hudson-Odoi, matching Chelsea's asking price and paving the way for the 18-year-old to head to Munich, at the latest in the summer. If the deal goes ahead, Hudson-Odoi would become one of the most expensive players in Bayern's history, joining for just a few million Euros cheaper than the club's £38m record signing Corentino Tolisso in 2017.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Kit Holden for MailOnline</dc:creator><dc:modified>2019-01-09T10:01:33.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Will Chelsea starlet Callum Hudson-Odoi impress for Bayern Munich?</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-09T10:01:33.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Chelsea,Bayern Munich</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/09/8304724-0-image-a-23_1547026210298.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6572141/Hudson-Odoi-not-distracted-Bayern-Munich-links-says-Sarri.html" title="'Maybe he doesn't read anything': Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri insists Callum Hudson-Odoi has not been distracted by Bayern Munich links"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6570597/Tottenham-vs-Chelsea-big-match-analysis-Hudson-Odoi-proves-worth.html" title="Callum Hudson-Odoi proves his worth and VAR can't come fast enough to the Premier League"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6570343/Important-game-Callum-Hudson-Odoi-starts-Chelsea-fans-rejoice.html" title="'Hudson-Odoi is starting, this is not a drill': Chelsea fans rejoice at selection of young winger for Tottenham clash amid £35m bid from Bayern Munich"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6568859/Bayern-Munich-make-fourth-bid-Callum-Hudson-Odoi-match-Chelseas-35million-asking-price.html" title="Bayern Munich make fourth bid for Callum Hudson-Odoi and match Chelsea's £35million asking price"></link></item><item><title>'I've always admired Liverpool's history': Alisson reveals reasons behind choosing Jurgen Klopp's side over Chelsea in summer switch</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6572469/Alisson-reveals-reason-choosing-Jurgen-Klopps-Chelsea.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2019 09:21:59 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6572469</guid><description><![CDATA[Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson has shed light on why he chose to join the Reds rather than Chelsea in the summer.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">For the first time since moving out of his family home, Chris Eubank Jnr has company. In life, as in boxing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More than a decade after starring in the show At Home With The Eubanks aged just 13, Junior has a new, Mexican-American supporting cast.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During much of his career, which resumes against James DeGale on February 23, the 29-year-old has lived a solitary existence.</p><img id="i-3d89ff5d9e2cd9a3" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/00/8291974-0-image-m-45_1546994718383.jpg" height="433" width="634" alt="Chris Eubank Jnr met his new coach at Floyd Mayweather's gym in Las Vegas" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He has been guided by Ronnie Davies and his father, Chris Snr. His entourage is small, his circle of friends in boxing even smaller.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But times have changed. Eubank's outlook has changed. His record against the best, he hopes, will follow suit.</p><div>
<div class="perform-player" data-tracking-id="59ac2da5888591f1d18cb921a8.xsohe0a9vwom1aofo5is4krre$s=1" data-related-player="true"></div>
<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I wouldn't say I've grown up, I've just realised that at this level you need that little bit of extra support (and) preparation,' he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I trained myself for all these years and it worked, I had great fights and great wins but I'm not leaving anything to chance now, I'm at the stage where I need everything to be perfect.' To effect this change, Eubank has had to disregard all he knew before.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The trigger was last year's defeat by George Groves, before which Eubank criticised his rival's reliance on trainer Shane McGuigan.</p><img id="i-c2a94e8901fb8d32" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/00/8292294-0-image-a-47_1546995139023.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="Eubank is hopeful new regime will help him beat James DeGale on February 23" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm not putting this in the hands of anybody but myself,' he said then.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, after he couldn't beat him, Eubank has decided to join Groves and many of his peers. He has employed a full-time trainer - Nate Vasquez - and employed dedicated sparring partners.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A previous partnership with Adam Booth proved unsustainable. Now in preparation for DeGale, he has flown his new coach and American southpaw Denis Douglin to Brighton to live with him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I've always lived alone,' he reveals. 'Now having two guys living with me, it's different. (But) I've got my new house now, there is enough space so it's all right!' He adds: 'With George I was just sparring anybody who would get in the ring with me, I was just doing whatever I needed to do to get fit, I wasn't really focused on him as a fighter... my main sparring partner for that fight was a 6ft 4in cruiserweight who fought absolutely nothing like George Groves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Looking back at it now I'm like, "What were you thinking?' But that was just my ignorance, I guess. Now if I make a mistake I'll own up to it.' It's a startling admission from a fighter renowned for a usually unwavering self-belief. But now is the time for success, not stubbornness.</p><img id="i-e04251a5a17892cb" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/09/00/1A5E9BC700000514-0-image-m-49_1546995280964.jpg" height="532" width="634" alt="The trigger for Eubank's new regime was last year's defeat by George Groves" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">And as Eubank attempts to make 'amends', Douglin will replicate DeGale and Vasquez will provide assistance in the kitchen and some important lessons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pair met at Floyd Mayweather's gym, while Junior was training in Las Vegas last summer. They 'clicked' and since late 2018 Vasquez has swapped Sin City for Sussex.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's hard to find somebody, even if they are well renowned and well regarded in the sport of boxing, that gets you as a fighter,' Eubank claims.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I just feel like the things he was doing and saying... was the right stuff.. It was the stuff I needed to work on, so I'm very confident.' With the addition of Vasquez, Douglin and Welsh sparring partner Kody Davies, Eubank is expecting a 'big difference' in his performances.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But he accepts there is a limit to their powers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm 29-years-old, I've been through it all, I'm not going to change drastically, I'm not going to be some completely different fighter,' he admits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'(Vazquez) is there to focus me on the specifics that I need for specific fighters. My entire career I've kind of had the same training methods, the same training camp for every fight - regardless of if I was fighting a boxer, a puncher, a brawler, a runner.' The coach is already making his mark. Eubank has long detailed his training sessions on social media, giving fans (and opponents) a unique insight into life as a fighter. But under this regime secrecy has its place, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Spars will be private now,' he says. 'There will be a few little clips of me in the gym here and there. Before it was every single day (filmed) and obviously George and his team were watching them every single day and using that to help him prepare. I'm not going to give James DeGale that advantage..' Working under someone else's rules is not coming easily, however.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It has been so many years of me just doing what I wanted to do... that regiment has taken some getting used to, for sure. And I've never lived with anyone before so having someone in the house with me everyday has also been something I've had to get used to. But I'm seeing the benefits.' So what of Chris Snr, who was his fellow TV star all those years ago - and who has been in his corner for big fights with the likes of Groves and Billy Joe Saunders?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Nate will be the main guy in the corner... we haven't actually discussed (his father's role),' Eubank says. 'I don't have a problem with him being in the corner but he won't be the front man.' Now the time has come for Junior to share the burden, too. ENDS</p><div>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Two years may have passed but Ross McCormack is never likely to forget. As the striker looks to restate his worth in a loan spell at Motherwell, he has accused Steve Bruce of 'hanging him out to dry' with the personal and very public castigation that signalled a sharp career decline.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In January 2017, Bruce claimed McCormack had excused himself from training at Aston Villa because the electric gates at his home couldn't open. He went further by stating he would not consider the Scotland international for selection until his attitude improved.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There would be no reconciliation. McCormack insists their relationship had broken down before that extraordinary press conference, but Bruce's words served to alter the wider perception of his professionalism.</p><img id="i-6391120886d4132c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/23/8290510-6571191-image-a-4_1546991897480.jpg" height="824" width="634" alt="Ross McCormack is happy to be back at Motherwell after joining them on loan from Aston Villa" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">That accusation is one he fiercely rejects, pointing to his success as a captain with both Leeds United and Fulham.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was from the latter that McCormack made a £12million move to Villa in the summer of 2016. But the sacking of Roberto di Matteo and the appointment of Bruce marked a seismic shift in his hopes for success in the Midlands.</p><div>

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">McCormack was loaned out to Nottingham Forest before similar spells with Melbourne City and Central Coast Mariners in Australia. It felt like an extraordinary position for a player who had previously been one of the most consistent, and valuable, scorers in the English Championship.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Speaking at Motherwell's training camp in Tenerife, the 32-year-old traces it all back to that clash with Bruce.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I don't think it was a personality thing,' he reflected. 'I think it was personal. A lot of things had been said. It didn't happen instantly. A lot of things I will keep to myself for now.</p><img id="i-62193c1669d3a2f2" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/05/20/8165904-0-image-a-4_1546720739544.jpg" height="494" width="634" alt="Scottish striker McCormack will wear No 44 on his back during the remainder of the season" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Looking back, I actually started his first game in charge so it wasn't as if he has just come in and said, "I don't fancy Ross". I'm not sure if I started again after that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There was something massive that happened before (the comments about the electric gates). That's what disappointed me the most because, no two ways about it, he hung me out to dry with that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The gate problem was real. I never said I wasn't coming in. I just said I'm running a little bit late.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The next thing, the headlines. I think it came because Villa were 2-0 up at home to Preston and conceded two late goals. Being clever, he probably tried to shift the blame on me. Which is fine but, in the process, as I said, something big happened before. Going down that route publicly was probably not helpful.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Certainly, it created a toxic public impression of McCormack's reliability. Mud sticks. Especially in a business as tight-knit as football.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'What I say to people who don't know me and listen to people who say I'm a bad egg or whatever is that I was club captain at Fulham and club captain at Leeds,' countered McCormack.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'That was about four years in a row. Have you ever met a club captain who's a bad egg? Me neither.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And the stats. The stats back it up. Until I went to Aston Villa I was scoring x amount.

It just feels there was a little more needle in mine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Did him going public make it hard for me to recover? Recover is a very good word. I just didn't think that was the right way to go.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">McCormack now looks on at Fulham spending big in the English Premier League.. With another 18 months left on his Villa contract, he admits some regret at quitting West London.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but I was maybe too quick to leave Fulham,' he added. 'I'm not just saying that because they are in the Premier League now and I might have been there and I was club captain. It was maybe just a year too soon.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He went from being a hot property in the English game to assisting goals for Usain Bolt when the Olympic sprint legend had an unsuccessful crack at becoming a professional footballer with Central Coast Mariners last year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The best thing about that was he was a humble guy,' smiled McCormack. 'He would come and have coffee with the lads like he was anyone, really.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I have never seen anything like it. I have been with John Terry or Barry Ferguson in Glasgow and a lot of people recognise them. If this guy walks down the street, the full street chase after him. But he was such a nice guy and gelled well with the boys.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I set him up for his first goal. He used his pace well! He was a good guy.

Currently working to overcome a knee issue, he hopes to be fit and available for the Premiership meeting with Hibernian on January 23.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I've got a lot to prove to myself because confidence has been on the floor in the last couple of years,' McCormack admitted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Coming here is a good chance for me. The kids will get to see me play. If I didn't come back to Scotland now, it would have been harder in the summer.. Before you know it, you are having to see out the rest of your career in Australia and the kids never see me play again. That was a major factor. My focus now is the next five months and Motherwell.'</p><div>

As the striker looks to restate his worth in a loan spell at Motherwell, he has accused Steve Bruce of 'hanging him out to dry' with the personal and very public castigation that signalled a sharp career decline. In January 2017, Bruce claimed McCormack had excused himself from training at Aston Villa because the electric gates at his home couldn't open. He went further by stating he would not consider the Scotland international for selection until his attitude improved.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Mark Wilson For The Scottish Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2019-01-08T23:59:01.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>McCormack: Bruce hung me out to dry...

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Defoe admitted silverware was high in his thoughts for the remainder of this season and next as he seeks to make a mark north of the border.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I wanted to come here for obvious reasons; I've always known it's a massive football club,' said Defoe, who underwent his first training session in Tenerife on Tuesday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The history of the club... as players those are the sorts of clubs you want to play for and do well at. You want to be part of the history if you can.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It was an easy decision to be honest. If you love your football like me and you get an opportunity like this it's hard to turn it down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I've been in the Premier League for so long and it's always nice to have a different challenge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Sometimes you can - not get comfortable - but you are in your comfort zone there and sometimes it's nice to get away from that and just try and find that fire again, set targets and have a different challenge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Winning trophies was another draw, especially how well the lads have done since Stevie has been in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Being a part of the history and doing something special here, that would be amazing to be involved in.'</p><img id="i-7f999be4c9e75905" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/23/8289946-6571129-image-a-73_1546990630503.jpg" height="418" width="634" alt="The 36-year-old revealed that the rich past and scale of the Ibrox club were key attractions" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-a1e38be49df37eaf" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/23/8289874-6571129-image-a-74_1546990632754.jpg" height="418" width="634" alt="In addition to the chance to work for ex-England team-mate Steven Gerrard was appealing" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Defoe is one of two January signings made by Gerrard, with midfielder Steven Davis having returned to Rangers on a six-month loan from Southampton. A pre-contract deal for Glen Kamara could also be accelerated into a move this month, with Dundee trying to strike a sale agreement after recalling him from a Finland training camp.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Steven Gerrard had a big influence because he's an ex-teammate and someone I've always admired and respected,' Defoe told Rangers TV.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He's a young manager and his enthusiasm is amazing. He wants to do well and, like me, he wants to be part of the history of Rangers and create something special.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But even before Steven I've known the size of this club and the support, they are special football fans.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It might be a little bit strange having him as my manager. I had it a little bit with Eddie Howe because I was on at loan at Bournemouth when I was really young but only for a few months.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'With this, it will probably be a lot different.

'In the first half of the season he scored 20 goals. He's been the best striker in the league by a country mile so he should see his treatment as a compliment - I would if I was him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I can assure everyone that we are working with Alfredo and he's certainly doing his best to try and improve his discipline on the pitch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He is very young, he is a target. He gets kicked from pillar to post in the majority of games and teams set out to try and stop him and the only way they can stop him is to be physical with him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But we get on with it, he gets on with it. He handles it in the main very well. Of course he's made a couple of mistakes along the way but doesn't everyone at his age?'</p><div>

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is expected Lovren will miss Saturday's trip to Brighton at least, forcing Klopp to field Fabinho as a makeshift partner for Van Dijk. Klopp tried his Brazilian midfielder in central defence at Molineux in anticipation of any further issues to his backline.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the pain Lovren experienced was down to a significant hamstring injury he could be out for six weeks, to join Gomez and Matip in the treatment room. Gomez has been out since suffering a break in his lower left leg during Liverpool's 3-1 win at Burnley on December 5, while Matip required surgery after fracturing his collarbone in the Champions League clash with Napoli at Anfield on December 11.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is believed Matip could be fit for the visit of Crystal Palace on January 19, but Gomez may not return until February depending on how rehabilitation goes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the meantime Klopp is left with a problem at the heart of a defence which has been imperious this season. Van Dijk's presence is reassuring for the Premier League leaders, who have conceded just 10 goals all campaign, but thrusting Fabinho into a match against a striker as physical as Glenn Murray is far from ideal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ki-Jana Hoever, the 16-year-old centre back who became Liverpool's youngest player in FA Cup history, impressed after replacing Lovren but is seen as too green to put into the midst of a title challenge.</p><div class="item">

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Mac on Andy Murray</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If he is not 100 per cent, it is limited what he can do. I had a hip problem when I was 26 and I didn’t have surgery like he did so maybe his was even more serious. I felt it affected me for the rest of my career and to this day, in a way. If he is having pain, that is obviously terrible. It was always going to be a tricky injury to get back from, because he relies on his movement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Australia, I would imagine he is just trying to get through without being in a lot of pain, so that would be sort of a victory. When you are playing best-of-five-sets, it is quite a bit different to best-of-three and that is a tall order. So, if he is feeling pain and not feeling right, it is hard to imagine he can go too long.</p><img id="i-b8c3ecde4dccb430" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/20/8283434-0-image-a-1_1546980498102.jpg" height="444" width="634" alt="Andy Murray will head into the Australian Open on the back of just two matches in four months" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I had about seven years not playing at the level I thought I could. Andy has missed the better part of a year and a half. I assume it is extremely frustrating for him, but I would be surprised if he would not give it at least another year or two to make sure he exhausts every opportunity. Who wants to walk away not on their own terms? Nobody.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Mac on Kyle Edmund</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He broke through and had his best tournament in Melbourne last year, and I felt like he had an opportunity to break into the top 10. I just think the pressure has been building for him because he has a lot of ranking points to defend now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When that happens, the things that bother you a little bit start to bother you more, and it just gets in your head. Injuries have a way of happening when you least want them to. It would be too bad if his knee injury is serious, because he was making real progress for most of last year.</p><img id="i-a1dfe7c392b77cfd" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/21/8284148-0-image-m-5_1546981899786.jpg" height="398" width="634" alt="Kyle Edmund has been troubled by a knee injury ahead of the first Grand Slam of the year" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s going to be interesting to see how he handles it in Melbourne, especially if he loses early and his ranking drops. He is going to be feeling a lot of pressure. Getting to the semi-finals of a major, that is a lot of his overall points, so that would definitely hurt his ranking quite a bit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Mac on Jo Konta</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She reached a certain level, she was a semi-finalist at Wimbledon in 2017, and the pressure to live up to that is difficult. The player forgets at times that they have to keep getting better just to stay at that same level. I’m not saying she didn’t try to do that, I just think it is difficult to do and then you are more of a target with other players and a better opponent because you are ranked higher.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That adds up and it is difficult to maintain. I don’t know her, but I’m assuming she put a lot of pressure on herself to try to improve her ranking and her best results, and in a way the pressure got to her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She needs to add more to her game. She is very aggressive and is much more comfortable being offensive and controlling points. Against some of the top players you are not able to do that consistently and you need to have a Plan B, a back-up. You need to be able to fall back on some defence. The best players are those who are able to do that successfully. There are too many players who do not learn that.</p><img id="i-662270ae0f1084d5" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/21/8284176-0-image-a-6_1546981965391.jpg" height="951" width="634" alt="Jo Konta was forced to retire from the Sydney International for the second time in two days" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Mac on young Guns</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of these kids is going to break through this year and win a major. Whether it is Karen Khachanov or Stefanos Tsitsipas or Alex Zverev, I don’t know right now, it’s hard to pick. I believe there will be a changing of the guard.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Mac on who’ll win in Melbourne</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Australia is the most unpredictable Grand Slam because you don’t know the health of people. Nadal is a question mark, obviously Murray and Wawrinka, who’ve missed a lot of time, are question marks. Some of it depends on the draw.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Novak Djokovic has had great success in Australia and has won it six times, so it is hard at this stage — especially the way he finished last year — not to say that it looks like it’s him.

There were 16,654 at the Stadium of Light for a Checkatrade Trophy fixture that will enter the hosts’ history books but will be readily discarded as an Under-21 outing by the visitors.

It is an image synonymous with cricket in the Caribbean. Only in this picture the hunters in question are not West Indians but Englishmen, members of the only England team able to reflect on a Test series victory in that part of the world since 1968. The once-in-a-generation bowler orchestrating the once-in-a-half-century success was Steve Harmison who, with astonishing figures of seven for 12 at Sabina Park on March 14, 2004, became the opponent batsmen around the world most feared to face. For those who trade in pace, there is no greater compliment.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>Daily Mail</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Richard Gibson for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2019-01-08T20:48:46.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>The day Steve Harmison took 7-12... and England had eight slips!</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-08T20:48:46.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>England Cricket</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/20/8281848-0-image-a-3_1546977607296.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-6563187/As-England-prepare-crazy-year-Nasser-Hussain-warns-Dont-burn-out.html" title="As England prepare for a crazy year which includes the World Cup and the Ashes, Nasser Hussain warns...

It is believed compensation could be agreed in the next 48 hours.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Stoke board of chairman Peter Coates, his vice-chairman son John, and chief executive Tony Scholes have been impressed with the way Jones steered Luton to promotion from League Two with an attractive brand and how his side are now second in League One.</p><img id="i-cbeeb6f5764bfc83" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/17/8276928-0-image-a-15_1546967246198.jpg" height="425" width="634" alt="Luton's Nathan Jones is the early front runner to become Stoke City manager" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Technical director Mark Cartwright, a former goalkeeper, also played with Jones at Brighton in the 2000-01 season. Jones did his coaching apprenticeship at the south coast club, and was caretaker manager for two games, before assisting Chris Hughton.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jones joined Luton in January 2016, guiding the team away from relegation, then won promotion to the third tier last season. His side are in the hunt to go up again and have scored the most goals in League One. An issue for Stoke fans this season has been a lack of goals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stoke also rate Wilder highly for his high-energy style and work on a small budget. But the 51-year-old was a more difficult target to prise away from Sheffield United, who are in contention for promotion to the Premier League.   </p><div>

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">David Moyes is also a contender but there are doubts over whether he would accept a role in the Championship. Moyes knows Stoke chief executive Tony Scholes from working together at Preston but rejected the job last season. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lee Johnson impressed Stoke hierarchy with the way his Bristol City side won 2-0 at the bet365 Stadium and could also come under consideration. Slavisa Jokanovic was invited for interview but the former Fulham manager  turned down an approach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jokanovic, who has been on a break in Serbia, is eager to take up another role and is under no contraints from the terms he agreed on leaving the Craven Cottage club.</p><img id="i-1086e0fe7b79d193" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/17/8278218-6569887-image-a-34_1546969787488.jpg" height="460" width="634" alt="City may try to convince Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder to leave his boyhood club" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 50-year-old won promotion from the Championship with Watford in 2015 and last season with Fulham, playing attractive football.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those factors appealed to Stoke but Jokanovic did not feel they were the right club for him to resume his career at this time. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wilder and Jones also have connections to the Stoke hierarchy through technical director Mark Cartwright. Wilder was with Cartwright at Halifax and played alongside Jones at Brighton. Irrespective of that both managers have excellent credentials as positive British managers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wilder, 51, impressed at Oxford and Northampton before taking his hometown club back into the second tier. He encourages a high-energy approach and has United in contention for the Premier League again despite having to balance the books. Jones, 45, instills an attacking style at Luton that has brought one promotion and could lead to another.</p><img id="i-480c7f15b6f66eae" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/17/8277452-6569887-image-a-30_1546968350190.jpg" height="381" width="634" alt="Gary Rowett was sacked as Stoke City manager on Tuesday morning " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It remains to be seen whether Stoke can lure either from their current positions but it is believed work has begun to explore those possibilities. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The board sacked Rowett on Tuesday, only eight months after recruiting him from Derby at a cost of £2million. Scholes and Johns Coates informed Rowett at the training ground, acting amid fan unrest and with promotion slipping from sight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stoke believe the squad is one of the best in the Championship but the side are eight points of the play-offs and lost 2-0 at home to Bristol City before drawing 1-1 at Shrewsbury in the FA Cup.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rowett has paid the price for being unable to reinvigorate results for a team that was relegated to a backdrop of disputes. There has been scrutiny on Cartwright for a number of failed signings.</p><img id="i-6452af003bd5cdcd" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/17/8277626-6569887-Peter_Crouch_equalises_for_Stoke_at_Shrewsbury_but_it_isn_t_enou-a-33_1546969342194.jpg" height="396" width="634" alt="Peter Crouch equalises for Stoke at Shrewsbury, but it isn't enough to save manager Rowett" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rowett experienced frustrations in shaping his team, with eight players expressing a desire to leave in the summer, and some transfer targets were met with resistance. The balance of the squad after signings made by Mark Hughes and Paul Lambert was a significant issue.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Stoke did make a net spend of some £35million and were able to keep hold of Joe Allen and Jack Butland, so returning to the Premier League at the first time of asking was seen as essential.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although Rowett had kept the players onside, supporters had turned and Stoke's hierarchy felt a change was necessary to try to revive a promotion bid.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A club statement read: 'A new managerial appointment will be made as swiftly as possible but in the meantime Rory Delap, Kevin Russell and Andy Quy will take charge of first-team affairs.'</p><div>

Wilder has admirers at Stoke for taking Sheffield United into the Championship and guiding the club into promotion contention for the second successive season on a small budget. Jones is another in contention after leading Luton up from League Two with an attractive brand of football. The Kenilworth Road club are currently second in League One.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Laurie Whitwell for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2019-01-09T00:40:58.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Luton Town boss Nathan Jones lined up by Stoke City</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-09T00:40:58.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Stoke City,Sheffield United</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/17/8276928-0-image-a-25_1546967873836.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1147327</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Getty Images</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6568489/Stoke-sack-manager-Gary-Rowett-just-eight-months-charge.html" title="Stoke sack manager Gary Rowett after just eight months in charge with David Moyes favourite to replace him and Sam Allardyce in the frame"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6560405/Shrewsbury-1-1-Stoke-Crouch-comes-Potters-rescue-coming-bench-force-replay.html" title="Shrewsbury 1-1 Stoke: Peter Crouch comes to Potters' rescue after coming off the bench to score four minutes later to force a replay with the Shrews "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6560493/Sheffield-Wednesday-0-0-Luton-Hatters-earn-FA-Cup-round-replay.html" title="Sheffield Wednesday 0-0 Luton: Hatters earn FA Cup third-round replay following Hillsborough stalemate"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6563151/Chris-Wilder-slams-Sheffield-United-knocked-FA-Cup-Barnet.html" title="'The fans should have booed the players louder': Chris Wilder slams his Sheffield United side after they are knocked out of FA Cup by Barnet"></link></item><item><title>Jermain Defoe trains in Spain with Rangers in first session since joining Steven Gerrard's side... and stops for a chat with one lucky supporter</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6569809/Jermain-Defoe-trains-Rangers-session-joining-Scots.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2019 17:16:01 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6569809</guid><description><![CDATA[Defoe may have found first team chances scarce on the south coast this season, but he looked sharp as he got straight into the action, striking and passing the ball with purpose.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[
