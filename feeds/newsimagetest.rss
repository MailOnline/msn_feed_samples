and suffering a bloodbath on councils. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The PM is pinning his hopes on crucial <strong>mayoral contests</strong> as results continue to flow in, with experts warning the <a href="https://www.dailymailint.co.uk/news/conservatives/index.html">Conservatives</a> are on track for their worst showing in 40 years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a href="https://www.dailymailint.co.uk/news/labour/index.html">Labour</a>'s Chris Webb secured a massive 26 per cent swing in Blackpool South to become the newest MP in the Commons -

Jim Chilton (pictured), 72, hurled the accusation in a filmed interview Monday, days after the collapse of a long-awaited bipartisan security deal aimed at regaining control of the Southern Border. The deal, which had been in talks for months, collapsed days after it was revealed that all but four Republicans had voted against it, avoiding an overhaul of the US' asylum system.</figcaption><span class="copyright">AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/13/10/81198057-0-image-a-62_1707819570671.jpg" /><figcaption>Critics such as Donald Trump had said the legislation was not aggressive enough to curb illegal immigration, and Democrats in turn accused conservatives of killing it for political purposes. In comments to Fox News, Chilton - whose 50,000-acre family farm has surfaced as a popular crossing point for migrants - chided lawmakers for letting the bill fall through at the expense of everyday Americans. 'It's people talking about the issues, arguing about the issues,' he said of the current political landscape that he says if fueling the crisis. 'Border security has always been a political football,' he sniped, using the euphemism that refers to politicians' using an issue for a political advantage. 'That's the nature of our system.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">AP</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/13/10/78530103-0-image-a-63_1707819583850.jpg" /><figcaption>Moreover, with the crisis at the border being one of Joe Biden's biggest obstacles, the hesitance from GOP House Republicans to embrace the bill could very well hinder the current commander-in-chief's biggest chance at reelection. That's, for the most part, the stance of House Democrats - after 217 of their Republican counterparts blocked the deal that would have increased regulations and limited crossings, despite repeatedly calling for Biden to close the border.</figcaption><span class="copyright">None</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/13/10/81186437-0-image-a-64_1707819594654.jpg" /><figcaption>Chilton told Fox News keeping Americans safe should be lawmakers' top priority - not positioning themselves for a potential Trump win that's still, if it's even successful, nearly a year away 'It would be outrageous not to secure our border first,' Chilton said of congressmen's failure to finish the deal. 'Take care of America first. Seal the border.' He went on to provide proof of the worsening - and constantly-evolving - migrant crisis, citing hidden camera footage on his property that have caught thousands of people illegally entering the country while traversing his land. Some dress in all camouflage, he said, while others use 'carpet shoes' to conceal their prints - footwear he often finds left behind on his cattle farm just south of Arivaca.</figcaption><span class="copyright">AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/13/10/81186253-0-image-a-65_1707819603496.jpg" /><figcaption>This comes as the the Tucson Border Sector - where Chilton's farm is located - grapples with a significant increase in crossings from Mexico, as an abnormal influx seen under the Biden Administration continues to cause more crossings in places outside of Texas. 'The problem in [the] area,' Chilton said, is that 'in the last three years [the number of migrants using this route] has intensified immensely. 'They're entering our country unseen, and they could be terrorists,' he continued, producing still from his cameras he says has recorded thousands of illegals traversing his farm. 'Secure the international boundary and develop a program to bring people into this country legally,' he said, calling on lawmakers for a solution.

'We also had another massive victory that every conservative should celebrate,' Trump said at a rally Saturday 'We crushed ¿ Joe Biden's disastrous open borders bill. We crushed it,' Those comments came after conservatives did away with a long-discussed that included some $14 billion in aid to Israel, $60 billion to Ukraine, and $20 billion for securing the southern border. The bill would have also given Biden and Homeland Security the means to close the border if migrant encounters ever reached a certain threshold, as well as some $650 million to go toward border wall construction.</figcaption><span class="copyright">AP</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/13/10/79140511-0-image-a-67_1707819624801.jpg" /><figcaption>From the outset, GOP leaders in both chambers criticized the bill, leaving to months of talks and hopes of compromise - which ultimately fell flat Friday. Back in December, during another interview with Fox, Arizona lawmaker Juan Ciscomani cited the current state of the Tucson Sector compared to other communities in Texas and New York. 'Tucson Sector is leading in encounters and our agents and officers are overrun and undermanned,' Ciscomani writes in the initial request, penned hours before senators issued a statement revealing another popular port of entry would close amid the influx of arrivals. 'The situation is far past a breaking point and those on the frontlines of this crisis are in need of immediate support,' he added, citing the 3,000 encounters seen at the Tuscon Center on Thursday.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/13/10/81128637-0-image-a-69_1707819646846.jpg" /><figcaption>Demanding immediate federal intervention, the rep stated: 'We must be doing all we can to help our local communities, law enforcement officers, and CBP agents and officers. No one knows the gravity of this situation better than our local officials,' he went on, as the Lukeville Port of Entry 150 miles west was similarly overrun. He urged Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas (pictured), who assumed to top spot at Homeland Security in 2021, to 'consider' his request. 'I urge you to work with Governor Katie Hobbs, as well as Arizona county supervisors, mayors and sheriffs,' he said. 'I look forward to your timely response.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">NBC News</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/13/10/78529925-0-image-a-70_1707819683748.jpg" /><figcaption>For months, Cisomani's (pictured) calls went unanswered - that is until Sunday, when Homeland Security's Mayorkas labeled record high numbers of migrant crossings on the southern border a 'crisis' but said 'we don't bear responsibility for a broken system.' Mayorkas - who was nearly impeached last week in a 214-216 vote - was pressed on his handling of the border on Meet the Press on Sunday, saying: 'It certainly is a crisis, and, well, we don't bear responsibility for a broken system. And we're doing a tremendous amount within that broken system.' He added: 'Fundamentally, fundamentally, Congress is the only one who can fix it.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">FOX News</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/13/10/81128645-0-image-a-71_1707819699869.jpg" /><figcaption>He was referring to Republicans last week blocking the bipartisan border deal that would have increased regulations and limited crossings. Mayorkas also dismissed Republicans' failed attempts to impeach him over his handling of the border crisis as 'baseless allegations' claiming 'I am really not distracted by them.' Meanwhile, officials have encountered 169 people on the FBI terror watchlist crossing the southern border in fiscal year 2023 - more than the previous year's 98 encounters, which at the time was a record. It's also more than the last six years combined, as more 302,000 people crossed the border illegally in December.</figcaption><span class="copyright">EPA</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/13/10/81186435-0-image-a-72_1707819713491.jpg" /><figcaption>That's the highest total for a single month ever recorded in history and it marks the first time migrant encounters have reached over 300,000. 'I'm really concerned,' Chilton said. 'If our adversaries around the world want to bring terrorists into our country, this is a route.' With the farm that's been in his family for five generations hanging in the balance, he begged for a swift solution.</figcaption><span class="copyright">AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/13/10/61684721-0-Want_more_stories_like_this_from_the_Daily_Mail_Hit_the_follow_b-a-73_1707819722800.jpg" /><figcaption>Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

But what infuriated the player and what he said to the Kansas City coach as he manhandled him and sent him off balance was unclear. Now DailyMail.com can reveal that the tight end shouted, 'Keep me in. You [expletive]! I'm calm now!' - after lip readers decoded the pair's viral exchange. Kelce, 34, erupted in anger during Sunday's match after his teammates fumbled a pass made by quarterback Patrick Mahomes.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81156949-13074809-He_then_body_bumped_Reid_causing_him_to_momentarily_lose_his_bal-a-22_1707755153827.jpg" /><figcaption>He then body bumped Reid, causing him to momentarily lose his balance, grabbed his arm, and began shouting at him - as his pop star girlfriend Taylor Swift watched from the $1 million family suite at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. His teammate Jerrod McKinnon pulled Kelce away from the 65-year-old coach, ending the heated altercation. Kelce, refusing to discuss the incident in detail, said in the aftermath of the team's victory that his rage was down to the fact that he 'wanted the score to be different' and that Reid is 'one of the best leaders of men I've ever seen in my life.' Kelce was apparently unhappy about not being on the field when Isiah Pacheco fumbled the ball with the Chiefs eight yards out looking for their first touchdown.</figcaption><span class="copyright">None</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81141525-13074809-Approaching_from_the_side_cameras_caught_Kelce_storming_towards_-a-26_1707755154056.jpg" /><figcaption>Approaching from the side, cameras caught Kelce storming towards Reid and bumping into him, causing him to temporarily lose his footing. The pair's interaction set off a social media firestorm as viewers speculated about what was said. But Kelce, speaking to reporters after the Chiefs' dramatic 25-22 win, refused to share. He said: 'You guys saw that? 'I'm going to keep it between us unless my mic'd up tells the world. I was just telling him how much I loved him.' Although he didn't publicly apologize for the altercation, Kelce had nothing but praise for his long-term coach and dedicated their Super Bowl comeback win to him after the game. He told ESPN SportsCenter after the win: 'Man, I was fired up ¿ I was fired up that we weren't hitting on all cylinders.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81135997-13074809-_I_had_to_give_Big_Red_a_love_tap_and_let_him_know_that_we_were_-a-28_1707755154057.jpg" /><figcaption>'I had to give 'Big Red' a love tap and let him know that we were all here fighting for him no matter what. I just had to tell him I loved him real quick. 'I put so much trust in him and how he goes about being a head coach, as a leader ¿ he's one of the best leaders in the game. I can't thank him enough for giving me opportunities year in, and year out. This third one, this second one back-to-back, this one's for him, no doubt.' Kelce added: 'I've got the greatest coach this game has ever seen. 'And he's helped me a lot with that, with channeling that emotion, with channeling that passion. I owe my entire career to that guy and being able to kind of control how emotional I get and just love him.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">AP</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81141521-13074809-Reid_also_played_down_the_altercation_claiming_that_Kelce_just_w-a-23_1707755154050.jpg" /><figcaption>Reid also played down the altercation, claiming that Kelce just wanted to be on the field. 'He just wants to be on the field and he wants to play. There's nobody I get better than I get him. He's a competitive kid, and he loves to play. He makes me feel young.' 'He caught me off balance. I wasn't watching. He was really coming over [and saying], 'Just put me in, I'll score. I'll score.' So, that's really what it was. I love that. It's not the first time. I appreciate him.' 'The part I love is he loves to play the game and he wants to help his team win. It's not a selfish thing. That's not what it is. I understand that. As much as he bumps into me, I get after him and we understand that. He just caught me off balance.' Reid, recalling the incident to ESPN, also revealed: 'He came over and gave me a hug, said 'Sorry about that'.</figcaption><span class="copyright">REUTERS</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81139585-13074809-The_Super_Bowl_was_not_the_first_time_that_Kelce_was_seen_suffer-a-24_1707755154052.jpg" /><figcaption>The Super Bowl was not the first time that Kelce was seen suffering an on-field meltdown. On Christmas Day, he had another tete-a-tete with coach Reid , and was spotted slamming his helmet to the floor during a 20-14 loss to the Las Vegas Raiders . When a staff member tried to hand it back to the tight end so that he could take the field, Reid grabbed the helmet and refused to give it back. Regardless of the actual reasons for the tiff, social media reacted with hilarity, comparing the spat to sandwich orders, anger over a potential remake of the 1990s hit movie Twister and a debate of the best T. Swift era. With the notable exception of his furious sideline outburst at Reid, the only peep Kelce made over the first two quarters was a single catch on a single target for a single yard.</figcaption><span class="copyright">AP</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81157977-13074809-Then_the_man_known_to_many_as_Mr_Taylor_Swift_started_making_noi-a-25_1707755154055.jpg" /><figcaption>Then the man known to many as Mr. Taylor Swift started making noise. It wasn't an overwhelming production ¿ nine catches for 93 yards ¿ but for the Chiefs and one of their emotional leaders, it helped change momentum. The San Francisco 49ers defense that had stifled Kansas City in the first half suddenly became vulnerable, the relentless pass rush of Nick Bosa and Chase Young slowed down somewhat, and the breaks that had been going against the Chiefs suddenly went in their favor. By the end of regulation, Kelce was making a ruckus, barreling over 49ers defenders to set up the Chiefs' game-tying field goal and force overtime, where he picked up a key first down deep in 49ers territory.</figcaption><span class="copyright">USA TODAY Sports via Reuters Con</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81148893-13074809-That_play_a_gritty_seven_yard_gain_down_to_3_yard_line_would_set-a-30_1707755154144.jpg" /><figcaption>That play - a gritty seven-yard gain down to 3-yard line - would set up Patrick Mahomes' game-winning touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman. And with the 25-22 victory in hand, Kelce and the Chiefs were champions for the third time in five years. During the game, Kelce had his entire family in a VIP suite that he personally paid over $1million for - with the most notable guest, Swift, flying all the way from Tokyo for the game. Swift was performing a fourth Eras Tour show in Japan on Saturday night, where she then hot-footed it straight to a private jet at the airport to get back to America. She then spent Saturday night at her home in LA, before boarding another jet to Vegas in time for the big game on Sunday afternoon.</figcaption><span class="copyright">PA</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81157879-13074809-Travis_brother_Jason_was_also_present_with_his_wife_Kelce_while_-a-29_1707755154137.jpg" /><figcaption>Travis' brother Jason was also present with his wife Kelce, while their mom Donna and dad Ed were also both there. Swift's parents Scott and Andrea joined the group in the box, while Taylor brought some friends too - including Blake Lively and Ice Spice. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell also made an appearance in the box before the game and was spotted deep in conversation with Swift. The Chiefs last night became the first back-to-back Super Bowl winners in 19 years with a 25-22 overtime win over the 49ers in Las Vegas. Needing a field goal to extend the game or a touchdown to win, Mahomes orchestrated the match-winning drive to end the game with a touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman Jr.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81144695-13074809-The_49ers_were_leading_by_three_in_overtime_after_they_opted_for-a-31_1707755154148.jpg" /><figcaption>The 49ers were leading by three in overtime after they opted for a field goal to go ahead 22-19, but were unable to get the decisive stop. It was the second time in NFL history a Super Bowl went to overtime and the first post-season game decided under the league's new overtime rules. The only points in the first quarter came through kicker Jake Moody, who made Super Bowl history with the longest made field goal at 55 yards. Disaster struck 49ers' linebacker Dre Greenlaw early in the second quarter when he went down with a suspected Achilles injury while running onto the field and was immediately ruled out of the game.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81138957-13074809-But_not_long_after_a_special_trick_play_led_to_the_first_touchdo-a-33_1707755154152.jpg" /><figcaption>But not long after, a special trick-play led to the first touchdown of the game, with Purdy passing across field to wide-receiver Jauan Jennings before he threw a pass to Christian McCaffrey who ran through to the endzone untouched. The 49ers restricted Kelce to just one touch for one yard in the first half and sacked Mahomes twice, with the 49ers ahead 10-3 at halftime. As play resumed, Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker broke Moody's Super Bowl record with a 57-yard field goal before a fumble error gave the Chiefs a huge chance for their first touchdown.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81158595-13074809-Mahomes_found_wide_receiver_Marquez_Valdes_Scantling_with_a_16_y-a-32_1707755154151.jpg" /><figcaption>Mahomes found wide-receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling with a 16-yard touchdown pass to take the lead for the first time in the game late in the third quarter. However the 49ers hit back ¿ with Purdy finding Jennings this time to score his own touchdown ¿ however the bonus point was blocked, giving the 49ers a three-point lead with 11 minutes left. A field goal to Butker tied the game once again, before Moody struck back to give the 49ers the lead again with less than two minutes left. However, Butker finished regulation time with a field goal with six seconds left to tie the game 19-19.

And although the blockbuster was consigned to the realms of sci-fi, the science behind the frightening scenario is true. In a matter of years, melting glaciers could shut down the Gulf Stream - the system of currents that brings warmth to the northern hemisphere, experts say.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Atlas Photo Archive/NASA</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/14/73597383-0-image-a-196_1707748517140.jpg" /><figcaption>Without this additional heat source, average temperatures could drop by several degrees in North America, parts of Asia and Europe, and people would see 'severe and cascading consequences around the world'. Scientists warn that an abrupt shutdown of Atlantic Ocean currents is looking more likely than ever, as computer simulations find a 'cliff-like' tipping point looming in the near future.</figcaption><span class="copyright">© Twentieth Century Fox</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/14/81162569-0-The_study_authors_from_Utrecht_University_in_the_Netherlands_don-m-203_1707748627680.jpg" /><figcaption>The study authors, from Utrecht University in the Netherlands, don't know exactly when the collapse will happen, although a previous study put it as soon as next year. 'We are moving closer to the collapse, but we're not sure how much closer,' said lead author Rene van Westen, a climate scientist and oceanographer at Utrecht University. 'We are heading towards a tipping point.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">Alamy Stock Photo</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/14/39772864-0-image-a-197_1707748526910.jpg" /><figcaption>When a global weather calamity like the one in The Day After Tomorrow may happen is 'the million-dollar question', according to van Westen. 'We unfortunately can't answer [that] at the moment,' he said. 'It also depends on the rate of climate change we are inducing as humanity.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">© INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/14/81162579-0-image-a-204_1707748646951.jpg" /><figcaption>The Gulf Stream is part of a much wider system of currents, officially called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation or AMOC. Described as 'the conveyor belt of the ocean', it transports warm water near the ocean's surface northwards ¿ from the tropics up to the northern hemisphere.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Alamy Stock Photo</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/14/81151561-0-image-a-198_1707748535738.jpg" /><figcaption>When the warm water reaches the North Atlantic (around Europe and the UK, and the US east coast), it releases the heat and freezes. As this ice forms, salt is left behind in the ocean water. Due to the large amount of salt in the water, it becomes denser, sinks, and is carried southwards in the depths below. Eventually, the water gets pulled back up towards the surface and warms up in a process called upwelling, completing the cycle. Scientists think AMOC brings enough warmth to the northern hemisphere that without it, large parts of Europe could enter a deep freeze.</figcaption><span class="copyright">None</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/14/54472079-0-image-a-199_1707748543381.jpg" /><figcaption>Prior studies have already shown that due to climate change, the AMOC is slowing down. The engine of this conveyor belt is off the coast of Greenland, where, as more ice melts from climate change, more freshwater flows into the North Atlantic and slows everything down. The new study forecasts that an abrupt shutdown of the AMOC could happen in the next few decades, rather than the next few centuries as previously thought. The researchers designed a computer modelling simulation in which they were able to measure a sudden weakening of the ocean circulation.</figcaption><span class="copyright">None</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/14/39811548-0-image-a-200_1707748554316.jpg" /><figcaption>The simulation introduced freshwater into the Atlantic Ocean, and as a result, the circulation strength gradually decreased until it reached a critical 'tipping point' and collapsed. According to the results, the European climate will cool by about 1.8°F (1°C) per decade, and some regions will even experience over 5.4°F (3°C) cooling per decade ¿ much faster than today¿s global warming of about 0.36 F (0.2 C) per decade.</figcaption><span class="copyright">© Public Domain</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/14/81154593-0-image-a-201_1707748563863.jpg" /><figcaption>Aside from plunging countries into a deep freeze, this would extend Arctic ice further south, turn up the heat even more in the southern hemisphere, change global rainfall patterns and disrupt the Amazon rainforest. Other scientists say it would be a catastrophe that could cause worldwide food and water shortages. 'We found that once it reaches the tipping point, the conveyor belt shuts down within 100 years,' the authors said. 'The heat transport toward the north is strongly reduced, leading to abrupt climate shifts.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">None</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/14/81162573-0-The_one_thing_they_couldn_t_identify_is_when_exactly_this_tippin-m-207_1707748670654.jpg" /><figcaption>The one thing they couldn't identify is when exactly this tipping point will be reached, although it is at least decades away if not longer. 'The research makes a convincing case that the AMOC is approaching a tipping point based on a robust, physically-based early warning indicator,' said Tim Lenton, chairman in climate change at University of Exeter, who was not involved with the study. 'What it cannot (and does not) say is how close the tipping point, because as it shows that there is insufficient data to make a statistically reliable estimate of that.' The study has been published in the journal Science Advances.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Alamy Stock Photo</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/14/61684721-0-Want_more_stories_like_this_from_the_Daily_Mail_Hit_the_follow_b-a-208_1707748679614.jpg" /><figcaption>Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

But what infuriated the player and what he said to the Kansas City coach as he manhandled him and sent him off balance was unclear. Now DailyMail.com can reveal that the tight end shouted, 'Keep me in. You [expletive]! I'm calm now!' - after lip readers decoded the pair's viral exchange. Kelce, 34, erupted in anger during Sunday's match after his teammates fumbled a pass made by quarterback Patrick Mahomes.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81156949-13074809-He_then_body_bumped_Reid_causing_him_to_momentarily_lose_his_bal-a-22_1707755153827.jpg" /><figcaption>He then body bumped Reid, causing him to momentarily lose his balance, grabbed his arm, and began shouting at him - as his pop star girlfriend Taylor Swift watched from the $1 million family suite at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. His teammate Jerrod McKinnon pulled Kelce away from the 65-year-old coach, ending the heated altercation. Kelce, refusing to discuss the incident in detail, said in the aftermath of the team's victory that his rage was down to the fact that he 'wanted the score to be different' and that Reid is 'one of the best leaders of men I've ever seen in my life.' Kelce was apparently unhappy about not being on the field when Isiah Pacheco fumbled the ball with the Chiefs eight yards out looking for their first touchdown.</figcaption><span class="copyright">None</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81141525-13074809-Approaching_from_the_side_cameras_caught_Kelce_storming_towards_-a-26_1707755154056.jpg" /><figcaption>Approaching from the side, cameras caught Kelce storming towards Reid and bumping into him, causing him to temporarily lose his footing. The pair's interaction set off a social media firestorm as viewers speculated about what was said. But Kelce, speaking to reporters after the Chiefs' dramatic 25-22 win, refused to share. He said: 'You guys saw that? 'I'm going to keep it between us unless my mic'd up tells the world. I was just telling him how much I loved him.' Although he didn't publicly apologize for the altercation, Kelce had nothing but praise for his long-term coach and dedicated their Super Bowl comeback win to him after the game. He told ESPN SportsCenter after the win: 'Man, I was fired up ¿ I was fired up that we weren't hitting on all cylinders.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81135997-13074809-_I_had_to_give_Big_Red_a_love_tap_and_let_him_know_that_we_were_-a-28_1707755154057.jpg" /><figcaption>'I had to give 'Big Red' a love tap and let him know that we were all here fighting for him no matter what. I just had to tell him I loved him real quick. 'I put so much trust in him and how he goes about being a head coach, as a leader ¿ he's one of the best leaders in the game. I can't thank him enough for giving me opportunities year in, and year out. This third one, this second one back-to-back, this one's for him, no doubt.' Kelce added: 'I've got the greatest coach this game has ever seen. 'And he's helped me a lot with that, with channeling that emotion, with channeling that passion. I owe my entire career to that guy and being able to kind of control how emotional I get and just love him.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">AP</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81141521-13074809-Reid_also_played_down_the_altercation_claiming_that_Kelce_just_w-a-23_1707755154050.jpg" /><figcaption>Reid also played down the altercation, claiming that Kelce just wanted to be on the field. 'He just wants to be on the field and he wants to play. There's nobody I get better than I get him. He's a competitive kid, and he loves to play. He makes me feel young.' 'He caught me off balance. I wasn't watching. He was really coming over [and saying], 'Just put me in, I'll score. I'll score.' So, that's really what it was. I love that. It's not the first time. I appreciate him.' 'The part I love is he loves to play the game and he wants to help his team win. It's not a selfish thing. That's not what it is. I understand that. As much as he bumps into me, I get after him and we understand that. He just caught me off balance.' Reid, recalling the incident to ESPN, also revealed: 'He came over and gave me a hug, said 'Sorry about that'.</figcaption><span class="copyright">REUTERS</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81139585-13074809-The_Super_Bowl_was_not_the_first_time_that_Kelce_was_seen_suffer-a-24_1707755154052.jpg" /><figcaption>The Super Bowl was not the first time that Kelce was seen suffering an on-field meltdown. On Christmas Day, he had another tete-a-tete with coach Reid , and was spotted slamming his helmet to the floor during a 20-14 loss to the Las Vegas Raiders . When a staff member tried to hand it back to the tight end so that he could take the field, Reid grabbed the helmet and refused to give it back. Regardless of the actual reasons for the tiff, social media reacted with hilarity, comparing the spat to sandwich orders, anger over a potential remake of the 1990s hit movie Twister and a debate of the best T. Swift era. With the notable exception of his furious sideline outburst at Reid, the only peep Kelce made over the first two quarters was a single catch on a single target for a single yard.</figcaption><span class="copyright">AP</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81157977-13074809-Then_the_man_known_to_many_as_Mr_Taylor_Swift_started_making_noi-a-25_1707755154055.jpg" /><figcaption>Then the man known to many as Mr. Taylor Swift started making noise. It wasn't an overwhelming production ¿ nine catches for 93 yards ¿ but for the Chiefs and one of their emotional leaders, it helped change momentum. The San Francisco 49ers defense that had stifled Kansas City in the first half suddenly became vulnerable, the relentless pass rush of Nick Bosa and Chase Young slowed down somewhat, and the breaks that had been going against the Chiefs suddenly went in their favor. By the end of regulation, Kelce was making a ruckus, barreling over 49ers defenders to set up the Chiefs' game-tying field goal and force overtime, where he picked up a key first down deep in 49ers territory.</figcaption><span class="copyright">USA TODAY Sports via Reuters Con</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81148893-13074809-That_play_a_gritty_seven_yard_gain_down_to_3_yard_line_would_set-a-30_1707755154144.jpg" /><figcaption>That play - a gritty seven-yard gain down to 3-yard line - would set up Patrick Mahomes' game-winning touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman. And with the 25-22 victory in hand, Kelce and the Chiefs were champions for the third time in five years. During the game, Kelce had his entire family in a VIP suite that he personally paid over $1million for - with the most notable guest, Swift, flying all the way from Tokyo for the game. Swift was performing a fourth Eras Tour show in Japan on Saturday night, where she then hot-footed it straight to a private jet at the airport to get back to America. She then spent Saturday night at her home in LA, before boarding another jet to Vegas in time for the big game on Sunday afternoon.</figcaption><span class="copyright">PA</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81157879-13074809-Travis_brother_Jason_was_also_present_with_his_wife_Kelce_while_-a-29_1707755154137.jpg" /><figcaption>Travis' brother Jason was also present with his wife Kelce, while their mom Donna and dad Ed were also both there. Swift's parents Scott and Andrea joined the group in the box, while Taylor brought some friends too - including Blake Lively and Ice Spice. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell also made an appearance in the box before the game and was spotted deep in conversation with Swift. The Chiefs last night became the first back-to-back Super Bowl winners in 19 years with a 25-22 overtime win over the 49ers in Las Vegas. Needing a field goal to extend the game or a touchdown to win, Mahomes orchestrated the match-winning drive to end the game with a touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman Jr.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81144695-13074809-The_49ers_were_leading_by_three_in_overtime_after_they_opted_for-a-31_1707755154148.jpg" /><figcaption>The 49ers were leading by three in overtime after they opted for a field goal to go ahead 22-19, but were unable to get the decisive stop. It was the second time in NFL history a Super Bowl went to overtime and the first post-season game decided under the league's new overtime rules. The only points in the first quarter came through kicker Jake Moody, who made Super Bowl history with the longest made field goal at 55 yards. Disaster struck 49ers' linebacker Dre Greenlaw early in the second quarter when he went down with a suspected Achilles injury while running onto the field and was immediately ruled out of the game.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81138957-13074809-But_not_long_after_a_special_trick_play_led_to_the_first_touchdo-a-33_1707755154152.jpg" /><figcaption>But not long after, a special trick-play led to the first touchdown of the game, with Purdy passing across field to wide-receiver Jauan Jennings before he threw a pass to Christian McCaffrey who ran through to the endzone untouched. The 49ers restricted Kelce to just one touch for one yard in the first half and sacked Mahomes twice, with the 49ers ahead 10-3 at halftime. As play resumed, Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker broke Moody's Super Bowl record with a 57-yard field goal before a fumble error gave the Chiefs a huge chance for their first touchdown.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/12/16/81158595-13074809-Mahomes_found_wide_receiver_Marquez_Valdes_Scantling_with_a_16_y-a-32_1707755154151.jpg" /><figcaption>Mahomes found wide-receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling with a 16-yard touchdown pass to take the lead for the first time in the game late in the third quarter. However the 49ers hit back ¿ with Purdy finding Jennings this time to score his own touchdown ¿ however the bonus point was blocked, giving the 49ers a three-point lead with 11 minutes left. A field goal to Butker tied the game once again, before Moody struck back to give the 49ers the lead again with less than two minutes left. However, Butker finished regulation time with a field goal with six seconds left to tie the game 19-19.
