<p class="mol-para-with-font">Long before anesthesia and the advent of precision medical tools, humans were already performing complex surgeries on one another in effort to beat all sorts of ailments.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Among the most gruesome may be the act of trepanation – in which parts of the skull were scraped, cut, or drilled away to treat everything from headaches or injuries to suspected demonic possession.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hundreds of prehistoric skulls bearing the tell-tale holes of trepanation have been found in Peru alone, dating as far back as the year 400 B.C.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite their prehistoric methods, researchers say the ancient neurosurgeons were experts at the task; during the Inca Empire, the survival rate for the procedure was roughly double what was achieved centuries later during the American Civil War.</p><img id="i-5885cd4269166b7d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/20/4D239A5D00000578-0-image-a-6_1528746049292.jpg" height="357" width="634" alt="According to a new study published to the journal World Neurosurgery, more than 800 skulls found in the Andean highlands of Peru show signs of trepanation, having one or more holes surgically cut into them" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There are still many unknowns about the procedure and the individuals on whom trepanation was performed, but the outcomes during the Civil War were dismal compared to Incan times,’ said David S. Kushner, clinical professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University of Miami.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘In Incan times, the mortality rate was between 17 and 25 percent, and during the Civil War, it was between 46 and 56 percent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘That’s a big difference. The question is how did the ancient Peruvian surgeons have outcomes that far surpassed those of surgeons during the American Civil War?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to a new study published to the journal World Neurosurgery, more than 800 skulls found in the Andean highlands of Peru show signs of trepanation, having one or more holes surgically cut into them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While this practice is known to have occurred all over the world, the experts say no area comes even close to matching Peru’s history with trepanation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The hundreds of skulls, mostly found in burial caves and during excavations in the late 1800s and early 1900s, account for more trepanned skulls than all found in the rest of the world combined.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to the researchers, hygiene likely played a key role in the success of Peru’s prehistoric cranial surgeries.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, over nearly 2,000 years, these ancient surgeons refined their techniques to cause as little damage as possible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The same could not be said for the Civil War surgeons, who often relied on unsterilized tools and probed open head wounds with their bare fingers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The researchers were able to gauge survival of the patients based on evidence of healing activity; in situations where no signs of healing were present, they assumed the patient died during or soon after the surgery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘If there was an opening in the skull they would poke a finger into the wound and feel around, exploring for clots and bone fragments,’ Kushner said, of the Civil War era surgeries.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We do not know how the ancient Peruvians prevented infection, but it seems that they did a good job of it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Neither do we know what they used as anaesthesia, but since there were so many they must have used something – possibly coca leaves.</p><img id="i-191ccc991919712e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/20/4D239A5500000578-0-image-a-7_1528746080822.jpg" height="386" width="634" alt="Evidence of trepanation can be found all over the world, dating back thousands of years.

There are no written records, so we just don’t know.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to the researchers, the ancient Peruvians learned not to cut into the protective membrane around the brain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the earliest years, the survival rate was not great – from about 400 to 200 BC, it was even worse than those in the Civil War.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, things changed dramatically over the next few centuries.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From the year 1000 to 1400 AD, survival rates jumped to as high as 91 percent in some samples.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During the Inca period, survival was at an average of 75 to 83 percent.</p><mol-permabox id="mol-7b38bb20-6daf-11e8-8916-3f0dbc4e0302"></mol-permabox><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Over time, from the earliest to the latest, they learned which techniques were better, and less likely to perforate the dura,’ Kushner says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘They seemed to understand head anatomy and purposefully avoided the areas where there would be more bleeding.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘They also realized that larger-sized trepanations were less likely to be as successful as smaller ones.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Physical evidence definitely shows that these ancient surgeons refined the procedure over time.

class="mol-para-with-font">Born on June 11, 1847, in Aldeburgh in Suffolk, Millicent is primarily known for her work as a women’s suffrage campaigner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The sister of Britain’s first female doctor Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, who first introduced her to feminist Emily Davies, Millicent had been encouraged to get involved with politics from a young age.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After hearing John Stuart Mill’s speech on universal women’s rights, she became active in his campaign from the age of 19.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With other women, Millicent formed a discussion group called the Kensington Society and after collecting signatures for the first petition for women’s suffrage, she became the secretary of the London Society for Women’s Suffrage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was then introduced to Liberal MP Henry Fawcett, who had at first intended to marry her sister Elizabeth but because she decided to embark on a medical career, Henry and Millicent were wedded on April 23 1867.</p><img id="i-87fc37d8a74b43bb"

London Suffrage Committee, beginning her speaking tours around the UK for the suffragist movement, different to the suffragettes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After her husband’s death and a subsequent hiatus from public life, she forged ahead in her campaign for women’s rights and became the leader of the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Millicent was in this role a year after the first women had been given the vote in the Representation of the People Act 1918.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She also played a significant role in the founding of Newham College, the second Cambridge university college to admit women.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As well as this, Millicent led an all-female troop into the British concentration camps in <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/news/south_africa/index.html">South Africa</a> during the Boer War.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before her death in 1929, a year after women were granted the vote on equal terms to men, she was appointed a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE).</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Processions 2018</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Women all over the UK led mass <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class"

The report cited excessive hours, low wages, poor training and an overreliance on 'dispatch' or temporary workers in violation of Chinese law at the Hunan province plant. Foxconn is the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and employs more than a million people. The company, which also makes iPhones for Apple, came under fire in 2010 for a spate of suicides at plants in China. Foxconn pledged to improve working conditions.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>Reuters</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Wires</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T12:03:54.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Amazon slammed for major 'labour violations' at Chinese factory</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T12:03:54.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5827877/Always-use-fresh-tea-towel-drying-old-cloth-boosts-food-poisoning-risk.html" title="Always use a fresh tea towel!

If they were under attack or forced to flee - a sensible arrangement considering relations with the locals - the colonists were to carve a Maltese cross into a tree.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was no evidence of such a carved cross, but White's men found two trees.

He never returned.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A voyage by Sir Walter Raleigh 12 years later in 1602 also ended when bad weather forced the expedition to return to England.

Other sources of funding came from Oldham District General Hospital and the Ford Foundation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a separate paper, Dr Elder points out: ‘It is of interest that two of the major breakthroughs in reproductive medicine in the twentieth century were both facilitated by enlightened financial support from wealthy strong-minded women’ - IVF by Lillian Howell and the contraceptive pill by Katherine McCormick.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lillian Howell was fond of writing comical poetry. One example ‘Man likes upon his “lady fair”/ A bit of plumpness here and there/ But be that plumpness out of kilter/ Sure enough the man will jilt her.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Elder said that Lillian ‘shunned publicity’ and Sir Bob his wife Ruth were adamant that this wish should be respected in her lifetime, but her death on 31 August 2014 legitimately allows her identity to be revealed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Louise Brown’s spokesman Martin Powell said yesterday: ‘Louise was not aware of this donation but is grateful to all of those who helped IVF happen.

The demise of the Aral Sea came at the expense of the Uzbek cotton industry, which still thrives today.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Aaron Brown</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-08T18:49:16.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Haunting images reveal the demise of the Aral Sea</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-08T18:49:16.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5820597/Rotting-remains-mysterious-20-foot-long-sea-creature-washed-beach-Namibia.html" title="The rotting remains of a mysterious 20-foot long sea creature are found washed up on an idyllic Namibian beach, leaving scientists baffled"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5820513/Sientients-origins-bacterium-Black-Death-3-800-year-old-skeletons.html" title="Bubonic plague started in the Bronze Age: Scientists discover the ancestor to the Black Death in a pair of 3,800-year-old skeletons"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5820581/E-Scooters-causing-chaos-streets-shouting-Unlock-Ill-call-police.html" title="Electric scooters are causing chaos on US streets by shouting 'unlock me or I'll call the police' at passersby"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5818399/Google-bars-uses-artificial-intelligence-tech-weapons.html" title="Google bans the uses of its AI tech in weapons and 'unreasonable surveillance systems' - but says it will continue to work with the military on other projects"></link></item><item><title>The rotting remains of a mysterious 20-foot long sea creature are found washed up on an idyllic Namibian beach, leaving scientists baffled</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5820597/Rotting-remains-mysterious-20-foot-long-sea-creature-washed-beach-Namibia.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2018 10:31:03 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5820597</guid><description><![CDATA[Stunned researchers stumbled across the 19ft 6in (six-metre) beaked carcass last week on the idyllic coastline of Dorob National Park, Namibia.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

The post gathered more than 1,400 likes and was shared over 1,200 times as people warned each other to be prepared when hitting the outdoors.

Dark Sword, pictured in prototype form in the main image, could give China a huge advantage if its military is able to mass-produce the aircraft as it could rapidly expand its fighter fleet without training new pilots, according to British defence experts.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ellie Zolfagharifard</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T19:45:45.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>China unveils unmanned 'Dark Sword' stealth combat drone</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T19:45:45.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>China</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5811407/Instagram-soon-let-post-videos-hour-long.html" title="Instagram could soon feature videos that are up to an HOUR long in an effort to take on YouTube"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5804697/Animals-turns-communicating-wait-turn-just-like-polite-humans-do.html" title="Animals have better manners than some humans!

</div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">1. 'Dogs have a human appreciation of sharing'</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Humans can rationalise and appreciate the benefits of sharing. In contrast, among dogs, possession is ten-tenths of the law.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So we should not take toys, bones and chews away from dogs unless we have trained them to accept this form of intervention.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">2. 'Dogs always enjoy common human physical displays of affection'</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Humans often show their affection for others by hugging and cuddling them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dogs simply do not have the limbs and joints to achieve this and so have not evolved to give each other a loving squeeze. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When embraced by humans, many can find this uncomfortable or threatening. The same goes for patting dogs on the head.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">3. 'Barking and growling dogs are always threatening or dangerous'</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">These are distance-increasing behaviours. The dogs using these signals are chiefly trying to buy space so they can feel safer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All dogs, regardless of their temperament or training, can at times want more space. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They usually try more subtle signalling first, but many dogs learn that subtle signals don't work and go straight for shouting.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">4. 'Dogs will welcome unfamiliar dogs to their home'</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dogs evolved from wolves and are therefore primed to defend what is theirs. They have an attachment to their home territory and the resources within it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dogs have no way of knowing that the dogs and human we invite around to our home, for example for a play-date, are ever going to leave.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They can be forgiven for thinking that this is the way it is going to be from hereon.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So it is to be expected that they will often try to lay out the local ground-rules and put the new arrivals in their place.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">5. 'Dogs like relaxing as much as humans do'</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">We go to work and go to school, so we greatly value the opportunity to chill out at home and maybe watch TV.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In contrast, dogs spend most of their time at home and so value exercise off the property far more than time spent on the sofa.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, for dogs, a change is not just as good as a rest – it's much better.</p><mol-permabox id="mol-5a0baa40-65b5-11e8-9527-07ba05869802"></mol-permabox><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">6. 'An effusive dog is a friendly dog'</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Friendly' for one dog is not friendly for all dogs, and some dogs use excessive friendliness as a way to alleviate anxiety associated with meeting another dog or human.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Owners of very friendly dogs may be surprised when every other dog does not cheerfully receive their dog.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some dogs prefer sedate greetings, and lots of personal space.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">7. 'Dogs approach when they want to engage playfully'</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sometimes owners are confused when a dog approaches a human or another dog in a friendly fashion and then growls or snaps at them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These dogs may be motivated to approach chiefly to gain information, rather than to interact, and some may like strangers in principle, but nevertheless become anxious and overwhelmed all of a sudden.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are seeing this pattern, call your dog away from new dogs and humans after a couple of seconds.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">8. 'A big yard can replace walks'</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Because dogs spend so much time at home in the yard, they often find the area a little too familiar and sometimes rather dull.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The size of a yard is far less important to dogs than what happens in it. Dogs truly thrive on play with each other, with us and with toys.</p><mol-permabox id="mol-bc202f10-65b2-11e8-8760-dfee4a435c7d"></mol-permabox><img id="i-e017125cd9ab0502" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/01/11/4CCEDFA100000578-5794675-image-a-7_1527848374663.jpg" height="420" width="634" alt="There are many ways in which we can misjudge dogs by assuming that they are little furry humans. These include hugging them like people and expecting them to share, like humans do (Stock image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">They particularly love to do so in a novel environment, so time spent out of the yard is the very best of fun.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">9. 'Dogs are wilfully defia<span class="class">nt when they don't do as they are told'</span></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rather than deciding to disobey us, dogs sometimes simply can't do what we ask them to.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Either they don't actually know what we're asking them to do, or they have much, much more pressing things to do at the time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dogs are not great at generalising, so just because they sit nicely when asked to in the kitchen when you have treats in your hand doesn't mean they automatically know what 'sit' means when they are at the off-leash dog park.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And while your dogs might know what 'sit' means when being trained at home without distractions, asking them to do so when visitors are at the door might be like asking a child to kneel and pray upon arriving at an amusement park.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">10. 'Barking, snapping, or lunging is the first sign of an unhappy dog'</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dogs often give subtle signs they are becoming anxious, like avoiding eye contact with whatever is worrying them, licking lips, brow furrows, lifting a paw, tightening muscles in their face.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If nothing is done to help these dogs move away from whatever is worrying them, these signs can often escalate to more troubling behaviour that is more obvious, such as growling and snapping.</p><mol-permabox id="mol-214c5f80-6581-11e8-b13e-cd5a5373aef2"></mol-permabox><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Animal behaviour experts Dr Melissa Starling and Dr Paul McGreevy, from the University of Sydney, have revealed 10 common dog behaviour myths.

The JUUL vapouriser uses nicotine salts, JUULsalts, that are found in the tobacco leaf, rather than free-base nicotine, that standard cigarettes burn. This is what gives vapers the satisfaction that nicotine provides as well as an authentic smoking experience.</p><div class="mol-embed"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its compact and portable design with algorithmic puff consistency and temperature-regulated vapour made it stand out amongst other smoking alternatives and is now the number one independent vapour brand.

The e-liquid formula, or Juice, is heated using an industry standard wick and nichrome coil system.’ Each JUULpod contains 0.7ml of liquid with 5% nicotine by weight, which is equivalent to 1 pack of cigarettes or 200 puffs. JUULpods cannot be refilled.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With investment from the likes of Tiger Global and Fidelity Investment, JUUL are on track to manufacture 20 million JUULpods per month by the end of 2017, up from less than one million per month in January this year.

With their goal to completely eliminate smoking, JUUL has now become the number one vapour product in the United States, according to Nielsen. JUUL was founded by Stanford design student graduates Adam Bowen and James Monsees in 2015 who applied their knowledge of technology innovation and industrial design to create an e-cigarette product.  JUUL Labs CEO Tyler Goldman told CNBC that ‘when people say it's a good problem to have, I think about it a little differently. The company's goal is to switch cigarette users, he said. And to do that, JUUL needs to have enough products to satisfy users' nicotine cravings. To achieve our mission, we really need to make sure that we have enough pods per device, and if we're not getting enough devices out into the marketplace, it means we're not giving people the option to switch to JUUL,’ Goldman said.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Noah Szubski</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-25T22:19:00.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>What is JUUL?

the ease with which machine learning could be used to create fake porn starring a particular person without their consent, along with other malicious content.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, it’s not the first.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Deepfakes has made similar videos of other stars, too, including Taylor Swift and Game of Thrones’ Maisie Williams, according to Motherboard, which

Motherboard.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘With hundreds of face images, I can easily generate millions of distorted images to train the network.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘After that if I

Time and the number of times a battery has been charged are not the only factors in this chemical aging process.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Device use also affects the performance of a battery over its lifespan. For example, leaving or charging a battery in a hot environment can cause a battery to age faster. These are characteristics of battery chemistry, common to lithium-ion batteries across the industry.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A chemically aged battery also becomes less capable of delivering peak energy loads, especially in a low state of charge, which may result in a device unexpectedly shutting itself down in some situations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To help customers learn more about iPhone’s rechargeable battery and the factors affecting its performance, we’ve posted a new support article, iPhone Battery and Performance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It should go without saying that we think sudden, unexpected shutdowns are unacceptable. We don’t want any of our users to lose a call, miss taking a picture or have any other part of their iPhone experience interrupted if we can avoid it.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Preventing unexpected shutdowns </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">About a year ago in iOS 10.2.1, we delivered a software update that improves power management during peak workloads to avoid unexpected shutdowns on iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SE. With the update, iOS dynamically manages the maximum performance of some system components when needed to prevent a shutdown. While these changes may go unnoticed, in some cases users may experience longer launch times for apps and other reductions in performance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Customer response to iOS 10.2.1 was positive, as it successfully reduced the occurrence of unexpected shutdowns. We recently extended the same support for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in iOS 11.2.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, when a chemically aged battery is replaced with a new one, iPhone performance returns to normal when operated in standard conditions.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Recent user feedback</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over the course of this fall, we began to receive feedback from some users who were seeing slower performance in certain situations. Based on our experience, we initially thought this was due to a combination of two factors: a normal, temporary performance impact when upgrading the operating system as iPhone installs new software and updates apps, and minor bugs in the initial release which have since been fixed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We now believe that another contributor to these user experiences is the continued chemical aging of the batteries in older iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s devices, many of which are still running on their original batteries.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Addressing customer concerns </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’ve always wanted our customers to be able to use their iPhones as long as possible. We’re proud that Apple products are known for their durability, and for holding their value longer than our competitors’ devices.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To address our customers’ concerns, to recognize their loyalty and to regain the trust of anyone who may have doubted Apple’s intentions, we’ve decided to take the following steps:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At Apple, our customers’ trust means everything to us.

But following these steps will make it significantly harder for hackers to succeed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA). Most major online services, from Amazon to Apple, today support 2FA.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When it's set up, the system asks for a login and password just like usual – but then sends a unique numeric code to another device, using text message, email or a specialized app.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Without access to that other device, the login is refused. That makes it much harder to hack into someone's account – but users have to enable it themselves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2) Encrypt your internet traffic. A virtual private network (VPN) service encrypts digital communications, making it hard for hackers to intercept them.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Everyone should subscribe to a VPN service, some of which are free, and use it whenever connecting a device to a public or unknown Wi-Fi network.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3) Tighten up your password security.
