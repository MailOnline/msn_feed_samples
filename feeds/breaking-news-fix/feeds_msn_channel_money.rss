<p class="mol-para-with-font">Annual meetings rarely live up to their promise. Nevertheless, the gathering of WPP investors on London’s Southbank tomorrow should be a humdinger.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has all the ingredients for a circus, including lurid allegations against Sir Martin Sorrell and demands from investor advisory group Glass Lewis that chairman Roberto Quarta be removed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There also are questions as to whether former boss Sorrell is really entitled to be treated as a good leaver after a deal cooked up behind closed doors which could gift him up to £20million in share options.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If any of this is hurting Sorrell it is hard to tell. A fortnight ago he was confidently doing the rounds – unescorted – at the Chelsea Flower Show. </p><img id="i-7b93b26d014ba0dd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/21/05145619000007D0-0-image-a-9_1528748086496.jpg" height="418" width="634" alt="WPP's AGM  has all the ingredients for a circus with lurid allegations against ousted boss Sir Martin Sorrell (pictured) and demands that chairman Roberto Quarta be removed" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Moreover, much to the angst of WPP directors he is planning to start an advertising group through the shell company Derriston Capital with backing from veteran financier Lord Rothschild.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The lesson from WPP is that it is never satisfactory for a public company to launch an inquiry involving major transatlantic law firm Wilmer Hale, force out the chief executive and then pretend that the allegations were trifling. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The truth is that the details will eventually out. There is a narrative that says Sorrell’s troubles began when Roberto Quarta was chosen to replace easygoing predecessor Philip Lader as chairman in 2015. Perhaps. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But my own encounter with Quarta, when we met to discuss the chief executive’s pay cheque, was of a chairman in thrall to Sorrell who felt he deserved to be paid like a movie star.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The change of attitude towards Sorrell came with the choice of Nicole Seligman, a high powered Washington lawyer, as senior non-executive director.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her background at Washington litigation firm Williams &amp; Connolly and in defending Bill Clinton during impeachment signals a person who takes no prisoners.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many leaks about Sorrell first appeared in the Wall Street Journal suggesting that the American connection was important and much of the detail may never have emerged in the UK but for this. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Through friends, Sorrell has maintained that he was always scrupulous in the separation of personal and business expenses. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That may be, but the scale of his personal expenses – £453,000 in 2014 – on top of his outsize salary must be considered outlandish.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a long career where he dominated the organisation it will come as no surprise that Sorrell was not as universally loved inside as he was by some of his sycophantic followers outside. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When he fell from grace there were no shortage of witnesses willing to testify to bullying and an extravagant expenses-fuelled lifestyle. </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Much of this may amount to tittle-tattle. But there was only one way to properly clear the air and allow Sorrell to get on with his life and WPP to restore some normality. That was to publish the Wilmer-Hale report.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As Seligman will know from her Washington life, the ‘cover up’ often proves more toxic than the underlying problem.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Engine trouble</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rolls-Royce has had more than its fair share of turmoil in recent times. But investors thought they could at least count on engineering excellence as bribery and bureaucracy were tackled. Even that, however, is starting to look a little ropy. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having been required to acknowledge a problem with the compressor on its Trent 1000 C package engine, which powers the Dreamliner, it has now discovered a similar problem in another group of engines requiring a one-off inspection.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The need to do more inspections, replace some compressors, fly closer to airports and other precautionary measures are a costly embarrassment. Worse if it were to hand advantage to US rivals General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In spite of the distraction, chief executive Warren East is sensibly getting on with his task of eliminating duplicate middle management jobs with 4,000 set to go. That too will be costly and disruptive. But it is necessary if the UK’s premier engineering group is to maintain a competitive edge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>US retreat</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Poundworld may be at the opposite end of the market to House of Fraser. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the reasons behind the decision of its American private equity owners to pull the plug are much the same. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Weak footfall, rising wage costs and surging business rates. Additional stress comes from higher import costs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But one cannot think that richly-resourced TPG – a value destroyer at Debenhams – pulled the rug too easily.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Annual meetings rarely live up to their promise.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Not far from the small Scottish village of Tyndrum, where Robert the Bruce suffered a rare defeat at the hands of the Clan MacDougall back in 1306, a new industry is emerging from the very hills themselves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://investing.thisismoney.co.uk/quote/SGZ">Scotgold Resources</a>  has just secured funding to build a small underground gold mine at Cononish, just a few short miles from Tyndrum, on a site that previously witnessed some small-scale production in the late 1980s.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And in terms of the global gold mining industry, the new production will be relatively small scale too, at around 30,000 ounces.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But that is actually ideal for this nascent industry, that will nevertheless bring employment and investment into an area that has suffered significant economic hardship in recent years. </p><img id="i-d1a86093805392a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/16/05E0DB58000005DC-5830821-image-a-37_1528730607099.jpg" height="407" width="634" alt="Scotgold Resources has secured funding to build a small underground gold mine at Cononish, just a few short miles from Tyndrum" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The project is in a National Park, and it took some debate before the go-ahead was granted. One of the conditions is that the industrial footprint is kept to a minimum.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But this is relatively easy, since Scotgold will be boring into the rock and mining underground, rather than digging a huge open pit typical of the world’s larger gold mining operations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What’s more, Scottish gold is known to command a premium over other types of gold, so it wouldn’t do to produce too much of it. Scotgold plans to sell around 30,000 ounces a year into this premium, a relatively small amount in global terms, where a large mine can produce upwards of a million ounces a year.</p><div>

</div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">To be sure, existing investors have had to wait a while for this outcome, as the company has sought permission to mine from the Parks authority and faced some opposition from mainly urban day-trippers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But those obstacles are all now cleared. Shares in the company soared in morning trade on Friday 18 May after the company announced that it had secured the final tranche of the funding required to put the Cononish gold mine in Scotland into production.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It’s very good news,’ says Richard Gray, the company’s chief executive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I come from an operational background, and I joined Scotgold with a view to getting things up and running. This new funding means we can now focus on the road ahead.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new money comes in a familiar form: a standard split between equity and debt. The equity component comes from a £4million oversubscribed placing of shares issued not at a discount, but at the mid-market price on 17 May. That’s a big tick in the box, and speaks of the attractions of Cononish to private equity and high net worths.</p><img id="i-50d4292c46bc8454" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/16/00E1C1BC000004B0-5830821-image-a-34_1528730528642.jpg" height="419" width="634" alt="The project is in the Trossach National Park and it took some debate before it could go-ahead" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The debt comes in the form of a secured loan facility with Nat le Roux, Scotgold’s chairman and largest shareholder. He has consistently backed the company ever since he became involved, and his support has allowed Scotgold to negotiate a tough financing environment in which Cononish has been deemed too small for major institutions to be interested in, but too big to go it completely alone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There will now be a short period of tying up loose bureaucratic ends before Scotgold gets onto the ground and begins construction.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We need to complete our legal agreements with the Parks Authority,’ says Gray. ‘We are applying for an employment agreement and we need to submit detailed design work.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But once the development timetable proper kicks in there will be a three-month period to allow for the sourcing of suppliers and to finalise contracts, and then construction will begin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first item on the agenda will be a widening of the existing underground access tunnel. Thereafter Scotgold will work progressively on developing the first ramp and installing the ventilation systems before moving on to first stoping.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While that’s all going on, the new plant will be coming in, and installation will get underway.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All told, says Gray, it should take the company just under a year to get into production. During the first phase of production Scotgold expects to process around 3,000 tonnes of ore per month. The cash generated from that mining activity will then be fed back into the project and allow for an expansion to 6,000 tonnes per month.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">All told, according to a feasibility study produced last year, Cononish is likely to generate between £67million and £100million in earnings over the life of the mine. The pre-tax net present value was put at £43million, using a 10 per cent discount rate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those numbers were predicated on a $1,150 gold price, or around £920 per gram so there’s still plenty of room for manoeuvre in spite of gold’s recent decline against the dollar.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We have a very low cost per ounce of production,’ says Gray.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One reason for that is the high grades at Cononish. The resource may be small at just over 600,000 tonnes of ore, but with the gold running at 11.1 grams per tonne gold, it’s likely to be highly profitable to mine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s also the premium for Scottish gold to consider. That’s hard to quantify, but Gray is convinced it will be beneficial.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Whatever the spot price is I’m convinced we’ll achieve a premium from this gold,’ he says. There’s still some work to be done yet, though. ‘The job isn’t done when the money’s raised,’ continues Gray. ‘The job’s done when the gold’s coming out of the ground.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what has he got planned between now and then to keep investor interested focused firmly on the company during what’s likely to be a period of relatively sparse newsflow? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We’ll be looking at our Grampian projects and exploration,’ he says. ‘The money that we raised is more than we need just for Cononish. It would be wonderful if we could identify another project the size of the Dalradian one.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Dalradian project, across the Irish sea but on the same geological trend, is the largest gold mining project in the British Isles. And if that seems a tad ambitious, in due course there will also be exploration in and around Cononish.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the moment the mine life there is set at ten years. But with a bit of work it could conceivably go higher.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Once we’re a couple of years into it I can see Cononish having its own little exploration programme,’ says Gray.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Scotgold Resources has just secured funding to build a small underground gold mine at Cononish, just a few short miles from Tyndrum, on a site that previously witnessed some small-scale production in the late 1980s.

Depending on your age, that could mean a fixed rate for decades – potentially 30 years or more.  </p><div>

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Because these rates are being fixed for such a long time, the rates on offer with a lifetime mortgage are much less sensitive to short-term movements, such as a base rate change by the Bank of England. Instead, they very much depend on a long-term view of rates and the economy more generally. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, that means taking into account times when interest rates could be high and other times when they are low. Many customers taking out a lifetime mortgage now will remember the double-digit interest rates of the 70s, 80s and 90s, but will also be aware of the exceptionally low interest rates that we have seen over the last decade or so.</p><img id="i-bb33f9dddcb39e92" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/11/4CF8967D00000578-5740075-image-a-2_1528282462844.jpg" height="373" width="306" alt="Steve Ellis, chief executive, Legal &amp; General Home Finance" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">That said, we should expect to see a greater correlation between long-term market interest rates and lifetime mortgage rates offered to customers. So, is now a good time to take a lifetime mortgage? Or should I wait?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would be a false economy to borrow money now that you might need in the future just because you think interest rates could rise – they may not, after all. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, if you have to borrow now, why wait? The best lifetime mortgage interest rates currently on offer are just about as low as they have been, with many providers offering fixed rates for life at below four per cent. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In any case, if you’re considering taking out a lifetime mortgage you should first <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/money/investing/article-1686664/Find-adviser.html">speak with a financial adviser</a> to get a better understanding of all the options open to you for retirement. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An adviser can help you to plan exactly how much you need to borrow now and whether you might need to have a drawdown facility should you need to borrow more in the future to help you achieve your retirement goals, or if you’re planning home renovations or perhaps want to gift money to your family later on. </p><img id="i-4b876e1891d888f9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/25/12/4B8AC48600000578-0-image-a-11_1524657354693.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="An increasing number of older homeowners are choosing to unlock equity from their homes " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">No one can predict what interest rates will be in the future, not even the Chancellor. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What we do know is that lifetime mortgage rates are currently at some of the lowest levels we’ve seen and, as a result, an increasing number of older homeowners are choosing to unlock equity from their homes to get the most out of retirement. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The simple answer, really, is to do what is right for you - it should ultimately depend on your needs in retirement – and always get professional advice.</p><div class="mol-html" id="mol-6d2d1d50-4a37-11e8-8700-29576a30451d">                            <div><iframe width="100%" height="300" style="background-color:transparent; display:block; padding: 0; max-width: 700px;" src="//embeds.audioboom.com/posts/6831356-should-people-cash-in-on-their-homes-to-enjoy-life-or-help-their-kids/embed/v4?eid=AQAAADxK41r8PGgA" title="Audioboom player"></iframe></div>                        </div><div class="moduleFull"><div class="item tim/tim_calc_home_equity_wrapper">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The price of filling up the car with petrol soared by more than £3 last month – meaning motorists must be more vigilant than ever about fuel consumption.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The cost of both petrol and diesel rose by an average of 6p a litre in May, according to the RAC. This has been blamed on US sanctions against the major oil producer Iran as well as the pound being weaker against the dollar, which is the currency used for trading in oil.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The average cost of filling a family car up with petrol is now £71 while for diesel it has risen to £73 – costing £1.29 a litre for petrol and £1.32 for diesel. Here, we show how you can save at least £6 every time you fill up – or even pay just £1 for your fuel by investing in a new vehicle.</p><img id="i-1a7e00f899b6759e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/13/4D13682600000578-5824301-The_average_cost_of_filling_a_family_car_up_with_petrol_is_now_7-m-12_1528546412142.jpg" height="540" width="634" alt="The average cost of filling a family car up with petrol is now £71 while for diesel it has risen to £73 – costing £1.29 a litre for petrol and £1.32 for diesel" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong></p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Compare pump prices and save £6 </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The recent price hike is painful but by visiting a different petrol pump you can end up paying less money than you were before.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Websites and phone apps can provide comparison services to find the best fuel prices in your area – with costs often varying by 10p a litre or more. Those worth considering include PetrolPrices, SimpleMotoring and Confused.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Supermarkets tend to offer among the best rates as they hope that by coming to pay for cheaper petrol, as low as £1.14 a litre, you may be lured into the store. Motorway service stations are among the most expensive, as high as £1.45 a litre, as they have a captive audience.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Josh Elliott, of PetrolPrices, says: ‘The trick is to prepare before embarking on a long journey – so you need not stop at an expensive service station when low on petrol.’ </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-e9d791c0-6c81-11e8-879f-6998b177b235">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">I’m £4,000 a year better off thanks to a Tesla (but it did cost £65,000)</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><img id="i-824059c3c889ae67" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/13/4D13680900000578-5824301-image-a-1_1528546000224.jpg" height="391" width="586" alt="Thom Monk says he saves £4,000 a year on fuel bills thanks to his electric vehicle " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thom Monk believes he now saves £4,000 a year on fuel bills thanks to trading in his old gas-guzzler for an electric vehicle three years ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 40-year-old paid £65,000 for an electric Tesla Model S car after getting tired of filling up an ageing Volkswagen Touran with £80 of diesel at least twice a week. The commercial manager from Bristol uses the car for a 200-mile round trip commute to Slough in Berkshire two or three times a week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thom says: ‘When you are buying a new car, spending an extra £10,000 or so on an electric vehicle seems to me like a no-brainer – you can recoup the extra cost in just over a couple of years. Being able to avoid the headache of always having to fill up at petrol stations is also a godsend.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He adds: ‘Forget those tired old jokes about electric cars being a bit like milk floats. My Tesla can do nought to 60 miles per hour in just over four seconds – faster than most traditional sports cars.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thom plugs the vehicle into his home electricity supply every night to repower it. The father of two has a couple of solar panels at home that help recharge the battery. He uses renewable energy provider Pure Planet to save money on energy bills – paying £1,000 a year on electricity for his three-bedroom home. This is £400 less than he paid after switching provider last year. The bill includes the few pounds a week for recharging. </p></div>                        </div><img id="i-c624d16f6e9d4634" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/13/4D14008D00000578-5824301-image-a-10_1528546373780.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Slow down: Driving at 80mph uses up to 25 per cent more fuel than motoring at 70mph" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong></p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Drive cautiously and pocket an extra £15 </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Motorists who enjoy the thrill of putting their foot down on the accelerator may feel less excited about the experience when they next visit the petrol pump. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Research by reviewer WhatCar? has found driving at 80mph uses up to 25 per cent more fuel than motoring at 70mph. Dramatic acceleration and sudden braking will make the car even thirstier as will not changing gear until the motor is revved up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Josh Elliott says: ‘You would be amazed how much money you can save by being a better driver. If your car has a cruise control option it is a good idea to use this as it will save you a fortune in fuel.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having calmed your inner Stirling Moss or Lewis Hamilton, there are other measures you should consider taking to be less of a gas-guzzler.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Using the air conditioning can add 10 per cent on to your fuel bill and is especially draining on the engine when you are stuck in a traffic jam. You should also check your tyres are fully inflated – to make for safer as well as more economic driving.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have a roof rack on the car this adds wind resistance that can also affect fuel efficiency by as much as 10 per cent. Even cleaning out the car and not filling up the tank completely with petrol can have an impact as the extra weight burns more fuel. </p><div>

These include the £8,750 Suzuki Celerio, which can offer you as much as 78 miles per gallon. But if you plan on taking the entire family on a long trip you might need to drive a bigger vehicle. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the family a £15,000 Peugeot 308 can manage 47 miles per gallon while if you want lots of space in the boot an estate such as the £15,750 Skoda Octavia might manage 42 miles per gallon.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those who have their heart set on something that sits high on the road might opt for a sports utility vehicle such as the £19,000 Peugeot 3008, which should provide you with 40 miles per gallon. </p><img id="i-44e7d0b41378b5fa" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/13/4D14008900000578-5824301-image-a-11_1528546382788.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Supermarkets tend to offer the best rates for petrol as they hope to lure you into the shop" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong></p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Choose and electric car and save £64 </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Welcome to the future’ was a term coined when the one-seater electric ‘velomobile’ Sinclair C5 was launched with a fanfare in 1985 – and bombed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet more than three decades later, it really could finally be happening thanks to technology and the rising cost of driving a traditional car. The Government has also said it is banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars in Britain from 2040.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The downside is that electric vehicles are still more expensive than a petrol-driven car and need recharging every 100 miles or so – using an electric point that is rarely found in a public car park – and need an adapted power point at your home. An eight-hour overnight charge can cost £10.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Among the best value electric cars is the £25,000 Nissan Leaf, the £32,000 Volkswagen e-Golf and the £33,000 BMW i3. There is also a Government ‘plug-in car grant’ that allows you to get £4,500 off the list price. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An electric car escapes road tax – unless it is a ‘luxury’ model, such as a Tesla, costing more than £40,000. For these vehicles you pay £310 a year for five years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A compromise is the hybrid that allows you to put your foot down with traditional fuel when on a motorway but switch to electric when stuck in town. According to car reviewer Auto Express, the £23,000 Toyota Prius, the £20,500 Hyundai Ioniq and the £36,000 Volvo XC60 are among the best. These hybrid vehicles qualify for a less generous ‘plug-in’ grant of up to £2,500.

Fees apply for advice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tom, who lives in the South West, held £450,000 in cash during the financial crisis. These £50 ‘Houblon’ notes bore the image of Sir John Houblon, who was the first Governor of the Bank of England in 1694.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 73-year-old former finance officer says: ‘Near retirement and fearful after the Northern Rock disaster, we put savings into Houblons. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">HSBC, which also held my will as an executor, advised keeping the notes sealed to ease re-depositing at a later date.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘However, in February 2013 we were stopped from doing so by a manager who wrongly said the notes were shortly to be withdrawn from circulation.’</p><img id="i-80953a7b6f9d763b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/12/4D13E7E300000578-5824271-image-a-30_1528545103903.jpg" height="204" width="634" alt="Even if banks do act correctly, limitations in advice may be detrimental to customers" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Houblons did not cease to be legal tender until the end of April 2014 – a year later – when they were replaced by notes already in use, bearing the faces of industrialists Matthew Boulton and James Watts. Tom adds: ‘Our cash was essentially frozen by HSBC on a false premise and we could not deposit or invest elsewhere for more than a year.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eventually, in 2014 the couple were allowed by a different manager to re-deposit their cash, but they say it was too late and they missed their investment opportunity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During this time the bank also lost Tom’s will. He says it has been ‘four traumatic years’ trying to make bank staff and the Ombudsman understand his complaint, and says the handling of his case has been of a ‘deplorably low standard’. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An HSBC spokeswoman says: ‘The customer’s complaint dates back to 2008 when he decided to hold cash during the financial crisis. In 2013, when he came to trade in his cash, the notes were no longer in service.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Tom points out this was incorrect as Houblons were not withdrawn until the end of April 2014 – a date that is confirmed on the Bank of England’s website. HSBC had suggested Tom went to the trouble of booking appointments at larger branches to deposit his cash in tranches, which he refused. After further discussions he was permitted to put the entire sum back into the bank in 2014.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Commenting on the lost will, a spokesman says: ‘We have apologised for losing his will, and for the distress and inconvenience this caused, and have offered to pay for a replacement.’</p><img id="i-97650a6ab3c2c9d1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/12/12D98C2800000514-5824271-image-a-31_1528545113922.jpg" height="413" width="634" alt="The bank denied one man investment advice on account of his wife¿s health problems" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Bank denied me advice after 72 years as a customer</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">A second Premier customer says he feels ‘abandoned’ by the bank after it denied him advice about his investments on account of his wife’s health problems.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 83-year-old, who does not wish to be named, has been a customer for 72 years – having first opened an account aged 11 when it was known as Midland Bank.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But recently he was told financial advice is not available to clients if they or their partner need long-term care. His wife has Parkinson’s disease and dementia but her care is fully funded.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also holds power of attorney and can therefore make financial decisions on her behalf, though it is a grey area about what decisions can be made about someone else’s investments. He says: ‘I have been a loyal client for 72 years and just when I need their help most at my age, they abandon me.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He believes the decision is a ‘disgrace’ and that the bank is paid for a service it is not performing – leaving him unsure about whether to stick with or sell investments.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">HSBC referred the customer to the Society of Later Life Advisers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An HSBC spokeswoman says: ‘We understand that when a customer or family member enters care it is always a difficult time. Given the complexity of advice needed we refer them to specialist, accredited advisers who have the technical expertise in this area and can ensure the best outcome for them.’<strong> </strong></p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">But is it even worth taking bank advice? </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even if banks follow their rules carefully, limitations in their advice may be detrimental to customers. Rachel Sartin works for adviser Chase de Vere and is a chartered financial planner – the highest badge of honour among advisers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She says helping clients who have previously received incomplete, sales-focused advice from their bank is commonplace, adding: ‘Some bank advisers focus too much on selling products, especially their own, or can only give advice on a limited range of products.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sartin recently had a meeting with a female GP who was disappointed by a ‘restricted adviser’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These professionals can only make recommendations about specific products or from a limited range of products.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sartin’s client was not able to get advice about her pension because the adviser could only discuss pensions from a set list, which did not include her own. The client’s Isa investments were not part of the company’s range either so the adviser, unable to deliver advice on those accounts, tried to sell the GP new ones.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sartin says: ‘The GP wanted to invest ethically but this was never discussed with the adviser who was more focused on selling their own firm’s products.’</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-7add9e20-6c83-11e8-879f-6998b177b235">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">What you need to know about types of financial advice </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"> These are the different types of financial advice available:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1. INDEPENDENT</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ‘gold’ standard of advice comes from independent financial advisers, who consider all options across the whole of the market. They can assess your needs holistically, spotting how one individual concern might impact another, for example the tax implications of a particular investment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. RESTRICTED</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Usually found at banks as well as standalone firms. Some are restricted by their area of specialism, such as pensions or investments, but can still recommend any product from across the whole of the market. Others are restricted by what products they can recommend or sell. In some cases restricted advisers are limited in both ways – by specialism and product range.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. GUIDANCE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A computer algorithm can help customers decide their next steps and is often called a ‘robo-adviser’. These are no substitute for recommendations from a fully regulated and qualified human being, but it is a cheaper and simpler route for people with basic financial needs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Increasingly it is being adopted by online companies – such as Nutmeg, Moneyfarm and Moneybox – to help customers identify a suitable investment portfolio, which is then managed on their behalf. However, experts say unless a human is behind it offering regulated advice, it is not advice at all – instead it is ‘guidance’. </p></div></div><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The high street’s biggest banks field the most complaints about investments generally, according to figures from the Financial Ombudsman Service, which mediates in fallouts between consumers and financial companies.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Thousands of school and university students slaving over summer exams are being carried through the pain barrier by gap year plans to travel the world once the hard work is over.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Growing numbers of older, professional workers are also satisfying their wanderlust by putting careers on hold for a year out of the rat race. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But experts are warning all travellers to plan ahead to cover often overlooked essential costs, such as vaccinations, travel visas and insurance.</p><img id="i-efc5386e3e122377" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/14/4D1369ED00000578-5824375-image-a-44_1528549658442.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Mapping out the future: Jamie Ody hopes to visit Peru, pictured, Belize and Brazil on his trip" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>VACCINATIONS AND VISAS </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One in five travellers do not bother to check what vaccinations they need for trips abroad, according to website Travel Insurance Explained. Spokeswoman Fiona Macrae says although the cost of getting jabs can put people off (charges can be £50 for each of the most common vaccinations for gap year travel, such as yellow fever, rabies and hepatitis B), it is not a risk worth taking.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Macrae says: ‘Backpackers can check the National Travel Health Network Centre website (nathnac.net) for any vaccinations that are needed. This should be done whether they are visiting a country for a few days or months.’</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">She adds that all travellers should understand what visas are required for their chosen destinations: ‘The entry requirements, visas and how long people can stay or work, differ from country to country. Some countries may ask for proof that travellers have been immunised against certain viruses or diseases before they are allowed to enter.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Check visa information and travel advice for all countries on the Foreign Office website. Although many visas are issued electronically within days, some can take weeks so allow plenty of time to make the application. Steer clear of unofficial visa websites which may add extra administration charges for their service – unnecessary if you go through official government channels.</p><img id="i-4a04bcb54e1302cd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/14/4D1369AB00000578-5824375-image-a-45_1528549709602.jpg" height="479" width="634" alt="Budget: Swati Karia, 31, from North West London who is now in Vietnam, saved for nine months" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jamie Ody will finish his A-level exams this week and plans to take on bar and college jobs immediately in his home town of Cambridge. The 18-year-old has his sights set on a South America trip early next year visiting Belize, Brazil and Peru, so is keen to save as much as possible in advance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As well as budgeting for the flights, accommodation and various activities he and his friends plan to do on their travels, such as trekking, Jamie will also set aside cash for vaccinations and travel insurance. He will not require visas for the countries he is visiting. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I’ll need yellow fever, rabies and hepatitis jabs for South America so that will cost me about £150 in total,’ says Jamie, who hopes to go to university to read history in September 2019. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It is not a big cost in relation to the total price tag of the trip – which will be about £5,000 – but I know it is important not to forget to get the jabs. I’ve also bought specialist travel insurance which cost £250.’</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-ca098590-6be3-11e8-8349-8db1180105b2">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Laura’s ‘crazy’ year of travelling (and all with a full-time job) </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><img id="i-7c7a2f03a099c253" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/14/4D13692500000578-5824375-image-a-47_1528549731458.jpg" height="381" width="284" alt="Laura Rettie has clocked up eight countries and has ten more trips planned" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In January Laura Rettie, 35, set herself the challenge of visiting as many countries as she could in a year – fitting it around her full-time job and only using permitted annual leave – a total of 29 days.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It feels like a gap year of sorts,’ says Laura, who lives in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, and works for comparison website money.co.uk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She says: ‘Travel has been my major focus this year. Saving, budgeting and planning my numerous trips.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Laura has already clocked up eight countries, including Australia, Dubai, Finland, Greece, Japan and Norway and has a further ten trips booked in before the end of the year – which will take in Austria, Denmark, Hungary, Russia and Sweden.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With the European stays, Laura squeezes the trip into a weekend – flying out after work late on a Friday and returning on Sunday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Laura says: ‘My motivation for this crazy year came after I visited my brother Bryn in Amsterdam, where he recently moved for work.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I met a group of his colleagues – all much younger than me – who were so well travelled. I thought I’m in my mid-30s and I’ve barely seen the world. This challenge is about pushing myself – as I usually travel alone – and broadening my experiences.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘So far it has been amazing. I wanted to prove you can travel extensively while still working full time.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To protect her travels, Laura bought a worldwide annual multi-trip policy from InsureandGo for £33. Her travel costs for the year have come in at around £6,000. She has used a mixture of income and savings but also took out a Post Office credit card, which offers zero per cent interest on purchases for three years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Laura says: ‘The card means I will be able to pay off the balance within the next few years without incurring interest. It has been a great way to spread the costs.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The added bonus of the card is there are no foreign transaction fees for usage abroad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I have saved a fortune by using this card when I am away,’ says Laura. ‘I rarely carry currency – particularly on the shorter trips – because it costs such a lot to exchange small amounts of money. Many countries prefer card transactions too, so this is a good one to have in your wallet.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>INSURANCE </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A worrying number of ‘gappers’ – young and old – embark without travel insurance. Research by student insurer Endsleigh found that 48 per cent of 15 to 24-year-olds travel without cover each year, with one in four young people wrongly believing the UK Government will cover their medical expenses if something goes wrong overseas.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is particularly alarming given the potential cost of treatment while travelling. Medical claims where someone has been hospitalised in the United States, for example, can run into hundreds of thousands of pounds – and repatriation many thousands more.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Georgie Frost, spokeswoman for insurance comparison website GoCompare, says: ‘Do not let the adventure of your gap year turn into a nightmare. Opt for a specialist gap year policy and make sure you are properly covered.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cost is often a challenge for young people looking for travel insurance but it is important not to cut corners to save money. It may be that you have to pay more than £200 for the right cover, but this is necessary for peace of mind.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Policy terms and the amount of excess – the first part of any claim which you must contribute – varies from policy to policy, so it is important to read the details and check you have the right cover for your needs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Frost adds: ‘Make sure you do not do anything which could potentially invalidate your cover, such as high-risk activities like bungee-jumping or white-water rafting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘You can get backpacker policies which will cover this sort of pursuit, but do not assume you are covered in all eventualities until you have read your documentation.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Swati Karia, 31, from North West London, knew she wanted to take part in activities such as kayaking, snorkelling and ziplining during her gap year in Asia so she sought a policy which would encompass them all. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Swati, who left the UK in April, has already visited India, Thailand and the Philippines and is now in Vietnam.

But this could be a costly mistake.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rachel Springall, money expert at financial data collector Moneyfacts, warns: ‘While in contrast to carrying cash, consumers get protection from theft when using plastic abroad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Some debit and credit cards charge exorbitant fees each time you spend or withdraw cash. A debit card with a high street bank could charge around £11 for a £250 cash withdrawal overseas. A credit card could charge a fee of almost £15 on the same withdrawal.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Springall points out there are more cost-effective cards – provided you pass the lender’s credit checks. She says credit cards from Creation Financial Services, Halifax and Santander have no fees for purchases or cash withdrawals overseas (although interest is charged on transactions). Aqua, Post Office and Tandem also offer good deals for overseas use.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nationwide’s FlexPlus debit card allows free withdrawals worldwide and Metro Bank’s debit card is free to use to take out cash in Europe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Travellers hoping to budget their expenses could choose a prepaid card. This works like a bank account in that you can only spend what is loaded on to the card – but you cannot go overdrawn. If the card is lost, it can be replaced without any loss of money. There are prepaid cards that do not charge for ATM cash withdrawals, such as the Ice Travellers Cashcard. Other good prepaid cards for overseas use include Lyk, WeSwap, FairFX and the EasyFX One. </p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Swati, who was working as a consultant in a bank before her trip, stuck to a strict budget for nine months before setting off on her travels. ‘I did some extreme budgeting to save up for my gap year,’ she says. ‘I cut out all non-essential spending and luxuries – eating out, gym membership, holidays – and looked to make savings wherever possible, comparing and switching household bills and taking great care over food shopping.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Comparison websites are useful for trawling the market for the most suitable travel cover at the best price. But ensure a policy is bought before leaving the UK as it is not easy to get insurance once you are overseas. Even if you can, choice of insurer is limited and premiums high.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">For policies bought before you go, consider Explorer Travel Insurance, which has a backpacker policy at £161. This is the price for an 18-year-old needing cover for a 12-month worldwide trip.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> It covers around 50 sports and activities including bungee-jumping (within strict limits), scuba diving and jet skiing. The policy offers £5 million for emergency medical expenses with a £125 excess. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is £750 for lost or stolen baggage (with a limit of £100 per item) with a £150 excess. In addition policyholders have £1,000 for cancellation (£125 excess) and there is also cover for losses incurred due to an airline going bust. Generally, gap year travellers planning to volunteer or work while they are abroad should tread carefully. Few insurers, even specialist backpacking insurers will cover all types of work.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is because it is difficult to price the risk as there are varying standards of workplace health and safety in different countries.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-77243fe0-6be4-11e8-8349-8db1180105b2">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Four routes to living generously </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>PROJECT TRUST</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Various volunteering schemes in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Electric cars used to be considered faddish and unreliable. To many traditionalists, they still are.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having proved that lithium is there, Archer now has to determine if the economics stack up – can the company move to commercial production and become a profitable business? A scoping study marks the first step in this process and is expected to be published in the next couple of weeks. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most Savannah followers expect a positive result and the shares should respond, if they are right.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Archer then moves to a more detailed feasibility study and, if that also suggests the mine is viable, the group can move towards production in 2020. Mines require funding, obviously, and Savannah will need at least £60 million and possibly up to £110 million to construct the necessary infrastructure.</p><img id="i-a6f5a1df8775df1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/17/4D149D7600000578-5824713-image-a-152_1528560513539.jpg" height="416" width="634" alt="Most people associate Spain and Portugal with sun, sea and siestas, particularly now" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fortunately, lenders seem relatively keen to fund lithium projects, as demand for the metal is expected to outstrip supply over the next few years. Car makers will clearly need lithium but demand is expected to come from the battery storage market too, as companies develop massive batteries capable of storing electricity until it is needed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Savannah may well seek out deals with carmakers and other businesses to highlight its creditworthiness to banks and gain access to reasonably priced debt funding. There may even be equity deals with customers who would be given shares in the company in return for cash.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mines can take years to move into production but the Savannah site in Portugal should deliver considerably faster than most, not least because the area is well supplied with roads, power and a deep water port in Porto. Savannah also has a full mining lease so it does not need to wait for government permits or approvals and it has applied for nine further exploration licences.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Archer has two further strings to his bow – a copper mine in Oman and a mineral sands joint venture with mining giant Rio Tinto in Mozambique. The copper mine has been held up by licensing delays but it could prove rewarding in the future.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The partnership in Mozambique is at an early stage but Rio Tinto does not usually join forces with junior mining firms so the venture is, at the very least, an endorsement of Savannah’s credentials.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Archer, a qualified Australian barrister, has worked in the mining industry for more than 30 years. He has a track record of success and a wide network of contacts, that should serve Savannah well over the next few years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Midas verdict: </strong>As an early-stage mining company, Savannah is not a stock for the risk averse. But it could be a useful addition to a balanced portfolio. If all goes according to plan, the shares, at 8¼p, should prove rewarding and there are likely to be several positive updates in the coming months. A buy for the adventurous investor.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-33ce4780-6c8f-11e8-aae9-398a155255c7">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">What next for bitcoin? </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">After last year’s mania when Bitcoin's price spiked to almost $20,000, the cryptocurrency took a tumble and interest has drained away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now Bitcoin Google searches are down 90%.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Is that it for cryptocurrency, or is it time to buy for the long-term when things are quiet?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On this podcast we take a look at who’s buying, holding and waiting for the price to rise again.</p><div class="mol-html" id="mol-33cebcb0-6c8f-11e8-aae9-398a155255c7">                            <div><iframe width="100%" height="300" style="background-color:transparent; display:block; padding: 0; max-width: 700px;" src="//embeds.audioboom.com/posts/6889654-whatever-happened-to-bitcoin/embed/v4?eid=AQAAAOmvGlu2IGkA" title="Audioboom player"></iframe></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> Press play to listen to the show above, or listen (and please subscribe if you like the podcast) at <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/this-is-money-show/id979600898?mt=2">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.acast.com/thisismoneyshow">Acast</a> and <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://audioboom.com/channel/thisismoney">Audioboom</a> or visit our <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/podcast/index.html">This is Money Podcast page</a>.    </p>                            </div>                        </div><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>In 2017, there were around 125,000 electric vehicles on the road in Europe.

However, Asda staff have so far only been offered £8.50 on new contracts introduced last year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It emerged on Friday that chief executive Mike Coupe received £3.4 million last year, a 45 per cent increase on the previous 12 months. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The big jump in his pay followed a gaffe on the day the plan to merge the two firms was announced, when he was filmed singing We’re In The Money from the musical 42nd Street. He later apologised.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Retail sources said many Asda staff have yet to be moved on to the new contracts and are still being paid £7.83, the minimum wage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">GMB national officer Gary Carter, who represents as many as half of the company’s employees, said: ‘Asda staff are well aware that Sainsbury’s employees are earning more, whether that is under the existing contracts or the new flexible contracts. They will be looking for the company to adopt best practice and for wages to increase.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Carter said the union has raised concerns over the potential impact of the proposed merger on staff and plans further talks to address the pay gap. ‘This is very affordable. Both of these businesses are very profitable. If you want thriving local economies and good communities, you need to pay decent wages,’ he said.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The merged group’s annual profit is expected to be above £1 billion. He added that there were concerns among staff about the merger and ‘staff believe they should get something out of it too.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Retail market sources estimated that increasing pay at Asda would cost at least £100 million. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is understood that Asda staff also receive lower pension contributions than their Sainsbury’s counterparts and fewer holidays. Sainsbury’s new contracts mean many staff will get a pay rise, with London-based employees receiving £9.80 an hour. But it has also come under fire because an estimated 9,000 longer-serving staff will be left worse off under the new deal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The plan to combine the two firms has raised fears that jobs could be lost and suppliers may see prices cut. Sainsbury’s and Asda insisted there are no plans to close stores. However, they may be forced to sell stores under a competition probe launched last month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman for Asda said: ‘In the event of the proposed merger, Asda and Sainsbury’s contracts will remain separate and distinct, just as the businesses will. We will always have any discussions about our colleagues’ pay with them first.’</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The two grocers have announced plans to combine to create a £51 billion giant with 2,800 stores and 330,000 employees.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">A delicious aroma of speculation is wafting across the Atlantic over whether Howard Schultz, the retiring chairman of Starbucks, will take on Donald Trump in a run for the US Presidency.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When we hear the word Starbucks in this country, we tend to think of how the purveyor of bucket-sized lattes got itself embroiled in a row over tax avoidance in 2012 – but Schultz, its 64-year-old founder, would make a fascinating anti-Trump candidate in 2020.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Schultz view of the US economy, expressed both through his words and the way he has built his business, could not be more different from the tenets of Trumponomics. Where Trump is protectionist, nationalist and narrowly focused, Schultz is a liberal globalist who says he wants to serve up unity, compassion and love along with the flat whites. (I know. He seems to mean it, though.)</p><img id="i-6ed3a6ee09c1b52c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/16/4D14981E00000578-5824631-Howard_Schultz_the_retiring_chairman_of_Starbucks-a-105_1528558543697.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="Howard Schultz, the retiring chairman of Starbucks would make a fascinating anti-Trump candidate in 2020" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">While Trump looks to wage a trade war with China, Schultz is opening stores there at a rate of one every 15 hours. Where the President wants to build walls, the Starbucks boss declares he wants to build bridges.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The idea of a leading businessman – or woman – running for Prime Minister in this country seems outlandish. The business ‘brand’ overall has been tarnished by executive greed and seemingly endless snafus in the vein of Carillion and TSB, so corporate bosses have scant appeal to the voters.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s rare for chief executives or chairmen to say anything remotely political for fear of upsetting someone, even when their bottom line could be at risk, let alone on principle or for the good of society.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They do things differently in America. A couple of years ago I spent several days at Starbucks’ HQ and went to the annual shareholder meeting at Seattle’s McCaw Hall, which was more like a rock concert than a typical stuffy British AGM, with dry, curling-up sandwiches and even drier speeches.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alicia Keys belted out several numbers to the packed crowd – so many people had turned up that tents with video links had to be erected to accommodate the overspill – but it was Schultz who was the real star. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To the accompaniment of melancholy music, he stood in front of a giant screen with the words ‘Have we lost our way, America’ displayed over images of conflict, homeless people, border control and a gigantic photograph of the then Presidential candidate Donald Trump.</p><img id="i-cc80898def2294c1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/16/4D14980A00000578-5824631-image-a-104_1528558489153.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="While Trump looks to wage a trade war with China, Schultz is opening stores there at a rate of one every 15 hours" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">To a standing ovation from his rapturous shareholders, Schultz told his audience how he himself has lived out the American Dream, rising from a poor upbringing in Brooklyn to be a corporate titan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He shared his fears of how that dream was dying a death and urged investors to reclaim it: ‘Not with despair, but with possibility. Not with division, but with unity. Not with exclusion, but with inclusion. Not with fear but with compassion. Not with indifference, but with love.’</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Again, hard to imagine that at the annual meeting of M&amp;S, but for good measure, he took out a two-page advertisement in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal preaching hope and optimism.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some of it sounds saccharine to British ears – when we hear claims that Starbucks is ‘not just selling coffee but creating communities’ it’s all a bit icky.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet in terms of a straight contest between businessmen, Schultz is already a hands-down winner. The Trump Organisation is a private company which has around 22,500 employees and turnover of $9.5 billion, whereas Starbucks is a huge worldwide empire with more than 350,000 staff, 28,000 outlets and revenues of $22.4 billion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump himself has established that an entrepreneur, rather than a professional politician, can be President, and Schultz is credible as a progressive answer to him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s an open question, though, whether the Starbucks man really wants to subject himself to the bruising that would come with a run for office. Arguably he has enjoyed more influence and more power to change the planet as the world’s top barista than he would in the White House, so why trade down? But The Howard versus The Donald: that’s a prospect to relish.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>When we hear the word Starbucks in this country, we tend to think of how the purveyor of bucket-sized lattes got itself embroiled in a row over tax avoidance in 2012 – but Schultz, its 64-year-old founder, would make a fascinating anti-Trump candidate in 2020.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>Financial Mail On Sunday</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Rebecca Goodman</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-10T09:01:36.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>RUTH SUNDERLAND: A flat white please, Mr President...</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-10T09:01:36.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/article-5823405/CITY-DIARY-Sacked-BT-boss-chiselled-face-corporate-failure.html" title="CITY DIARY: Sacked BT boss is the chiselled face of corporate failure "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/investing/article-5822485/Why-steer-clear-Russian-funds.html" title="Why you MUST steer clear of Russian funds: Experts warn its economy is unstable and too sensitive to oil prices"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-5822543/Henri-Lloyd-High-Street-shop-bust.html" title="Henri Lloyd is next High Street shop to go bust: Sailing fashion retailer has seven stores around the UK"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-5822467/MARKET-REPORT-firms-2-1bn-swoop-UK-satellite-maker-Inmarsat.html" title="MARKET REPORT: US billionaire Charlie Ergen's Echostar Corporation makes a £2.1bn swoop for UK satellite maker Inmarsat"></link></item><item><title>TONY HETHERINGTON: Scottish Power broke into our British Legion's flat over a previous tenant's unpaid bill and took 51 weeks to pay a £129 refund</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/experts/article-5824417/Why-taken-51-weeks-129-refund-Scottish-Power-TONY-HETHERINGTON-investigates.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jun 2018 22:01:05 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5824417</guid><description><![CDATA[You were told a cheque for £129 would be on its way to reimburse you for the cost of the new lock, but it never arrived.

You were told a cheque for £129 would be on its way to reimburse you for the cost of the new lock, but the cheque never arrived. Scottish Power said it would issue a new cheque but that failed to arrive as well, so you contacted me.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">When I stepped in you were immediately called by ScottishPower and told that the latest cheque must have arrived because it had been cashed in February. More weeks passed while ScottishPower checked with its bank and eventually admitted that your £129 had been sent to the new tenant. He assumed this was compensation for shutting him out of his home and he banked it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That brought us up to last month, when ScottishPower told me it would not be asking for its money back from the tenant and it had issued a fresh cheque to you. Except, unbelievably, the fresh cheque never arrived. I went back to the company and found it had never been posted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finally, last Tuesday, your Royal British Legion club got its cheque, plus £50 on top to make up for the inconvenience. As you told me: ‘It doesn’t seem a great deal of money, but for clubs such as ours, run mainly by volunteers and goodwill, every penny counts.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Quite right – but after 51 weeks of waiting, I still bet you wish you had been paid by the hour. </p><img id="i-a4445e6e35ab9b28" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/14/4D13690200000578-5824417-image-a-57_1528550564814.jpg" height="349" width="634" alt="Our room at the Hotel Hesperia in Playa Dorada in Tenerife was directly above a concert room where there was construction work" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><strong>Building work at hotel </strong><strong></strong><strong><strong><strong>ruined our £3,000 trip</strong></strong></strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>I.H. writes:</strong> <span class="mol-style-italic">After a year in which I suffered major health problems and my partner was recovering from breast cancer surgery, I decided we needed a peaceful holiday. I paid £3,000 to book a ‘deluxe’ trip with First Choice, part of the TUI Group.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">However, our room at the Hotel Hesperia in Playa Dorada in Tenerife was directly above a concert room where there was construction work, with a pneumatic drill hammering away, making it impossible to rest. TUI must have known, as other guests said they had been relocated to different parts of the hotel. Back home, I contacted TUI but heard nothing.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">I phoned and was asked to resubmit my complaint, which I did. I have even written to the managing director, but I am still waiting for a meaningful reply.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Building work at hotels has been a major source of holidaymakers’ complaints for years. Most travel companies warn customers ahead of travel and relocate them or offer a decent price cut.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">What went wrong here, TUI says, is that it had no advance warning. The company explained: ‘Unfortunately, our hotel partner only brought the building works to our attention once Mr H’s party was already in the resort.’ TUI would contact you to apologise and offer recompense, I was told.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So far, so good. But then things became weird. You told me TUI had not in fact been in touch and no recompense had been offered. When I queried this, TUI refused to go into details because it said you had complained to the Association of British Travel Agents. ‘We now need to respond via them,’ TUI told me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The picture painted by TUI was that it had to respect ABTA’s procedures. Yet a fortnight ago I reported the case of a different customer, injured on board a TUI cruise ship. In that case, the company refused to deal with ABTA and has challenged the injured pensioner to sue in court. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I told TUI this made no sense. Whether this made any difference, I do not know. But TUI suddenly contacted you and agreed to refund £1,000. You have said you are confident The Mail on Sunday’s involvement was the key to the refund.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You are probably right, but it is disheartening that TUI seems able to pick and choose which of ABTA’s complaints cases it will respect. </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-0b38d9e0-6be8-11e8-8349-8db1180105b2">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">We're watching you... </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">The boss of a London-based currency trading scam exposed by The Mail on Sunday three years ago has been jailed for six years in Dublin after British authorities took no action against him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jonathan Chubb, 38, was the sole director of WiseFX Europe Limited.

But I warned this was really a paid-for advert in the paper, dressed up to look like a news story. I also revealed that Chubb had a criminal record after pleading guilty to stealing £6,300. While working for a lettings agency he diverted tenants’ rents to his own bank account.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chubb has now pleaded guilty in Dublin to 34 counts of theft, four counts of deception, six charges of having a forged driving licence and one charge of money laundering. He admitted that he gave customers of WiseFX his bank details, supposedly for currency trading and stole about £18,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The court heard that Chubb had 12 previous convictions for fraud and theft. A report said he had a ‘difficult upbringing’ as his father Noel was absent. His father was serving a prison sentence for manslaughter. Chubb’s younger brother Gareth was cleared in Amsterdam last year of attempting to shoot a man in a drugs dispute, but was jailed for six months for possessing a loaded gun.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At an earlier hearing, Jonathan Chubb told the court that despite his criminal record, he was working as a salesman for Paymentsense, a London company in the credit card industry.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What did your parents teach you about money?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That it would not mean anything unless you were happy doing what you were doing. I grew up in Oslo and am from a middle-class Norwegian family. My father was a musician who died when I was six years old. My mother was a teacher but she did not push me towards education. She always said: ‘I do not care if you collect dustbins, but whatever you do, be happy.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She did not have a lot of money when I was growing up but we lived within our means and I did not want for anything.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What was the first paid work you ever did?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Picking berries and selling them at the roadside at the age of five or six. But the first meaningful job I had was working at a multi-media arts centre outside Oslo, when I was 16. It had a recording studio in the basement and great artists coming from abroad like David Hockney and Yoko Ono.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I got to meet them – I was one of the assistants running around, sorting out every little thing that needed to be done for their exhibitions. They gave me the odd kind word but what I found most exciting was peeking into their world. It made me realise one’s hobby could be a way of life. I found that quite informative and inspirational.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Have you ever struggled to make ends meet?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes. Guitarist Paul [Waaktaar-Savoy] and I first moved to London in 1982 and we quickly went through the money we had saved in Norway. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We were here on tourist visas and were not allowed to work. So I would do cash-in-hand jobs like working as a builder tearing down buildings with asbestos, and as a barman in pubs for £1 an hour. Sneaking over the border, trying to make sure you were not stopped, was always a big issue.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To save money, we would all sleep in one room with a little hotplate and a sink in the corner. There were lots of mice. I remember we caught some and put them in an aquarium as pets. In one place, there was a broken window in the bedroom, which we covered with black plastic. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was also a gas leak. Sometimes there were not enough beds, so we would take it in turns to sleep on bare bed-boards or mattresses on the floor.</p><img id="i-4900c90d522ba863" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/14/4D1368E500000578-5824429-One_of_Magne_Furuholmen_s_sculptures_which_can_go_for_20_000_eac-m-69_1528551323086.jpg" height="599" width="634" alt="One of Magne Furuholmen's sculptures which can go for £20,000 each" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How long did you struggle for?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Until we signed our first record deal in 1984. For two years, we lived in those bedsits. But looking back, it seems like some of the best times we had.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> We would spend most nights between 1am and 10am in the recording studio, because that was when the studio owner let us use it for free, and then sleep during the day. I was 21 and for me, it was an intense time of creative output. We managed to get by on very little. Lead singer Morten [Harket] would always dress up in outrageous make-up and get us into clubs like Camden Palace for free.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When we got there, we would steal drinks from other customers at the bar when they looked away. Other nights when we might be watching a film the meter would run out, and so we would sit in a dark room, waiting for the sun to come up. If we had told our families, they would have sent us money, but we did not want that – we wanted to make our own way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Have you ever been paid silly money per hour for a job?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I think once we reached the level of success we did, the money becomes kind of silly in itself. So I think it is healthy I lived through those difficult times beforehand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There have been a few corporate gigs over the years where I have divided the fee I was paid by the number of notes I played and realised it was silly money. The most I was paid was £2,000 a note for Take On Me during a short, well-paid corporate gig.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What was the best year of your life, in terms of the money you made?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have never thought about my life that way, but the last ten years have probably included my biggest earning years. I could not be sure when exactly, but possibly 2009 and 2010 because we did some big tours then.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I still get royalties every year from Take On Me, and other songs too. Everything I have recorded generates an income. There have also been years recently when I have made more money as an artist from my visual practice than from my music. My sculptures can sell for up to £100,000, depending on size. Typically though, a small painting or sculpture sells for around £20,000.</p><img id="i-adcf53828b3ee5c7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/14/4D1368EA00000578-5824429-image-a-68_1528551204136.jpg" height="308" width="634" alt="Mags co-wrote Take On Me and, shortly after it was released, bought a  AC Cobra sports car worth around £1 million today" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Did you make a lot of money in the 1980s?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A good year was 1986. But at the beginning, we were not really that business savvy – we felt awkward thinking about the business aspects and we just focused on the music. So we did not care about merchandising in the early days, and a lot of piracy went on. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The music industry was different back then. You did tours to promote your record sales, because the major money came from record sales. Now, it is the other way around. Certainly in terms of payments to the band members, the last 15 or 20 years have been better than the early days.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What is the most expensive thing you have ever bought yourself, just for fun?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A black AC Cobra, in the 1980s. It cost me £150,000. I should never have sold it. It would be worth more than £1 million now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What is the biggest money mistake you have made?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Selling my two-bed, two-bath, split-level flat in Kensington in 1990. I had bought it for about £200,000 in 1986 and sold it for about the same amount or less. It would be worth millions now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What has been your best money decision?</strong></p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Buying my family home, a large property by the ocean just outside Oslo, in the early 1990s. That was where my kids grew up. It was a good life decision as well as good money decision. I do not want to say exactly how much it is worth but I know it is a lot.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Do you save into a pension or invest in the stock market?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not into a pension. I do not really think about my retirement. I am not planning to stop working until I keel over. I do not personally invest in the stock market, but I do have some money invested. I leave decisions to a financial adviser now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Do you own any property?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As well as my home, I have a property in the South of France and also a mountain lodge in Norway. I do not own any property in the UK but I am contemplating buying something. I miss having a home here.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What is the one luxury that you treat yourself to?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Good food and good wine – and making sure friends have a good time. I treat myself to that as often as I possibly can, probably too often.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>If you were Chancellor of the Exchequer, what is the first thing you would do?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I would introduce a universal basic income for everyone on a level that ensures that nobody is living below the poverty line.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What is your number one financial priority?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To encourage my children to use money responsibly, for the greater good, rather than extravagantly. I do not want them to grow up differently from their peers.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The most money popstar Magne Furuholmen ever earned for a single performance of Take On Me was £2,000 a note, he reveals in our Me and my Money interview.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The flamboyant fund manager, who once spent more than £100,000 on a chicken coop dubbed Cluckingham Palace at his Gloucestershire mansion, has given hundreds of thousands to campaigns backing Britain’s separation from the European Union including Global Britain and the Democracy Movement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He is a longstanding supporter of fellow Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, funding the Conservative MP’s Election campaign in 2015. In 2007, he also helped Rees-Mogg set up an investment firm of his own, Somerset Capital Management, which has virtually no investments in the UK, but large holdings in Russia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In addition to its short positions against British shares, Odey Asset Management has taken a £150 million bet against the value of Government bonds.</p><img id="i-1074626dac451bf2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/17/4D13676E00000578-5824697-image-m-143_1528560060766.jpg" height="562" width="634" alt="Odey Asset Management has taken out more than £500 million ‘short’ positions on some of Britain’s biggest firms, implying that he expects a poor performance from them" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Specialist magazine Financial Adviser described this as investing ‘in such a way that he will profit if investor sentiment turns against the country’, which could happen if overseas investors pull out their cash because of fears of a hard Brexit. Odey declined to comment on his investment strategy. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In past interviews he said his decisions had been motivated by the belief that the Bank of England’s quantitative easing programme, under which £435 billion was printed to boost the economy, would lead to inflation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Odey was riding high in 2014 when his wealth, together with wife Nichola Pease, a former non-executive director at failed bank Northern Rock, was valued at £1.1 billion.

Around 70 per cent of people don’t make plans to ensure some else can look after their property and financial affairs should they be unable to do so themselves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Contrary to popular belief, nobody has an automatic right to make decisions on someone else’s behalf - even if they are related, married or in a civil partnership with them.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is why many people set up Lasting Power of Attorney while they are still in good mental health, as this ensures one or more trusted friends or relatives are legally entitled to act for them if necessary.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Getting an LPA is certainly advisable for anyone who plans to manage an investment portfolio throughout old age, as this involves work and the kind of financial acumen you might not have as you become frailer. </p><img id="i-e31fb368259a6b28" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/14/4D0263F200000578-0-image-m-23_1528377193152.jpg" height="418" width="306" alt="Fiona Heald: 'Around 70% of people don¿t make plans to ensure some else can look after their property and financial affairs'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Setting this up is far cheaper and easier than the process you face after someone falls too ill to obtain one, so you should explore whether it is still possible to get an LPA now, although it will depend on your father's state of mental capacity and whether he can understand what he is signing. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Assuming it is too late to get an LPA to deal with your father’s pension, someone needs to obtain authority to be his deputy instead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This requires an application to the Court of Protection. In your case it needs to be for a ‘property and financial affairs deputy order’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once granted, your father’s deputy can deal with his pension company and manage other assets and any income your father holds. Your father’s deputy could also appoint other professionals such as an independent financial adviser to assist.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is advisable that more than one person applies to become your father’s deputy. This is because if only one person is appointed, and they couldn’t act on your father’s behalf for any reason (for example, being on holiday, becoming bankrupt or death), then your father would be back to square one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Appointments should also be made ‘jointly and severally’, which means that any one deputy is able to act independently at any time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Court of Protection prefers family and friends to be appointed as deputies, as opposed to the local authority or a professional, such as a lawyer. However, if there are family disagreements or an individual’s assets are complex, it can be best to appoint a professional.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS money" data-version="2" id="mol-227acb30-6a54-11e8-add1-299f6864a159">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Lasting power of attorney helps families keep control if illness or accident strikes </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Why you need this now and how to set it up. <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/pensions/article-3930098/Lasting-power-attorney-need-one-set-up.html">Read more here.</a></p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Court forms are available on Gov.uk <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gov.uk/courts-tribunals/court-of-protection">here.</a> They require information regarding your father, all his assets, income and liabilities, a medical certificate and a declaration by each deputy to confirm they are suitable and will undertake their duties properly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s worth noting that obtaining the medical certificate can be a challenge as many NHS doctors will not complete the form, and those who do may charge up to £300.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Typically, it takes about a month to obtain all the information required. Many people find this process complex and so ask a lawyer to help.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having completed the forms, a £400 fee is payable to the Court of Protection. The Court will take about a month to issue the formal application.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In your case, it would be sensible to ask for an urgent order so that your father’s pension can be dealt with quickly. This would include the power to appoint a financial adviser to help deal with your father’s pension.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once the application is issued, you need to notify various family members, including your father even though he may not understand. This is to give everyone a chance to object to the appointment of a deputy if they want to.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS money" data-version="2" id="mol-206e0b40-6a54-11e8-add1-299f6864a159">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">What is income drawdown? </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Drawdown schemes allow you to take sums out of your pension pot while the rest remains invested. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But this involves risk and requires ongoing management to maximise returns, avoid spending your savings too quickly, and limit taxes on your income.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pension freedom reforms have led to growing numbers of people entering drawdown and shunning annuities, which are unpopular because they are poor value and restrictive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, annuities provide a guaranteed income for life with no monitoring or intervention needed during retirement, which makes having an LPA a less pressing matter although still important. </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Assuming no one objects, the Court will then consider how much security the deputies need to provide. This is an insurance bond which pays out should a deputy illegally take your father’s money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If this occurs, the insurance company will pursue the deputy. For £300,000 cover the annual premium is about £225. Approved insurer details are given by the Court.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once the Court knows the insurance bond is in place, they will issue the property and financial affairs deputy order (the Order) to your father’s deputies along with guidance so that they are aware of what they can and cannot do.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once the Order has been received, a separate deputy bank account needs to be set up to manage your father’s financial affairs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Order also needs to be sent to all financial companies where your father has accounts so they know who to deal with from now on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This whole process takes about six months. Once appointed, all deputies are supervised by the Office of the Public Guardian to which any further fees, such as the annual supervision fee and fees for the appointment of new deputies, are paid.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The supervision fee is £320 a year if you are managing more than £21,000 and £35 a year if it is less. The assessment fee is £100 for new deputies. All fees are payable out of your father’s money.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>My dad invested his pension in income drawdown, but he’s become too ill to manage his investments on his own and doesn’t have a financial adviser.

Paying off your student debt early would certainly leave you with more spare income, which may be attractive to a mortgage lender.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But you should weigh up your other options too, especially as student debt is relatively cheap compared to many other forms of borrowing. Perhaps you have more expensive debt you could repay such as an overdraft or credit card.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alternatively, you could use the money (that you would have used to repay the loan) to put towards a bigger deposit on your new home. Doing this would reduce the loan-to-value ratio of your mortgage and could unlock cheaper deals. Again, a good mortgage broker can help you choose the best option for your individual circumstances.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Rebecca Goodman, of This is Money, adds:</strong> If you are paying off your student loan and thinking about a mortgage, it’s worth weighing up all your options first.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’re managing your student loan repayments well and this isn’t affecting your overall income negatively, it is likely to be better for you to continue paying it off – rather than clearing the debt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This money could then be used to put towards a bigger deposit for your mortgage, which in turn could reduce the interest you pay on the loan, or it might be better served clearing off more expensive debts if you have them.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Will my student loan repayments affect my credit score and could this have a negative effect on a mortgage application?

Those four simple words can hold the key to investing success, so why on earth would anyone pay 65 per cent more for an investment than it is worth?</span> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is possible for investment trusts to be priced at a premium or a discount to the sum of their parts.

Why are some trusts trading at such big mark-ups and should you ever buy at a premium?

This means when markets perform well their investment returns can outperform the market.

The only way around this is to invest in an investment product, like Syncona, which already has a stake. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, the trust has a £88.6million holding in a small British biopharmaceutical company called Autolus.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The firm specialises in the exciting development and commercialisation of products aimed at curing cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Earlier in May, the company filed to go public and float its shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If all goes to plan, Syncona could make some serious returns on investment by cashing in on some or all of its 38.4 per cent stake in the company. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This drives up demand for the trust in the short term which, in turn, leads to an uptick in the trust's price tag as investors are happy to pay more for a slice of a trust tipped for substantial growth in the not too distant future.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Put simply, investors are taking a gamble - but one based on credible empirical data.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Primary Health Properties Trust</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Premium: 21.06</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ongoing charges:  1.99 per cent</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5 year performance: 91 per cent </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The trust seeks to provide quarterly income payments to investors by investing in healthcare real estate in the UK and Ireland and renting it out on long term leases backed by the government. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, while past performance is not necessary an indicator of future outcomes, it appears to be a key factor behind its valuation. The trust boasts a 4.66 per cent dividend yield and has managed to up its dividend payouts for 21 consecutive years.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what the future might hold for the trust's underlying investments is the real draw here. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The need for more healthcare facilities is acute as the UK population and the percentage of older people with greater medical needs continues to rise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With a portfolio of 306 healthcare centres and one under development, the trust is in a good position to profit from this trend. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The trust is also set to expand its operations in Ireland where the rental income is higher.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hughes said: 'The trust trades at a more modest premium but does so because of the specialist nature of the underlying assets and scarcity of them. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The trust owns over 300 healthcare facilities and given this focus benefits from very high occupancy and high levels of certainty over its income stream which creates a very attractive investment opportunity specially with interest rates so low. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'By having such a portfolio, it is difficult for competitors to replicate and therefore the shares of the trust are in high demand, hence the large premium.' </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Independent Investment Trust</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Premium: 16.40</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ongoing charges:  0.25 per cent</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5 year performance: 222 per cent </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The trust aims to generate good returns over the long term through investment in UK and overseas shares.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">How do you choose a good investment fund or trust?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are blessed with the rare gift of perfect timing, then diving into funds or investment trusts that are about to do very well - and then hopping back out near the top – will see you right.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most of us aren’t in possession of such flair, or a foolproof system, however, and our behavioural flaws tempt us into chasing yesterday’s winners rather than tomorrow’s.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A wiser course of action can be to buy and hold a consistent performer, something that can deliver solid, market-beating returns in as many years as possible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And if your fund manager can’t do that then you may as well just buy a tracker.</p><img id="i-8dfdd1bf8266a1e7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/09/16D42BDB000005DC-5813335-Choose_the_Tortoise_not_the_Hare_A_steady_and_consistent_perform-a-13_1528361965580.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="Choose the Tortoise not the Hare: A steady and consistent performer can beat trying to chase shoot the lights out winners each year - and the AIC has ranked 20 investment trusts" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Spotting these consistent performers can be notoriously difficult without the benefit of hindsight - and it will always involve a good dollop of luck.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But if you do believe it’s possible for active investors to outperform (a matter of some debate I know) you can try to weight the odds in your favour by picking carefully – looking for good managers, with a clearly defined and explained strategy, and a robust track record.</p><div>

Where two trusts had the same score, lower volatility of returns was used to rank them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, for example, Montanaro UK Smaller Companies, beat the average in eight years out of ten and secured sixth spot in the table, as it had volatility of return of 20.9 per cent, whereas Electra Private Equity was in 17th spot, despite also chalking up eight years, as its volatility was 34.1 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The top three trusts in the list all beat the average nine times and delivered big returns. These were Lindsell Train, up 714.4 per cent, Finsbury Growth &amp; Income, up 307.5 per cent, and F&amp;C Global Smaller Companies, up 297.4 per cent.</p><div class="money" id="mol-762e05f0-69a8-11e8-b588-eff387529d1d"> <table class="mol-table" data-swipe-article="false" width="100%"> <caption class="wocc">THE TOP 20 CONSISTENT INVESTMENT TRUSTS OVER A DECADE </caption> <tbody>  <tr>   <th>Rank</th>    <th>Company</th>    <th>AIC sector</th>    <th>No. of times above Overall Weighted Average</th>    <th>Volatility of Return</th>    <th>% Share price total return over 10 years to 30 April 2018</th>   </tr>    <tr>   <td>1</td>    <td>Lindsell Train</td>    <td>Global</td>    <td>9</td>    <td>15.48</td>    <td>714.42</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>2</td>    <td>Finsbury Growth &amp; Income</td>    <td>UK Equity Income</td>    <td>9</td>    <td>16.18</td>    <td>307.49</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>3</td>    <td>F&amp;C Global Smaller Companies </td>    <td>Global</td>    <td>9</td>    <td>16.38</td>    <td>297.39</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>4</td>    <td>Invesco Perpetual UK Smaller</td>    <td>UK Smaller Companies</td>    <td>9</td>    <td>17.7</td>    <td>301.73</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>5</td>    <td>JPMorgan US Smaller Companies </td>    <td>North American Smaller Companies</td>    <td>9</td>    <td>19.84</td>    <td>350.44</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>6</td>    <td>Montanaro UK Smaller Companies </td>    <td>UK Smaller Companies</td>    <td>8</td>    <td>20.91</td>    <td>175.64</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>7</td>    <td>Mid Wynd International Inv Tr PLC </td>    <td>Global</td>    <td>8</td>    <td>20.94</td>    <td>243.04</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>8</td>    <td>Dunedin Smaller Companies </td>    <td>UK Smaller Companies</td>    <td>8</td>    <td>21.83</td>    <td>233.66</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>9</td>    <td>TR Property </td>    <td>Property Securities</td>    <td>8</td>    <td>21.99</td>    <td>220.27</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>10</td>    <td>Herald</td>    <td>Sector Specialist: Small Media, Comms &amp; IT Cos</td>    <td>8</td>    <td>22.04</td>    <td>331.58</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>11</td>    <td>Edinburgh Dragon </td>    <td>Asia Pacific - Excluding Japan</td>    <td>8</td>    <td>22.15</td>    <td>151.38</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>12</td>    <td>Schroder Oriental Income </td>    <td>Asia Pacific - Excluding Japan</td>    <td>8</td>    <td>24.02</td>    <td>220.34</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>13</td>    <td>Standard Life UK Smaller Companies</td>    <td>UK Smaller Companies</td>    <td>8</td>    <td>24.92</td>    <td>387.26</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>14</td>    <td>Polar Capital Technology</td>    <td>Sector Specialist: Tech Media &amp; Telecomm</td>    <td>8</td>    <td>25.45</td>    <td>501.83</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>15</td>    <td>BlackRock Smaller Companies </td>    <td>UK Smaller Companies</td>    <td>8</td>    <td>26.37</td>    <td>409.79</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>16</td>    <td>Baillie Gifford Shin Nippon </td>    <td>Japanese Smaller Companies</td>    <td>8</td>    <td>27.15</td>    <td>645.42</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>17</td>    <td>Electra Private Equity </td>    <td>Private Equity</td>    <td>8</td>    <td>34.07</td>    <td>237.71</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>18</td>    <td>JPMorgan American </td>    <td>North America</td>    <td>7</td>    <td>12.75</td>    <td>254.67</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>19</td>    <td>Standard Life Equity Income </td>    <td>UK Equity Income</td>    <td>7</td>    <td>15.52</td>    <td>148.7</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>20</td>    <td>JPMorgan Elect Managed Growth </td>    <td>Global</td>    <td>7</td>    <td>16.17</td>    <td>151.34</td>   </tr> <tr>   <td colspan="3">Overall Weighted Average</td>            <td></td>    <td></td>    <td>133.63</td>   </tr><tr><td colspan="6"><span class="mol-style-italic">Source: AIC using Morningstar data to 30/4/2018 </span></td></tr></tbody> </table></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what does this tell us?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Firstly, that it is possible to find a better than average performer over a reasonably long period, with even the trust in 20th spot beating the average seven years out of ten.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the difficulty is that rival research has also shown that you need to look over much longer terms to identify a real tendency to outperform. Ten years sounds like a lot, but similar investments or style can continue to do well over a decade and then fall out of favour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It also delivers an interesting insight into how good managers can boost returns from lacklustre markets.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS money" data-version="2" id="mol-abf86330-69a6-11e8-b588-eff387529d1d">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">The trust that's up 714%</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of these 20 trusts is an outlier. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The top ranked Lindsell Train trust is notable for two things, its spectacular return and that its shares consistently trade at a big premium to the sum of its parts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is currently 34 per cent, as we explain in our look at the <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/diyinvesting/article-5758683/Why-buy-investment-trust-65-premium.html">Five trusts with the biggest premiums</a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is largely due to the fact that the trust itself owns a big stake of the Lindsell Train investment management company run by Michael Lindsell and Nick Train – investors suspect this business would is worth considerably more than its current stated value if it were ever sold.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is evidenced by its being the key driver to the trust’s long-term performance, rising as a percentage of the net asset value from below 10 per cent a decade ago to 42 per cent today.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Seven out of the 20 trusts have a UK focus, the AIC said, which is impressive considering the UK stock market’s comparatively modest performance over the past decade.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What I also find interesting is that seven are smaller companies trusts, which might not be incontrovertible proof that skilled active managers are particularly worth backing in the less well-researched world of small caps, but gives an extra bit of heft to the theory.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So should you just buy the 20 trusts in this list and put your feet up?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Probably not. Just because something has done well in the past doesn’t mean future conditions will favour it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You need to assess how you think things will play out, along with an investment’s value and quality. But weighing up where consistency comes from is food for thought.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One element identified by Peter Ewins, manager of third-placed F&amp;C Global Smaller Companies, is avoiding companies with too much debt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another is to look only for those that qualify as ‘exceptional companies’, according to Nick Train, manager of second-placed Finsbury Growth &amp; Income.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: We have found that if you own good companies for long enough then good things tend to happen for investors.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Luck must have played a part, for instance FGT has enjoyed takeovers over the year – Cadbury and more recently Dr Pepper and Fidessa. But perhaps good companies make their own luck?’ </p><div class="moduleFull"><div class="money item">

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here is a short summary of the taxes you face when purchasing a property in the UK.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">1) PROPERTY TRANSFER TAXES</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Usually known as stamp duty (SDLT in England and Northern Ireland, LBTT in Scotland and LTT in Wales).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When a property is transferred from one person to another, stamp duty will be payable by the purchaser. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rate changes depending on whether it is freehold or leasehold, whether it is commercial or residential and what country it is in.</p><img id="i-dcc800f961ea249d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/04C69A91000007D0-5812499-image-a-48_1528291414630.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Stamp duty: When a property is transferred from one person to another, stamp duty will be payable" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rates of SDLT on residential properties range from 2 per cent to 15 per cent and can include a surcharge for second homes – this is often cited as one of the reasons for the decline in buy to let properties.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">2) INHERITANCE TAX</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The significant increase in property prices has brought many more owners into the inheritance tax net. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When a property is passed down, most typically following a death, Inheritance Tax is incurred. This will usually be payable on the second death (as most estates are left to the surviving spouse). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">George Osborne introduced an additional tax allowance for family homes when he was chancellor but this operates in a complex way and is not always available.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">3) VAT</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although VAT is not generally payable on purchases of residential property, home improvements are subject to VAT in the vast majority of cases. Major improvements such as loft extensions or adding on rooms will incur a significant VAT charge as the builder will have to add on 20 per cent to his costs.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">4) CAPITAL GAINS TAX</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your main home is often exempt from capital gains tax, but second homes and holiday homes are not. For many years non-residents did not pay capital gains tax: this has changed and residential property gains are subject to this tax. The Government has announced that it plans to increase this tax to all types of UK property from 2019.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">5) ANNUAL TAX ON ENVELOPED DWELLINGS </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">For many years the UK was a very benign place for foreign investment in property and it was relatively simple for non-residents to legally avoid tax. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the ways this was achieved was to hold property via a company often registered outside the UK. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This has changed: residential properties valued at more than £500,000 and which are not owned by individuals, for example properties owned by companies (either UK resident or non-UK resident), can be charged ATED. </p><img id="i-65af6411274f6ed4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/0566C1B5000003E8-5812499-image-a-50_1528291579898.jpg" height="500" width="634" alt="Times change: For many years the UK was a very benign place for foreign investment in property and it was relatively simple for non-residents to legally avoid tax" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">ATED is charged at an annual amount at progressive rates determined by the property value. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are a number of exemptions for this, such as property rental businesses. Where an actual charge to the ATED arises, higher rates of capital gains tax can apply to gains arising on the disposal of the property.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">6) COUNCIL TAX/BUSINESS RATES</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Depending on where you live in the UK, your home is subject to council tax. Although the tax is used by local authorities to raise funds to meet the cost of local services in the area for which they have responsibility, it is nonetheless charged on the value of property. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the case of commercial property, this is implemented through a charge to business rates which is calculated by reference to the value of the property and a multiplier determined by the size of the business.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All of the above taxes apply to properties which are owner occupied. If you receive rent for your property, there are additional taxes to consider.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">7) INCOME TAX</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you let your property you need to consider income tax, this applies to both residents and non-residents. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are a non-UK resident, individual or company renting in the UK, you are subject to UK income tax on the profits of your trade/property rental business. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The loan interest deduction rules for buy to let investors are changing - the effect will be that in some cases owners will pay tax on ‘income for tax purposes’ that is greater than their real income.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">8) CORPORATION TAX</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">UK resident companies are chargeable to UK corporation tax on the profits of their property trade/property rental business. </p><img id="i-af08a320732ce5b6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/4CF98D0B00000578-5812499-image-a-2_1528292064305.jpg" height="460" width="306" alt="Paul Falvey is a tax partner at accountancy and business advisory firm BDO LLP" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">This law is expected to change to include non-UK resident companies letting UK property from April 2020. Currently, non-UK companies pay income tax on their rent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Property ownership is highly taxed; this is not surprising given that property is easy to identify, difficult to hide and most often very valuable. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Property investors sometimes overlook the amount of tax they will pay over their lifetime (or sometimes beyond) of their ownership of property. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even your main home is not completely tax free as you will almost certainly have paid stamp duty, will incur VAT on home improvements and maintenance and your heirs could also pay inheritance tax.<span class="mol-style-italic"> </span></p><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Paul Falvey, a tax partner at accountancy and business advisory firm BDO LLP, says most people who are looking to purchase a property are aware that they may have to pay stamp duty but, whether you’re buying your first house, a commercial property or a holiday home, there are many more taxes to consider.

About a car.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ferrari is at pains to point out that this phenomenally high performance car with racing pedigree is designed to be as easy and fulfilling to drive on the road by ‘drivers of all types', whether race-track pros or high net-worth petrolheads.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And you will need deep pockets, of course. The price for a 488 Pista starts at £252,765 before you add any of the potentially very expensive extras. That includes £2,112 for the four-point harness, £8,640 for the go faster racing stripe, and £14,208 for the carbon-fibre wheels alone.</p><img id="i-d66f90f8950e0f73" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/13/4CF83C9500000578-5811977-image-a-10_1528286952349.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The new supercar’s Pista name means track and Ferrari claims it can be both a racer out there and civilised for the road" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new supercar’s Pista name may not translate so well into English from the Italian, but simply means track.

Pretty phenomenal, as you might expect. Especially for a self-confessed ‘ordinary driver' for whom it makes light work of piloting a supercar.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ferrari say the new 488 Pista builds and improves upon the earlier 488 GTB iteration and the previous 458 Speciale model, and is lighter, faster and more ‘extreme’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is powered by a mighty 4.0 litre (3,902cc) V8 engine developing 720 horsepower linked to a slick 7-speed dual clutch automatic gearbox with manual override, via paddles on the steering wheel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It accelerates at blistering speed from rest to 0-62mph in just 2.85 seconds – and up to 124mph in just 7.6 seconds – reaching a potential top speed of 211mph.

This is helped by a clever S-Duct used for the first time on a road-going car. It’s basically a gap behind the front bumper that forces air between the bumper and the bonnet and then over the front windscreen, boosting downforce over the front axle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are sharper gear-shifts and lashings of lightweight carbon-fibre in the functional racing-style interior.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It still had room for my hefty laptop bag in the under-the-bonnet ‘boot’.

Then an intermediary handling the claim made a right old mess.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Zurich, the insurer that underwrites your policy, says your claim was valid, as your fainting had nothing to do with any pre-existing condition. The hospital misled you on this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You contacted the insurance assistance team at 9.59 and they replied at 10.54 asking for details and the likely discharge date. Costs at that point were estimated at €2,500 by the hospital.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The assistance team spoke with you that afternoon and ran through the questionnaire, when you were told that you might not be covered if your claim was related to an existing condition.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The assistance team contacted the hospital the following day, however you had already been discharged and given a Fit To Fly certificate by a doctor.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You called to discuss your claim again on April 16. Zurich has listened to the call and, when you said you had paid the hospital, an agent shrieked: ‘Why did you do that?’ This should not have happened and Zurich has made this clear to the agent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You were asked for receipts and then given an incorrect number to call about your claim. The hospital then appears to have incorrectly told you the claim would not be paid. There was a further delay, and it was not until April 24 that Zurich had a reply from the hospital.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">You then received an email on April 26, which, the agent admits, was ‘a little blunt’. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A further letter contained mistakes, not least being addressed wrongly. After this, Zurich called a senior team meeting to sort things out. Finally, your claim has been sorted out. In sterling terms, Zurich will be coughing up around £4,500, which underlines the value of travel insurance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You paid a €2,000 deposit to the hospital and got €1,910 back, but Zurich refunded your £75 excess to cover this. Medical bills of €4,916 will be paid directly to the hospital. They will also cover the €80 doctor’s call-out fee and add €25 hospital benefit for the 24 hours you spent in hospital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I must add that when under great stress, we do not always remember seemingly trivial things such as receipts and, in your case, you were clearly put under great pressure by the hospital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But in future, I’d suggest you get a more specialist policy and please tell the insurer about all your pre-existing medical conditions. It may make your policy more expensive, but this would be tiny besides the cost of a rejected claim.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-1358adf0-6902-11e8-b43c-cf28c106798f">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">You Have Your Say -  </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <img id="i-b64512e7d196e78d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/21/4CF3B2B300000578-0-image-a-2_1528232013824.jpg" height="289" width="284" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Every week, Money Mail receives hundreds of your letters and emails about our stories.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Savers are being tempted to give up valuable final salary pensions and run the risk of investing their pots in the financial markets instead, but whether this is a sensible idea will rest on your individual circumstances. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So where do you start if you are considering this crucial retirement decision?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You must pay for financial advice before moving a final salary pension worth £30,000-plus, which is an important safeguard against making an irreversible decision that could ruin your retirement if it goes wrong.  So, it's a useful exercise to find out if there any obvious red flags BEFORE before you fork out for professional advice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pension giant Aegon has therefore compiled the following seven questions to ask yourself at the outset - with the very big caveat that this is for illustration only and should not determine your decision. A decent financial adviser will go into all your circumstances in detail and give you a fully informed recommendation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Employers often dangle gigantic offers potentially worth hundreds of thousands of pounds in front of savers to clear expensive obligations to pay final salary - also known as 'defined benefit' - pensions off their books.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Workers who accept such deals give up a guaranteed income for life, and typically generous payouts to spouses should they die before them, in exchange for large sums paid into inferior pensions they must invest themselves. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But they gain greater control over their fund, the ability to pull all the cash from a pension after the age of 55, and much more flexibility over who is allowed to inherit their retirement pots.</p><img id="i-7dbbd38528952295" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/16/4CE75FCC00000578-5804073-Source_Aegon-a-12_1528125199543.jpg" height="743" width="962" alt="Source: Aegon" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-1e7cdf40-6807-11e8-af06-03ddfe39cf0b">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">How did you answer and what do your results mean? </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The table sets out some of questions which may help you decide whether or not you wish to seek advice on transferring from a defined benefit or final salary scheme,' says Aegon.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If your answers include a number of greens, then as a rule of thumb, it may be worth exploring further although this DOES NOT suggest you should actually transfer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If you have one or more red answer, then the rule of thumb is it may be less worth exploring transferring although again this DOES NOT mean you definitely should not transfer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If you seek advice, your adviser will consider all of your personal circumstances and make a personal recommendation based on these.' </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pitfalls of giving up final salary pensions too readily were exposed in the recent British Steel debacle. In that case,<a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/pensions/article-5391155/Vulture-advisers-bamboozled-British-Steel-savers-say-MPs.html">vulture advisers swooped in to exploit workers</a> in a mis-selling scandal that MPs warned could threaten many other savers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Watchdogs could<a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/pensions/article-5545083/Advisers-face-ban-no-transfer-no-fee-final-salary-pension-offers.html"> ban financial advisers from offering 'no transfer, no fee' deals</a> to savers looking to ditch final salary pensions as a result, due to fears such offers cause conflicts of interest that can influence their recommendations. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Financial Conduct Authority is also looking at whether advisers should offer a 'triage service', which means they could give savers an initial heads-up on whether it is worth paying for a full-scale recommendation on a transfer. However, its current consultation suggests it would place severe restrictions on such an approach in case this was taken as advice. The FCA is due to announce proposals in the autumn.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aegon is in favour of the triage approach, saying it would be beneficial for everyone to cut short the process, saving time and money and allowing advisers to focus on customers more likely to benefit from transferring.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'In medical terms, "triage" involves a professional assessing an individual’s circumstances and determining next steps and their priority,' said Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon. ' But the triage being proposed for defined benefit transfers excludes any professional assessment and is closer to self-diagnosis through google.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We are calling for the FCA to explore what more advisers can offer within guidance to help customers reach an early decision. It’s positive that the FCA has set out a non-exhaustive list of considerations for advisers and we’d like to explore if this could be turned into a standardised traffic lights guide for consumers wondering if it’s worth their while seeking advice. This could be promoted by advisers, guidance bodies and trustees.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Cameron believes the FCA should explore how 'no transfer, no fee' - also known as 'contingent' - charges could continue so advisers and their clients have a range of options for paying for advice, and that isolated instances of bad practice shouldn't constrain this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Contingent charging comes in many shapes and sizes, including separate fees for different stages of the advice process. We believe an outright ban of all types would mean fewer individuals would seek advice, widening the "advice gap".</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There is now huge attention from the regulator in this field, and advice will be checked by the adviser firm’s compliance department and a pensions transfer specialist.' </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Why are people giving up final salary pensions?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Final salary or 'defined benefit' pensions are typically generous and provide a guaranteed income for life. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But increasing number of people are tempted to give them up for a range of reasons - the huge offers they receive from employers, the desire to invest their savings in the hope they will continue to grow, and the opportunity to leave whatever is left over to loved ones when they die. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, pension freedoms launched in 2015 give people in 'defined contribution' schemes, where they and employers contribute to a pot that's invested for retirement, the power to do what they want with their savings once they reach the age of 55. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those still saving into final salary pensions cannot take advantage of these freedoms unless they transfer to a defined contribution scheme, but they have to get financial advice if their pot is worth £30,000-plus. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, leaving a final salary pension scheme means people must bear all the investment risks to their retirement pot going forward.</p><img id="i-3d619a1ec03645e8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/16/4CE75FC800000578-5804073-image-m-20_1528125290679.jpg" height="759" width="962" alt="Pension freedom: Savers are being tempted to give up valuable final salary pensions and run the risk of investing their pots in the financial markets instead, but whether this is a sensible idea will rest on your individual circumstances" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-4527e340-6804-11e8-b203-c93f86f22d46">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">What else should you consider before moving a final salary pension?</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Guidance to British Steel savers offered by Michelle Cracknell of The Pensions Advisory Service applies to any one thinking of giving up valuable final salary pension benefits.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness’ – according to author George Orwell. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet despite such a daunting challenge many still dream of penning a masterpiece – and embarking on a lucrative and rewarding career.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, we share tips from those who have written a book – including secrets on how to get one published and make some money.</p><img id="i-644320ff1dd74756" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/14/4CD7858800000578-5798259-image-a-1_1527946174124.jpg" height="381" width="634" alt="Tracey Waples, a 52-year-old mother of two, invested £4,000 in a six-month course with Faber &amp; Faber after embarking on a first novel" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>DEVELOP AN INITIAL IDEA</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An idea - whether a clever plot, unusual character or inspiration from real life – is only the start.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many novices launch into writing projects with great enthusiasm only to give up after a few weeks. They find their story soon runs out of steam or ends up getting lost in a vague plot. After an initial rush of energy they shelve the project.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Completing the task requires that you build a plot structure and take time to flesh it out. Even with a great idea and commitment to seeing it through, professional guidance is often essential.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The £25 Writers’ &amp; Artists’ Yearbook 2018 provides details of writing courses that can help. Among the most highly regarded are those run by publishers such as Faber &amp; Faber, Curtis Brown Creative and Penguin Random House. You might also be inspired by local adult education courses in writing which can be found on a website Hotcourses.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tracey Waples, a 52-year-old mother of two, invested £4,000 in a six-month course with Faber &amp; Faber after embarking on a first novel. It was worthwhile because it helped get her book ready for publication.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tracey already had a character in her head for the book I Want Never Gets and believes having someone she could believe in was vital for success.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She says: ‘Mulling the story over while out for walks helped prior to putting pen to paper. It made me discover that the main character was a nasty piece of work. But I did not know where the story was heading until it was completed. Writing can feel like uncovering a story already there – a bit like archaeology – but I found the expert guidance from the Faber &amp; Faber course to be invaluable.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tracey, who lives in Albury, Hertfordshire, adds: ‘It felt pretentious calling myself a writer but being on a course surrounded by like-minded people eased that self-conscious concern. It is important not to be precious with a book and be prepared to rewrite sections until it feels right.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Self-help books on writing can also provide support. Among these are On Writing by Stephen King and Nail Your Novel by Roz Morris.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Morris says: ‘Failing to finish a novel is a common problem. You must have a plot that carries you through to the end. Study other books in the genre you hope to write in – looking at key aspects such as the tricks used to keep a reader hooked.’</p><img id="i-44537e341c9bc9d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/14/4CD670D100000578-5798259-image-m-68_1527944415276.jpg" height="735" width="634" alt="Self-help books on writing can  provide support including Nail Your Novel by Roz Morris " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tracey Waple’s book is published by Endeavour Media and will be available later this month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WRITE FOR LOVE AND NOT MONEY</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aspriring authors have to accept that all the blood, sweat and tears which go into writing a novel may count for nothing. Dedication is essential.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clare Empson struggled for ten years to get her book into shape before finally finding a publisher. Her debut, Him, is a dark love story that will be published by Orion on August 23.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 50-year-old says: ‘I would sacrifice weekends away with the family to make progress. I spent countless hours alone writing and rewriting. At one point it got me down and I wondered if it would all come to nothing. But I realised I loved writing too much. Would it make me happier if I simply stopped? The answer was a big no.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To keep motivated Clare started meeting up with two other writers and they still regularly get together to share thoughts and ideas.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The mother-of-three, who lives in Mere, Wiltshire, says: ‘I also learnt that it was not simply a case of writing a book and then ending it. What comes next is a lot of rewriting – taking expert advice from agents who are skilled at publishing books. You should never stop looking to improve and make your novel sharper and getting the right pace for it.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clare is one of the talented – and lucky – ones. She has signed a six- figure international book deal for her novel and a sequel through agent Curtis Brown. But she says money should not be the motivation for writing a book – there are far easier ways to get rich.</p><img id="i-6dcf56fffec1b65f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/14/4CD671DA00000578-5798259-image-m-72_1527944443751.jpg" height="466" width="306" alt="Clare's debut, Him, is a dark love story that will be published by Orion on August 23" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-22e46b548ad752f8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/14/4CD670CD00000578-5798259-image-a-73_1527944452796.jpg" height="466" width="306" alt="Clare Empson struggled for ten years to get her book into shape before finding a publisher" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">A first-time novelist might receive an advance of just £3,000 plus a cut of any sales – known as royalties – of some 8 per cent. The advance is recouped from royalties so the bigger this is the longer it will take to earn any royalties. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Writers can be dazzled by the exceptions such as Harry Potter author JK Rowling who is now worth £500 million. But the vast majority of authors do not make enough money to live off and write simply for love – keeping the day job going.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>TAKE A DISCIPLINED APPROACH</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A story idea is the easy bit. The hard part is sitting down to complete the book and find a publisher.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Famous novelists such as James Bond author Ian Fleming managed to write bestsellers in less than a month. But the skill and dedication to get to this level took years – with failure and rewrites part of the process.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other greats such as W Somerset Maugham made the written word look easy to put down on paper – yet took ‘laborious days’ of studying others to develop their skills. The 20th Century novelist took a decade before completing novel The Painted Veil.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tracey Waples knows all too well the sacrifices required to write a novel. She would get up at 5.30 every morning so she could start penning her psychological thriller.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She says: ‘For me the secret was to have a routine where I put aside time every morning to write. It was not about reaching a certain word count but instilling a disciplined habit even when I was not in the mood to write.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>SEEK AN AGENT</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sam Copeland is a literary agent at Rogers, Coleridge &amp; White in Notting Hill, West London. He receives 300 pitches a month – almost all of which end up in the bin. He might take on four new authors in a year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says: ‘People will always want to write books. But to get it on the bookshelves what you really need is an agent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Most publishers will not touch you without one. Also, an agent is key to making sure a book is in the best shape possible – and help you strike the best deal.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Copeland believes writers should avoid so-called vanity publishing – where you end up paying a publisher to get your book on the market. A good agent, he says, will edit your book for free.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But he warns: ‘There is no way to sugar coat this. For 99.5 per cent of manuscripts sent in the answer is no. We are not right every time but we are skilled at spotting something with potential. I am afraid that rejection is part of the writing journey.’</p><img id="i-92b48903e467623f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/13/4CD6721600000578-5798259-image-a-66_1527944376560.jpg" height="420" width="634" alt="Fifty Shades Of Grey writer EL James is worth £40million" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Copeland adds: ‘There are no hidden secrets – and gimmicks do not work. It does not matter what the subject is – a script must stand out as exceptional. It must be a book you find hard to put down. A budding author must write with confidence and authority so the words feel right where they sit on the page.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The fortunate handful that are accepted usually hand over 15 per cent of all the money they make from their books to the agent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What Copeland and other agents typically want is a brief synopsis, along with the book’s first three chapters. Details of agents can be found in the industry bible Writers’ &amp; Artists’ Yearbook 2018.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>GET OUT AND SELL</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Writing a book is just the start. You then have to make sure people go out and buy the novel. Those fortunate enough to have an agent who has signed them up to a well-known publisher can rely on the company public relations machine to kick into action – contacting bookshops to stock the novel, organising a launch party and seeing if they can also have the book translated and sold abroad.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But others must do the marketing themselves. There is plenty you can do to help shift your novel off the bookshelf.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Roz Morris says: ‘Formulate a plan of attack. See if you can get family and friends to contact their local bookshop and ask them for a copy of the book – and to order more in.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also contact local press – newspapers and radio stations – for interviews about your book and try to organise a signing at a local bookshop.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kim Nash of publisher Bookouture believes it is important to take advantage of the internet – self-publicising on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter plus exploring the world of blogs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She says: ‘There is an army of book bloggers out there eager to review new novelists. These include Kim The Bookworm – which is me, CrimeBookJunkie and Random Things Through My Letterbox. Ask them to look at your novel as it helps spread the word.’</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-461532f0-6663-11e8-b97a-ffe5b47f3abc">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Ebooks and even self-publishing COULD earn authors millions </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><img id="i-d4318b6e75dbbc63" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/13/4CD6721200000578-5798259-image-a-65_1527944368991.jpg" height="400" width="284" alt="Self-starter: Fifty Shades Of Grey writer EL James is worth £40million" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">You do not need a book deal to get your first novel published. There are self-publishing and ebook options aplenty.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Novelist and writing tutor Roz Morris says self-publishing is not just for amateurs as many professional authors also use it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The bestselling erotic thriller Fifty Shades Of Grey by EL James began as a self-published ebook in 2011 before being snapped up by a mainstream publisher and turned into a film. The author is now worth £40 million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Morris says: ‘The self-publishing route gives writers independence and freedom of choice. But it should not be seen as an easy way out. You still need professional guidance and editing to ensure the book is of the highest quality.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Morris, whose self-published works include Lifeform Three and Not Quite Lost, believes a good starting place is the Alliance of Independent Authors.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This association can provide guidance on reputable firms which can help you self-publish in print and online as well as provide editorial support.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hiring a professional editor to go through a manuscript can cost more than £2,000 but Morris believes it is money well spent if it transforms a rough draft into a well-crafted novel. Joining a writing group can also help.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can fork out £200 or so for software that puts a book into ebook form and allows you to choose an off-the-peg front cover. An independently designed cover may cost £400.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You might consider self-publishing providers such as Amazon, IngramSpark, Clays, and CPI. Amazon – through its Kindle Book Publishing arm – charges £790 for a package including software, proofreading and cover design for both print-on-demand and ebooks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kim Nash of ebook publisher Bookouture believes companies like hers are also worth contacting because of the expert support they provide. She says: ‘Producing a book does not cost the author a penny with us – though you are only accepted if we believe the book has potential.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We offer editing expertise and help with marketing and the cover. You get no advance but receive 45 per cent royalties of any income from selling your ebook.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite the price of online books being between 99p and £1.99, Nash points out that its bestselling author Angela Marsons has sold 2.8 million books online. So ebooks can also be lucrative. </p></div>                        </div><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Despite such a daunting challenge many still dream of penning a masterpiece – and embarking on a lucrative and rewarding career.

  </div>
</div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here instead we’ve listed six ways you can boost your broadband signal right now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1. Keep your router away from baby monitors, microwaves and mirrors</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’re using wifi, the nearer you are to the router, the better your connection will be and this can make a big difference to the speed you’re receiving. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Whilst we have all been inclined to lift our phones over our head in pursuit of better receptions, you are less likely to see people picking up their router and waggling it about seeking higher speeds but actually where your router sits can actually have an effect on the signal,’ explains Vix Leyton, spokesperson for Broadband Choices.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She says it’s better to have it higher up and away from anything that might interfere with the signal – think things like baby monitors and microwaves.</p><img id="i-9f10a40066bcbf2a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/16/4C9D34F500000578-5771939-image-a-9_1527260571708.jpg" height="363" width="634" alt="Ethernet cables might be better if your signal's bad because they transmit data faster than wifi" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Try not to surround it by metal objects, and – bizarrely as it may sound – wifi can reflect, so keep them clear of mirrors and reflective surfaces’ she adds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Water can also absorb the signal so if you have a fish tank, for example, keep your router away from it if possible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> <strong>2. Watch out who you give your password to</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The more people who have your wifi password, and use it at the same time, the slower it will be.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you haven’t got a password, or yours is easy to guess, anyone nearby could potentially log onto it and use it for free. Not only could this be a security risk, it means your connection will slow down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you need to set a password, or change your existing one, open your router settings by entering its IP address into your web browser. You'll find the address printed on the router itself somewhere, and it will look like this: 192.168.0.1.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You may need to log in - the admin password and username will also often be printed on the router, but if it isn't, check with your provider for further instructions. From your settings you can then set up or change the password.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. A broadband booster or wifi extender can help</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are a number of different gadgets on sale which claim to boost the speed and reliability of your broadband connection.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, these are designed more for larger homes where there are spots the wifi signal doesn’t reach and won’t actually make a difference to the quality of connection you’re getting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You'll need to plug it in somewhere inbetween your router and the areas of your home where you can't get wifi, or where the signal is weaker, and it will pick up your router's signal and extend it.  </p><img id="i-607b03fb0b7e7eb0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/14/4C8D234500000578-5771939-image-a-1_1527342024187.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="If your wifi is slow it may be worth changing the channel of your router to get a better signal" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4. Try changing the channel of your home network</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If your wifi is slow or continually cuts out, it may be worth changing the channel of your router.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most routers run off the 2.4Ghz frequency spectrum which is made up of several different channels, some of which can be clearer than others.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some routers will automatically switch to different channels, but you could also try manually doing this to improve your signal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How you do this will depend on the type of router you have and there will be instructions in the user manual. For most, it’s a quick job and the following instructions, from Broadbandchoices, show you how to change it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1. First find the best channel using an app like Wifi Analyzer which is free and displays less crowded channels to switch to.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2. Log on to your router, and look for the wireless network settings. Find the prompt that lets you choose a channel, and select the number you want to switch to.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">3. If there's an 'Auto' option, always pick this - the router will do the wireless analytics for you and automatically pick the clearest channel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">4. Wait a few minutes for everything to adjust, and see if your speeds improve.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5. Use an Ethernet cable instead of relying on wifi</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An Ethernet cable is a little old fashioned, and might seem like a step back from using a wireless connection, but it should improve your broadband signal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These cables provide a faster service than wifi because they transmit data at a quicker pace. You also won’t need to worry about obstacles such as thick walls or microwaves getting in the way and causing an interference.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>6. Where you position your router is important</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The position of your router can make a big difference to the speed and accuracy of your broadband signal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Therefore try and keep the router in the middle of your home, so its signal can reach every room, and don't shut it away in a cupboard as this can affect the signal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It needs to be visible so if it’s out-of-sight or you’ve put it in a corner of the house away from where you usually are, the speed and distance the wifi can travel will reduce.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other things to watch out for include thick walls, as if the concrete is dense it can dull your broadband signal, while steel joists within the wall can also affect the signal. Also try and avoid placing the router directly next to your window as some of the signal will be sent outside if so. </p><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Switching providers can be a first step to improving your service, but this might not always be possible and doesn’t guarantee your broadband connection will be improved.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>This Is Money</dc:publisher><dc:creator>R Rickardstrauss</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-01T10:14:33.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Six top tips to boosting your broadband </mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-01T10:14:33.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/bills/article-5762569/Going-holiday-cat-gets-sick-Heres-pet-owners-claim-travel-insurance.html" title="Going on holiday and your cat gets sick?

Here are some of the best from our report on how council tax bills in some parts of Britain have risen nine times faster than the cost of living...</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">What ludicrous council tax increases. I live in Hillingdon, West London. We haven’t had an increase for more than ten years and we have great services.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>S.T, by email.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">With council tax you can’t shop around. I wonder what the bills would be if there was a competitive system. Maybe a lawyer can bring a class action against a council or the Government.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>T.S, Caernarfon.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Council tax is higher than my water, gas and electricity bills combined. That’s disgusting.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>N.S, Southampton.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">In 1971 my council rate bill included all water charges including supply and sewerage. The cost was £75.45. Today council tax, water supply and sewerage cost £2,400 which exceeds inflation by a long way.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>J.G, Essex.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Our local authority roads are so bad that the council reduced road speeds to 20mph. This was clearly a desperate bid to reduce claims from pothole damage.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>P.B, Edinburgh.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">In Dorset, wages are low and housing is expensive. A local purchase tax on goods would be a better idea, and then struggling households would not have to suffer high taxation.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>T.S, by email.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Council tax is a regressive tax and needs to go. The majority of the tax bill is being weighted on the poorest in terms of the percentage of their income.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>A.A, Manchester.</strong></p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">We moved to Scottish Power in February. We told them we would need a gas meter as we were having gas central heating installed. We had gas central heating from June 6. We then had two bills dating back to February onwards, so I told them we didn’t have any gas then.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">When I rang I was told we didn’t even have an account.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Scottish Power has been shocking but to change supplier our gas meter has to be registered. This has not happened.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">I have taken this up with the ombudsman, and Scottish Power said they would have everything done within 14 days. It wasn’t. I complained again to the ombudsman. They told me they had spoken to Scottish Power and I had to ring its ombudsman team.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">When I called they hadn’t a clue why I was ringing.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>L.W., Stockton-on-Tees.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Scottish Power says your gas meter was installed on March 31 last year but admits there was an issue in registering it on the national database.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Apparently this was sorted as part of your ombudsman complaint and you were awarded £230, closing that issue. But there remains a £276.56 gas bill. This relates to the period before your gas and electricity account were combined. The bill covers the period from April 11 to November 26. Although you would have used no gas in the first two months you would have used it from June.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No payments were made towards the gas account during this period. You accept this. Scottish Power has apologised and reduced your bill to £150 as a goodwill gesture. You have accepted this offer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">I had a mortgage many years ago with Alliance &amp; Leicester. I know there was payment protection attached to it but I sold the property and repaid the mortgage in 1999.</span></p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">I contacted Santander and they said they could do nothing without the account number. After all these years I have only got the address of the property. They continue to fob me off.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>G. L., Portsmouth.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I think it’s a trifle unfair to accuse Santander of fobbing you off when you have only now gotten around to complaining despite the PPI scandal being covered in the Press since the early 2000s.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alliance &amp; Leicester itself was fined £7 million for its part in the controversy in October 2008 — a story which received prominent coverage in the Daily Mail and other papers. Santander took over Alliance &amp; Leicester in July 2008. I doubted they would be able to help but asked them to take another look just in case.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They tell me that after an extensive search they are unable to locate the mortgage account or any PPI policy. They also received information from Aviva, which ran the PPI policies, confirming there is no trace of one for you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In line with the Data Protection Act, Santander points out it is only required to store records for up to six years after an account is terminated or a financial relationship ceases.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you don’t have details of your mortgage from 19 years ago perhaps you shouldn’t be surprised that Santander also doesn’t have any record of it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While payment protection rightly has an appalling reputation I note yours was to cover a mortgage. MPPI was very different to PPI flogged with credit cards. Alliance &amp; Leicester’s fine related to PPI sold with personal loans.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The government encouraged buying MPPI with the aim of protecting mortgage payments and keeping people in their homes if they lose their job or become unable to work. This was at a time when it was pulling back on state benefits for mortgage interest paid to those who lost their jobs. So even though you had MPPI it may not have been mis-sold.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having said that, Santander stopped selling MPPI in January 2012.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-3bb22250-637a-11e8-954e-91fa5c997a80">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">STRAIGHT TO THE POINT </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">I tried to take a dress back to a shop which didn’t fit.

However, if there is nothing wrong with it you must rely on the shop’s own returns policy.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Investment guru Warren Buffett famously said that the ideal length of time to hold an investment is ‘for ever’. It is a strategy which many professional investors are adopting as the FTSE 100 reaches new highs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The idea is that if you can find an investment fund or company whose share price keeps growing year after year, then there should be little reason to sell or move your money elsewhere.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Holding investments for the long term can be rewarding and a cheaper way to invest. Each time you buy and sell shares it costs money, which eats into your returns. But if you only buy once, you minimise trading costs.</p><img id="i-6f9ab5f377554ae5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/13/4C6BAFBC00000578-5747953-image-a-3_1526734467564.jpg" height="449" width="634" alt="Helping hand: Investment guru Warren Buffett advised holding shares ‘for ever’" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">While investment funds levy a mix of ongoing charges, they will be lower if the manager is not buying and selling companies often. This is because they are not racking up trading costs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nick Train is manager of the successful Lindsell Train Global Equity fund. He is renowned for his buy and hold style of investing. He famously once went three years without investing in a new company. The fund’s most recent purchase, last summer, was to buy into financial services behemoth Hargreaves Lansdown.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although some may argue it is his business to search out better investments, the results of his strategy are compelling. Over the past five years, a £1,000 investment would have more than doubled in value to £2,250.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By way of comparison, an equivalent investment in the average global fund would have grown to £1,610. Train says: ‘If you can find a company so reliable in its business performance that it carries on increasing its share price decade after decade then you would hold it forever, wouldn’t you? Some do just that, but they are rare.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One example he likes is Young’s brewery, which operates more than 200 pubs around the country. Its shares have soared in value from 115p in 1995 to 1615p today.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Train says: ‘As long as you expect London to remain a growing city and you expect Londoners to carry on drinking alcoholic beverages, Young’s is a good company share to buy and hold.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He has also owned shares in Irn-Bru maker AG Barr for 17 years – Irn-Bru is still the number one soft drink in Scotland.</p><div>

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Train says drinks brands make great investments because the cost of ingredients is low and consumer loyalty is high.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He adds: ‘AG Barr has recently cut the sugar content of Irn-Bru so there is no excuse not to keep supping the nectar. We will see what that does for the price of the shares over the next 17 years.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finding winning shares by yourself can be tricky but investors can back those fund managers such as Train who have a strong track record of being able to root them out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Laith Khalaf is senior analyst at financial broker Hargreaves Lansdown. He says: ‘The best strategy for building your wealth is to get rich slowly by buying and holding investment funds over the long term.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Picking a fund manager who uses a buy and hold approach means their skill in picking long term winners benefits you directly.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The most extreme example of this is an investment in the first ever investment trust, Foreign &amp; Colonial, which launched 150 years ago in 1868. If you had put just £100 into the trust at launch you would now have an investment worth an incredible £12 million.</p><img id="i-8c5af645a43d4d43" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/13/4C6BAFA300000578-5747953-image-m-6_1526734538665.jpg" height="432" width="306" alt="Tasty tip: Regular drinkers boost Young’s brewery success" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">While investing for 150 years is not realistic, backing an investment fund for ten, 20 or even 30 years is practical, particularly if you are investing into a pension for retirement. Investors should find an investment fund with a strong track record, with a manager whose style they like, invest and then leave their money alone for at least five years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The longer you leave your money the greater the potential investment returns. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Such an approach is not only cheaper but is usually effective because it means you are not tempted to change your investments at the worst time. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rob Pemberton is investment director at financial adviser HFM Columbus Partners in Weybridge, Surrey. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says: ‘The best advice when it comes to investing is to forget about the short-term and not get distracted by so-called “market noise”. This can cause you to chop and change and make poor decisions influenced by fear and greed, rather than sound logical analysis.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Terry Smith is another fund manager renowned for rarely buying or selling shares. He says: ‘Our strategy is to invest in good companies, try not to overpay for the shares and then simply do nothing but hold.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His £13 billion Fundsmith Equity fund only invests in 29 companies and 12 of these have not changed since the fund launched in 2010. They include Milkybar maker Nestlé, Guinness-brewer Diageo and toothpaste maker Colgate-Palmolive. Over the past five years, a £1,000 investment would have grown to £2,250.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some investment trusts take the buy and hold approach to extreme. Bankers Investment Trust has owned shares in UK bank HSBC for a staggering 129 years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first set of annual accounts from the trust in 1889 show the bank’s shares listed as well as those of companies including Liebig’s Extract of Meat Co, which used to be the owner of Oxo cubes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Investment trust Lowland has invested in Wiltshire-based pub company Wadworth since 1968. James Henderson, who manages the trust, says the value of the holding has increased 100 times not including dividend payments along the way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, there are more than 20 companies in the JPMorgan American investment trust which have been in the portfolio for a decade or more, including tech giants Microsoft and Apple.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Manager Garrett Fish says: ‘Apple has been at the forefront of innovation over the past decade and disrupted an entire industry through the introduction of products such as the iPod and iPad.’</p><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The investment guru famously said that the ideal length of time to hold an investment is ‘for ever’.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The 5 April Isa deadline is fast approaching, meaning time is almost up for investors to make the most of this year's bumper £20,000 tax-free Isa allowance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are still wondering where to invest, it might be worth giving passive funds a second look.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In their purest form passive funds, also referred to as trackers, attempt to replicate the performance of a given index such as the S&amp;P 500.</p><img id="i-f17fa751e49464be" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/22/15/4A71F26A00000578-5531213-image-a-6_1521733714662.jpg" height="458" width="634" alt="Funds invested in passive products rose by 38 per cent in 2017 from the year before " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">They seldom achieve this due to a phenomenon called <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/indexinvesting/article-5316649/How-distinguish-two-ETFs-track-index.html">tracking error</a> but the divergence is typically small.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trackers have gained popularity in recent years.

</div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The allure of such investments is easy to understand. For one, they typically cost less than actively managed propositions. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Active managers earn their corn by attempting to beat their benchmark market index by cherry-picking stocks and chopping and changing them to take advantage of perceived inefficiencies in the market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, trying to beat the index  comes at a cost. Cash spent on the latest investment research and footing the salaries of the investment team - fund manager included - inflate the cost of active management.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This extra cost layer does not apply to passive propositions, which are essentially run by a computer algorithm and will buy all or the majority of the assets within the index they track.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What's more, with active investments, there is no guarantee that they will perform better than the market. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, a school of thought argues that the odds are stacked against actives over the long-run as market indices tend to be more broadly diversified and are therefore better shielded against economic cycles.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Put simply, you can pay more for an active which may or may not beat the market or you can pay less for a tracker which won't beat the market but should match it. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But with so many options on offer, how do you choose the best trackers to invest in this Isa season? We've asked two experts in passive investments to give their top picks.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">The experts' top picks </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Peter Sleep, senior investment manager at Seven Investment Management</strong>, said investors should always aim put their cash in regulated 'UCITS' funds - which have stringent safeguards for investors in place. He outlined his top picks below.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>UK Equity - </strong></strong><strong><strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="https://www.lyxoretf.lu/en/instit/resources/documents/factsheets/rfact_lu1781541096_en_20180309_lux">Lyxor Core Morningstar UK ETF</a></strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><strong>Ongoing charges: 0.04 per cent</strong><strong></strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Lyxor Core Morningstar UK ETF is a new fund which  launched this month. It costs 0.04 per cent, which is as cheap as chips.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A broad-based UK equity fund is the core building block for any investor. The ETF has 337 stocks and  a good combination of large international companies and smaller UK-orientated companies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>UK Equity Income - </strong></strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://webfund6.financialexpress.net/clients/dailymail/FundFactsheet.aspx?CitiCode=FPC7"><strong><strong>Vanguard UK Equity Income</strong></strong></a></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ongoing charges: 0.22 per cent</strong></p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I'm a fan of the Vanguard UK Equity Income Fund priced at 0.22 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is a tracker fund rather than an ETF, although they are very, very similar. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some caution is needed with UK equity income funds because you can end up biased towards quite volatile stocks. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Vanguard fund is nicely balanced and has a decent yield of about 4.9 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Global Equity - <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://webfund6.financialexpress.net/clients/dailymail/FundFactsheet.aspx?CitiCode=K41J">Vanguard Global Small-Cap Index</a></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ongoing charges: 0.40 per cent</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Again another tracker fund from Vanguard. The Global Small-cap Index fund priced at 0.38 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This invests in over 4,300 smaller companies from around the developed world. Historically smaller companies grow faster and show better returns than larger companies that may often have grown to their limit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ethical ETF - </strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://webfund6.financialexpress.net/clients/dailymail/FundFactsheet.aspx?CitiCode=OCQH"><strong><strong>UBS ETF MSCI ACWI Socially Responsible UCITS ETF</strong></strong></a></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ongoing charges: 0.48 per cent</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is an increasing number of ethical ETFs, but I am going to go for UBS ETF MSCI ACWI Socially Responsible UCITS ETF. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is an 'all countries' ETF, so it covers both 47 developed markets and emerging markets, but not frontier markets (defined as smaller illiquid stock markets where investor protections are poor). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This ETF scores every company on various ethical, social and governance standards and then kicks out sectors with a negative social or environmental impact like gambling or alcohol. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ETF costs 0.48 per cent. To reduce the risk of investing abroad this ETF is hedged into sterling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Bond ETF: </strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPFB:GR"><strong><strong>SPDR Barclays Global Aggregate Bond UCITS ETF</strong></strong></a></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ongoing charges: 0.10 per cent</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The SPDR Barclays Global Aggregate Bond UCITS ETF  GBP hedged costs 0.1 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the long-term, the king of investments is equities, but we know they can be very volatile and they are not for everyone, so more cautious investors hold bonds and accept a lower return for a less bumpy investment ride.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This ETF invests in high grade government and corporate bonds, what we call 'supranationals', like the World Bank, and high-grade emerging market bonds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finally it is all hedged into  sterling to reduce risk further.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You get all that for the bargain basement price of 0.1 per cent. With 21,000 bonds in the index the ETF is highly diversified and SPDR have to work really hard for you.</p><div class="moduleFull"><div class="money item">

Start now</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the last few years we have seen allowances dramatically increased. There is, however, no knowing how long that trend will continue. It means it’s worth using as much of your allowances as you can afford each year, to take advantage while the Isa sun shines.  </p><img id="i-f8dccbcfa9b2d0c7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/21/13/1D29AA7C00000578-5455169-image-a-2_1521637400083.jpg" height="395" width="306" alt="Keep your eyes on the investing prize to become an Isa millionaire" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold">2. Use as much of your allowances as possible</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you had invested your full allowance into a personal equity plan [now defunct] and then Isas each year, you could have put away more than quarter of a million pounds in contributions. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, if you were at least 50 in 2009/10, you could have contributed a total of £262,760 if you’d maxed out your contributions since 1987.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the last few years we have seen allowances dramatically increased. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is, however, no knowing how long that trend will continue. It means it’s worth using as much of your allowances as you can afford each year, to take advantage while the Isa sun shines.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold">3. Reinvest dividends</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This has a profound effect on overall returns, because you are compounding the growth on your assets. If you are investing in companies that aim to grow the dividend, you will effectively magnify that growth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold">4. Take enough risk</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If are putting money aside for the long term of ten years or more, your money has a far better chance of growth in the stockmarkets than in a cash Isa, although your capital will be at risk. You can also increase the potential upside by considering more adventurous assets for your portfolio.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-0e811c60-2b84-11e8-8fae-6f3a12b7aba8">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">What you need to know about Isas</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s not long before the door slams shut on your chance to use this year’s Isa allowance. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, listen to our special Isa podcast – with a comfortable (almost) three weeks to spare before the 5 April tax year-end.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We tackle the basics and have tips for those who are experienced Isa savers or investors.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We also look at why investing is the best way to get inflation-beating returns over the long-term, how savers can eke some precious extra interest from accounts, and why an Isa is worth having.</p><div class="mol-html" id="mol-0e822dd0-2b84-11e8-8fae-6f3a12b7aba8">                            <div><iframe width="100%" height="300" style="background-color:transparent; display:block; padding: 0; max-width: 700px;" src="//embeds.audioboom.com/posts/6728529-everything-you-need-to-know-about-isas/embed/v4?eid=AQAAAAv-q1pRq2YA" title="Audioboom player"></iframe></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> Press play to listen to the show above, or listen (and please subscribe if you like the podcast) at <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/this-is-money-show/id979600898?mt=2">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.acast.com/thisismoneyshow">Acast</a> and <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://audioboom.com/channel/thisismoney">Audioboom</a> or visit our <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/podcast/index.html">This is Money Podcast page</a>.  </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold">5. Exploit the globe</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One way to expose your portfolio to more potential growth is by investing some of it in emerging markets. These are generally riskier investments than those in more developed countries, but in return they can tap into economies with the potential for faster growth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold">6. Don’t go overboard</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you take big positions in risky stocks or other assets, you need to be prepared for the potential losses as well as the possibility of gains. Adventurous assets should only be used in a way that suits your overall attitude to risk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold">7. Use an expert</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are Isa millionaires who are individual stockpickers, but most people prefer to use the expertise of a fund manager. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While tracker funds are an excellent way to get started with the stockmarket, many of these more experienced investors, with much larger portfolios, have selected a recommended manager who runs a relatively concentrated portfolio. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That way they have the potential to amplify growth, without necessarily having to become an expert in those stocks themselves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold">8. Don’t chop and change too much</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Investing is a long term process, and while it’s important to keep an eye on performance to ensure it is meeting expectations, it’s also vital to take the long view. Switching investments in an effort to time the markets will bring higher transaction costs and may mean you miss out on the long term growth story of a fund or share.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold">9. Stick out the tough times</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Building a large and successful portfolio is about time in the markets rather than timing the market, so when things are more difficult, the key is to buy rather than sell.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold">10. Don’t forget the rest of the family</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In addition to your own Isa, you should also make sure your spouse is using theirs, and that you have put money into Jisas for any children. A family of four can shelter £48,256 in the current tax year by using their allowances. </p><div class="moduleFull"></div><img id="i-ecc13df9b2421ea7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/22/14/0165C51E000004B0-5455169-image-a-1_1521730050370.jpg" height="449" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" />]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>DIY investing giant Hargreaves Lansdown has put together a list of the 10 most popular shares and top 10 funds among the 168 Isa millionaires who invest with it.

They are structured like a company, with shares that trade on the stock market and invest in a basket of shares, bonds or property. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are known as closed-ended as the number of shares or units trading in the trust  is limited and finite.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Investment trusts can be riskier than unit trusts because their shares can trade at a premium or discount to the value of the assets they hold, known as the net asset value. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unlike closed ended-funds - also sometimes called unit trusts - investment trusts are also allowed to raise debt in order to fund investment. This means when markets perform well their investment returns are geared and can outperform the market. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It also exposes investors to risk however, as debt-funded investment can result in bigger losses if markets fall. </p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trusts have won plaudits among many investors over their performance. In the 11 months to the end of November 2017, the share price of the average investment company grew 14 per cent, according to the Association of Investment Companies figures.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In addition, fees for investment trusts tend to be lower than funds, which means your returns are not as affected by charges. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What's more, as trusts are  closed ended, meaning there is a fixed amount of shares, unlike in a fund where you risk having your returns diluted if more people invest or if a whole load of people try to sell out their holding.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But with more than 300 investment companies to choose from, it is difficult to whittle the options down to those  best suited to you.

It’s no more complicated than Dragon’s Den – fund managers try and pick companies which they think will grow, make money and turn decent profits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shares are the most volatile type of mainstream investment and can jump up and down in value a lot. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bonds (basically IOUs from Governments and companies which pay investors some income for their loans) are typically the more bland investment cousin and can be used by investors to turn the rollercoaster into a more sedate ride.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’re investing for the very long-term you may want to only choose shares.

If you make purchases abroad the fee is 2.75 per cent (minimum £1.50).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The bank does also offer a credit card which affords fee-free spending. This works within the same app and charges interest at 9.9 per cent. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You still want to avoid cash withdrawals on the card as this incurs a 3 per cent with a minimum of £3.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Overdraft costs </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its borrowing charges are slightly more complicated than Starling and Monzo.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any planned borrowing will cost £6 per month plus 12.5 EAR per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One useful feature, B offers a two-day grace period for you to avoid charges and there is a £25 fee-free buffer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You will need to watch out for unplanned borrowing as that will clock up hefty bills.

Bank transfer tends to be the cheaper method.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, Coinbase charges 3.99 per cent on debit and credit transactions, or 1.49 per cent for a standard buy/sell.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many have strict requirements for ID purposes. A handy website is Bittybot, which lets you compare brokers and fees, alongside user ratings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Two of the most popular brokers are Coinify and Coinbase, mentioned above. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, a firm called London Block Exchange, based in Canary Wharf, is soon to launch, allowing people to buy and spend five online currencies - bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, monero and ripple - which will be linked to a Visa debit card.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you buy bitcoin, for example, you will need to hand over your unique key. This is an identifier that represents your account and is different from your wallet log-in. It should be easy to find within the details of your account.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brokers will ask for this address to make a transaction. When it comes to selling, there should be no issue selling a mainstream coin such as bitcoin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can use the same broker you bought it from and it will involve them giving you an other key to send your bitcoin too from your wallet. Once the transaction is confirmed, you should receive your cash. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remember, some of these exchanges can crash unexpectedly. For instance, Kraken, the fifth largest cryptocurrency exchange, was out of service for two days earlier in the month after scheduled maintenance that was supposed to take two hours. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It left many nervy investors wondering if they'd be able to cash out, if they so wished. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is also possible to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through some existing trading platforms, where you actually own the coins themselves. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One popular website which advertises heavily is eToro. We've seen adverts on the London Underground and even on easyJet flight boarding passes. Its system works similar to a DIY investing platform's nominee account system, eToro holds the cryptocurrencies and you have a claim on those that you have bought. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Previously the platform used contracts for difference for crypto, but it no longer does. </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-926e3a90-01c6-11e8-ac74-d33834489f7b">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">I BOUGHT €4K OF RIPPLE ON BITSTAMP</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">One This is Money reader, Alex – who only wants his first name mentioned – invested €1,600 in ripple last June, a further €1,600  at the start of December and a further €1,000 over Christmas.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He chose ripple after a friend-of-a-friend recommendation from an IT consultant with a keen interest in cryptocurrencies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says that they had used an exchange called Gatehub. However, Alex says when he went to invest, the website was sticky and slow.</p><img id="i-e97fe5b1e277accf" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/25/13/48927CC900000578-5311243-image-a-3_1516886208900.jpg" height="391" width="586" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">After some research and a raft of good reviews, he plumped for Bitstamp. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the time of his investment, ripple was not really heard of, with only bitcoin and ethereum really in the mainstream domain, making it harder to get hold of.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, it took some hoops to get involved. It took a week to get verified, which involved him sending a copy of passport to the Bitstamp HQ in Slovenia, along with a bank transfer, which meant having his Iban and Swift Code to hand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says that recently, a friend of his has also tried to sign up with Bitstamp, but the company is quoting five weeks to verify, thanks to a surge of interest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says his June investment saw ripple at $0.22 a coin, but this fell to $0.10 not long afterwards, testing his nerve at the very beginning.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eventually it rose and he was confident to make another investment, in December, when the coin went to $0.38 a coin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By mid-January, it raced to a record high near $4 a coin – and Alex said his account had grown to €34,000 (it's measured in euros as it is Slovenian based) from roughly €4,000 invested.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said on one train journey home, his account had collapsed from €34,000 to €25,000, as investors began to panic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He believes the price went up after rumours that ripple was heading to Coinbase, one of the main crypto players, meaning more people could invest, thus driving up the price.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the firm issued a statement saying this wasn't the case - and it lead to a bloodbath.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, was it easy to cash out? Alex says it was. He sold 8,000XRP making a tidy profit and taking away his exposure. This was sold within seconds on the site to eager investors.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has left him with 12,000XRP that he plans to keep hold of. Currently, it has 'stabilised' to around $1.15 a coin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says Bitstamp charge 0.24 per cent for buying and selling. The cost, he says, of selling, was €9 in fees. It was also warned that it would take up to three working days to arrive in his account. It took two.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We asked whether his bank had been in touch regarding any suspicious activity, giving the amounts of money being transferred and having been received overseas. He says he hasn't.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A raft of case studies recently in the <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ft.com/content/cd13cdce-fa12-11e7-9b32-d7d59aace167">Financial Times</a> revealed problems cashing out their profits, with some banks suspicious of where customers had received huge sums. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Transferring cash and passport details to Slovenia for an investment punt is extreme - but Alex says the risk has paid dividends.</p>                            </div>                        </div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">CFDS</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some websites offer investors the chance to take a punt on cryptocurrencies, but not actually own any of their own. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, you buy 'Contract For Difference' agreements. This is where an investor and a broker agree to pay each other the difference between the price of an asset at the moment the contract is made and its later price when you decide to close it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Financial Conduct Authority warned against betting on the currency using CFDs in November.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are complex financial instruments which allow novice investors to guess whether the price will go up or down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Punters could lose up to 50 times their deposit if they get it wrong, meaning they could rapidly rack up huge debts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The FCA said CFD traders are 'at risk of suffering significant losses and potentially losing more than you have invested'. </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">OBSCURE COINS HARDER TO BUY</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many may believe bitcoin may have peaked – or reached a point in which they cannot make some of the astronomical gains made by early investors.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As such, they want to take a 'punt' on a lesser known coin. There is plenty of them. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is Money recently signed up to New Zealand based website Cryptopia to see a list of what is available. It was huge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Two that are being tipped to grow this year from a low level by a panel of four fintech leaders for price comparison website Finder in a cryptocurrency predictions survey are cardano (ADA) and stellar lumens (XLM).</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">They claim that cardano – a third generation digital currency - will rise by more than 8,000 per cent this year from $0.78 a coin to $68.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, getting your mitts on the coin as a speculative punt is not as easy as it seems. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hardly any of the aforementioned brokers or wallets cater for the smaller currencies, only the main players such as bitcoin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You then find yourself on niche websites – or in our case, Cryptopia. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But to buy any currency on many of these types of website requires you to already own bitcoin or another major cryptocurrency. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Or in Alex's case above, sending bank and passport details to Slovenia, which is a hurdle many - understandably - would not be comfortable with.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When we searched 'how to buy cardano UK' a step-by-step guide said we needed to download software for the wallet and own ethereum to get the coin. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We're not sure how many people would be comfortable downloading software onto their computers or phones from sources they do not know. It is open to all sorts of fraudulent activity. </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">DO YOU DECLARE PROFITS TO THE TAXMAN? </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those who have made profits from buying and selling digital currencies may be left a little confused about whether or not they need to pay tax.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With the deadline for tax returns fast approaching, many may not know whether or not to declare it - and the HMRC guidelines are a little fuzzy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The last time it issued guidance on the taxation of cryptocurrencies was March 2014, which feels like a lifetime ago in the world of fast moving digital currencies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So is it an investment meaning Capital Gains Tax is payable on gains above £11,300? This is 18 per cent for basic-rate income tax payers and 28 per cent for  higher-rate taxpayers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Or should it be treated as gambling, which means profits are tax-free?  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An HMRC spokesman says: 'We don't normally tax betting and gambling because it is usually not classed as trading income. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But there may be circumstances where factors such as the degree of skill and organisation would make the activity more likely to be taxable as trading income.

Returns have been bolstered by the fall in the pound's value.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But those gains have been achieved through a long bull market that has seen the US stock market chased up to high levels of valuation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Investors must ask themselves, will the outperformance continue if the US market hits bumpy times?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ben Yearsley, director at Shore Financial Planning, said the US is not only a big portion of the fund but of global stock markets also - it makes up 60 per cent of the MSCI World index.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-419929b0-ff76-11e7-9e00-1d0aa156a3c7">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox">The good thing about buying long-term winners is it is quite likely that those companies will still be around and growing in 10 or even 20 years' time </div>                        <div class="mol-article-quote-attribution"><div>Ben Yearsley, Shore Financial Planning </div></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If the US markets catch a cold most markets will,' Yearsley said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The good thing about buying long-term winners is it is quite likely that those companies will still be around and growing in 10 or even 20 years' time. Therefore the problem with buying them is more about timing and price. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Which leads me to the problem with the fund. It is packed with excellent long-term companies but you are being made to pay a high price for them currently. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When you have scarce global growth, companies growing at even 2 per cent each year consistently are in demand.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ultimately, Fundsmith's approach in buying and holding such companies long-term reflects that of Buffett and another very successful UK fund manager dubbed Buffett-esque, Nick Train, who runs <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://webfund6.financialexpress.net/clients/dailymail/FundFactsheet.aspx?CitiCode=FD89&amp;Univ=InvestmentTrusts">Finsbury Growth &amp; Income</a> and the <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://webfund6.financialexpress.net/clients/dailymail/FundFactsheet.aspx?CitiCode=K4VD&amp;Univ=UnitTrusts">Lindsell Train UK Equity</a> and <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://webfund6.financialexpress.net/clients/dailymail/FundFactsheet.aspx?CitiCode=K6WV&amp;Univ=UnitTrusts">Global Equity</a> funds (the latter with Michael Lindsell).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All three have emerged from the school of <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="" href="/money/diyinvesting/article-4949092/Is-time-profit-value-investing.html">value investing</a>, but have no problem in holding companies that trade at relatively high price-to-earnings ratios compared to the market average. Their argument is that there is a limited number of  great businesses in the world and although sometimes you have to pay a higher price for them that may still be a good deal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like Train's investment trust and funds, Fundsmith has now built up a healthy track record of returns for investors. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, when choosing an investment past performance is only one part of the equation. The calibre of those who have been given the reins to manage the fund should be a major factor in your decision. For now, investors seem to think Terry Smith passes that test.</p><div class="moduleFull"><div class="money item">

</div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Why have they been scrapped?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nearly two years ago, an EU-wide cap on interchange fees came into force. This limited the amount credit card companies can charge shops and merchants to process a transaction at 0.3 per cent. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rob Burgess, editor of Head for Points, explains: 'New rules brought in last year restricted the fee that payment processors could charge retailers for accepting credit cards to 0.3 per cent. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It is very difficult to run a successful mileage card on this basis – if you earn 0.3p per £1 spent, you cannot pay an airline 0.5p to 1p per £1 to buy the cardholder an air mile.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘While the cap initially only related to MasterCard and Visa, now American Express' cards offered in partnership with another bank or lender - such as MBNA - also fall under the same rules.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">American Express' co-branded cards - those it issues itself  in partnership with another business, such as Lloyds - are also being reviewed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Burgess says: 'The way the law is written means that co-brand cards are seen as bringing in a fourth party. The British Airways American Express is seen as a four-way venture between American Express, British Airways, the shop and the cardholder. Four parties means it must cap its fees at 0.3 per cent.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This obviously makes no sense at all, even inside the card industry itself, but unless the final EU court ruling goes against the Advocate General's initial opinion (which is rare) the decision will be binding.'</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-28c2bdf0-d421-11e7-a43f-015a16d8134d">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title"><span class="mol-style-small">What about existing MBNA customers?</span></h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have one of the eight MBNA airline rewards cards that have been axed, there's nothing to worry about at the moment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An MBNA spokesperson said: ‘For existing customers, nothing changes for now – they can still earn miles and we will continue to provide exactly the same service. All miles will still be available for redemption under the terms and conditions of the appropriate frequent flyer programme.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Typically when cards are withdrawn from general sale on the market customers won’t be affected for a little while, but it’s likely that at some point in the future you will be switched to an alternative card.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rob Burgess, of Head for Points, says: ‘MBNA's contract may allow it to forcibly move cardholders onto a different MBNA own-brand card. This is what happened when Barclays lost the licence to issue IHG Rewards Club (Holiday Inn etc loyalty scheme) cards two years ago - people were sent a Barclays cashback card instead. It is also what MBNA did when it closed the British Midland credit cards after BA bought the airline.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Some contracts may not allow MBNA to do this. Those cards will be closed at some point (could be weeks, could be months) and customers given the option of moving to another MBNA card, but MBNA won't be allowed to send an unsolicited card.’ </p>                            </div>                        </div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Airline cards still available </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Lloyds Avios Rewards</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Currently, you can still open a <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.lloydsbank.com/credit-cards/avios-rewards.asp">Lloyds Bank Avios Rewards credit card </a>that comes with two cards, one American Express and one MasterCard. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In return for the £24 annual fee, you can earn 1.25 Avios for every £1 spent on the Amex and for every full £5 spent on the MasterCard.

Here's how they compare.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-28f9fb60-c54b-11e7-8446-e978840acc19">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU BUY</h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While mobile card readers are clever tool, the trade-off is they often charge higher fees than dedicated payment processing companies, and not all merchants accept payments over the phone and online.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They also rely on Wifi or mobile phone reception to work so if you're trading out in the sticks or anywhere else with a limited signal, you'll need to ensure you have an ample cash stockpile for when coverage is patchy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Featured on our list of the best card readers are <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="http://izettle.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=6&amp;aff_id=23653">iZettle</a>, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/credit-card-reader">PayPal Here</a>, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="https://squareup.com/t/f_content/p_mailonline/l_gb?route=signup/gb%3Fsignup_token%3D2E5D68CD">Square</a> and <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="https://sumup.com/#a_aid=5a00950b2b5e4">Sum Up Air</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Users of these devices aren't required to sign a contract, so they can use them for as long or short a period as they like.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The card readers also allow merchants to send receipts via email or SMS but receipt printers are extra. So if your customer doesn't have an email address or mobile number, or if you don't fancy shelling out on a compatible printer (which can cost north of £100), the only option you're left with is writing one by hand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What's more, they all offer an accompanying point of sale app allowing you to track real-time sales data, for example, at no extra cost - although some are more elaborate than others. SumUp Air for example offers a basic point of sale app as standard but users can upgrade to a 'complete' solution which provides a re-configured iPad, an iPad stand, a receipt printer, a cash drawer and a Wi-Fi router. This, however, will incur a fixed monthly cost.</p></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>This list is in no particular order<span style="font-size: 22.4px; letter-spacing: -0.224px;">.

In addition, while PayPal can credit funds to your PayPal account instantly, there can be restrictions on accessing these funds depending on your business and its activities. This could cause cashflow problems. It also does not accept as many cards as the others - but as with all of the readers included in the top four, it accepts Visa, MasterCard and Amex.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-53eae7a0-c562-11e7-8446-e978840acc19">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">WHY I USE PAYPAL HERE </h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><img id="i-8127f6aa7cdf253c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/08/17/4623A6D400000578-5035977-image-a-4_1510160818050.jpg" height="379" width="284" alt="Gareth Walton of campervan accessories firm OLPRO uses the PayPal Here card reader at roadshows" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Gareth Walton, 38, is the operations manager at campervan accessories firm OLPRO</strong>.

PayPal Here is the most expensive overall.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While all four featured readers have no fixed contract or monthly fees and no required transaction volumes, the transaction fees range from 1.69 per cent to 2.75 per cent. The figures are even higher for payments where the card is not present.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, the device cost is between £39 plus VAT for Square and £62.50 plus VAT for PayPal Here (once the iZettle and PayPal Here promotions expire at the end of November).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That said, cost isn't everything. It is important to look under the bonnet of each proposition to find out whether they align to the needs of your business.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All four devices accept Visa, MasterCard and Amex cards but it is worth double checking if there are other card types you think you need to accept, according to Stephen Hart from Cardswitcher.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You also need to check if the device is compatible with your smartphone/tablet, and, crucially, how long it takes before the card payments you take will be transferred into your accounts. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Emma Jones from Enterprise Nation says: 'In the early days of card readers, the money took many days or even a week to trickle into you bank account. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Today there is no need to wait more than a day, two tops. This is also helpful for cash flow. It also saves you having to take a lot of cash home with you and then count it into bundles and bags and take it to the bank when it opens the next day.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In addition, it is probably worth paying that little bit extra on a device that not only facilitates card payments but boasts features that can help drive up sales.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hart adds: 'The biggest difference between devices is probably the reporting/ analytics tools on offer to help you run your business - these are now very sophisticated but do vary so check what's on offer from each for your business needs. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'All the websites have great videos showcasing their functionality. Finally, there's integration - some devices seamlessly integrate with popular accounting packages such as <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.xero.com/uk/?utm_source=Affiliate&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=spreadsheets">Xero</a>.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-large"><strong>Traditional card terminals could still be the best solution </strong> </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While mobile card readers have been a positive addition to the payment options available to merchants, traditional terminals should not be overlooked.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes devices are still pretty pricey.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">This affects up to 10,000 cars used each day in the capital, according to Transport for London. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That means it could generate up to £215,000 a day that, by law, has to be reinvested into London's transport network. That works out at more than £1.5 million a week, £6million a month and over £78 million a year. </p><img id="i-967743b8ea1b8a38" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/10/13/10/00A3AFFE1000044C-4970854-image-a-68_1507885293472.jpg" height="334" width="634" alt="The T-Charge is applicable to cars that are not Euro 4 compliant while driving in the existing Congestion Zone" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-a4c4f6c2050d3297" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/10/12/17/45449A9300000578-4970854-image-a-66_1507826821015.jpg" height="456" width="634" alt="This Transport for London map shows the Congestion Zone outer limit for those wanting to avoid having to pay extra to drive in Central London" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Where does the T-Charge apply?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The T-Charge is applicable to any car that drives into the existing Congestion Zone, which covers central London inside the city's inner ring road that captures the City and West End. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The zone is easy to identify by road markings and signs instructing drivers that they are about to enter the chargeable zones. </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">When does the T-Charge apply?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Consistent with the Congestion Charge, the London T-Charge will be enforceable from Monday to Friday between the hours of 7am and 6pm. </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">How will I know if my car pays the T-Charge?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">As previously stated, only cars that fail to meet Euro 4 emissions standards are subject to having to pay the T-Charge. Broadly speaking this covers all diesel and petrol cars built before the end of 2004. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, if you own a car that is registered in 2005, it could still be eligible for the T-Charge. Any car registered from January 1 2006 is definitely exempt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It also applies to quadricycles and tricycles, but only those that pre-date Euro 3 emissions standard. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Motorcycles are exempt while buses, coaches and HGVs have to meet stricter Euro 6 emissions standard that were introduced just three years ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Confused by it all? Fortunately, there's an easy way to check if your vehicle is exempt or not. TfL launched a '<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/emissions-surcharge/emissions-surcharge-checker">T-Charge checker</a>' at the same time it confirmed the tariff in February. Simply enter the registration number of your car and it will tell you if you'll have to cough up the £10 fee.  </p><img id="i-d04f7197ff4463e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/10/12/17/45449A9700000578-4970854-image-a-67_1507826829188.jpg" height="535" width="634" alt="Here's a run down of which vehicles fall into the T-Charge tariff and how much drivers/riders will have to pay" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Will it cost me more if I pay the day after driving into the congestion zone?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Currently, motorists can pay the standard-rate congestion charge of £11.50 on the day they have driven into the zone or pay the following day, though at an increased charge of £14.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">TfL confirmed to This is Money that a similar methodology will not be used for the T-Charge and the £10 flat rate will be applied on both the day of and day after entering the chargeable zone. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It means the maximum combined fee will be £24, if you pay you congestion zone and T-Charge fee the day after entry. </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">I drive a classic car. Is it exempt from the T-Charge?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any car that qualifies for a historic tax class (any model that's 40 years or older) is exempt from the T-Charge but will still have to pay £11.50 for the Congestion Charge if driven into one of the zones.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other exemptions include emergency services vehicles, NHS and Minstry of Defence vehicles, roadside recovery vehicles and specialist off-road vehicles such as tractors or cranes. </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">I live in the Congestion Zone  - do I get a discount on the T-Charge?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Residents within the Congestion Zone with vehicles that fail to meet the emissions standard to escape paying the T-Charge will get a 90 per cent discount.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those who are registered for the Congestion Charge Residents' Discount will automatically receive the reduced rate that will see them paying £2.05 a day - £1 for the T-Charge and £1.05 for the Congestion Charge during their active hours.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unused parked vehicles using on-street parking bays and displaying a valid resident's parking permit will not be charged for that day.</p><img id="i-c573f6204291e198" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/10/13/10/4549F85A00000578-4970854-image-a-71_1507887098464.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Blue badge holders will get a 100% T-Charge discount but will need to be registered for the Congestion Charge discount to escape having to pay" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">I have a disabled blue badge? What T-Charge discount do I get? </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Blue Badge holders will be eligible for a 100 per cent discount on the T-Charge - they just need to be registered for the Congestion Charge discount for this to happen. </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">How do I pay the T-Charge?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The T-Charge will be paid along with the Congestion Charge on a <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/paying-the-congestion-charge-select-vehicle-26283">dedicated page on TfL's website</a>. You will also be able to pay over the phone by calling 0343 222 2222 or set up an Auto Pay system if you're regularly driving into the congestion zone. </p><img id="i-1ac61582ed1d4e1a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/10/13/10/062555A30000044D-4970854-image-a-70_1507885324219.jpg" height="459" width="306" alt="ANPR cameras at each Congestion Zone entry point will detect if you need to hand over some cash to Transport for London" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">What happens if I don't pay the T-Charge?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Failure to pay for the T-Charge will result in a fine of £135, though that will be reduced to £65 if paid within 14 days - as with a Penalty Charge Notice for parking illegally.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How will TfL know you're entering a zone? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras in the congestion zone will be able to track your vehicle, so there's no way of avoiding payment.  </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Is there a way I can avoid the T-Charge?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don't drive into central London is the short answer, but beyond that you will need to buy a newer compliant vehicle. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other than buying a new car that is exempt from the tariff the only other option you have if you must drive into central London is to park outside the Congestion Zone and use public transport.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An electric car, which emits nothing at all when being driven, will always be exempt from the T-Charge, so it might be worth buying one if you're going to be paying regularly. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Electric cars tend to lose three quarters of their value after three years, so you can pick up cheap options on the second-hand market.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Is the T-Charge likely to penalise newer cars in the future?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">No. A spokesperson for TfL told us that the current T-Charge restrictions would remain the same until the Ultra Low Emissions Zone is introduced in its place in 2019.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That means the T-Charge will only apply to pre-Euro 4 petrol and diesel cars while it is enforceable. </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">What's next for the clampdown on vehicle emissions in London?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The next phase of restricting vehicle use in the capital will be the Ultra Low Emissions Zone, which is due to be enforced in two year's time and will replace the T-Charge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stricter rules will mean pre-Euro 4 petrols will still have to pay when driving in these zones, while much newer pre-Euro 6 diesels will be hit too. That means diesel cars registered before September 2015 will have to pay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it might not only be enforceable in central London. Sadiq Khan has already suggested the 2019 charging net could be cast further across the capital than the current Congestion Zone and T-Charge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From 8 April 2019 ULEZ will be enforced in central London, but from 2021 the suggestion has been put forward of extending it all the way to the North and South Circular roads.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whether this proposal happens or not remains to be seen. While the Congestion Charge zone covers only the centre of London, the ring of the North and South Circular includes a substantial swathe of residential areas, where a backlash against charging for older cars would be likely to be huge.</p><img id="i-c7e6111368d83c17" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/10/13/10/158AAC1300000514-4970854-image-a-87_1507887691411.jpg" height="650" width="634" alt="Sadiq Khan's crackdown on vehicle use in the city is aimed at reducing the illegal levels of air pollution in the capital and encourage Londoners to walk and cycle more frequently" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-8c782d60-b7d6-11e7-b309-6502cd11c371">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">What's been said about the introduction of the  T-Charge?</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Speaking on the day of the T-Charge launch, Leonie Cooper AM, chair of the <strong>Environment Committee</strong>, said she was happy to see the introduction of the tariff and called for the government to do more to persuade drivers to swap their high-polluting diesels for more efficient models.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We absolutely must do more to prevent premature deaths and stunting children's lungs from air pollution – so we welcome the Mayor’s T-Charge as a first step towards making London’s air less toxic,' she said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'However, the London Assembly Environment Committee believes even greater results could be achieved if the measures were implemented at a faster pace.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The Ultra-Low Emission Zone will take effect in 2019 and exemption from that will require the Euro 6 standard for diesels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Raising awareness of this and discouraging the use of diesel vehicles in favour of much cleaner alternatives, should be top of the agenda. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So should complementary measures to help shift the transportation habits of Londoners towards cheaper alternatives such as buses or trains and healthier options such as walking and cycling. ‎</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We'd also like the government to step up and introduce a diesel <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="" href="/money/cars/article-4833864/Car-scrappage-schemes-explained-compared.html">scrappage scheme</a> to help move things forward quickly.'  </p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>RAC </strong>roads policy spokesman Nick Lyes said something needed to be done to improve air quality in the capital but feared that those with lower-income backgrounds will be hardest hit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: 'There is little doubt that we need to clean up London’s air and the Mayor is right to look at the oldest vehicles because these are more likely to be the most polluting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">“However, the T-Charge has had a quick implementation since it was first announced a year ago, and those drivers likely to be most impacted are those from lower income backgrounds as well as smaller, possibly struggling businesses who have had neither the time nor the resources to replace their vehicles quickly. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Drivers may also see themselves as an easy target – while some car emissions are a contributory factor to poor air quality, the Mayor needs to look at other sectors such as industry, domestic boilers and even his own bus fleet where he should be accelerating transition to zero emission as soon as possible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Debate will also be raised over whether a flat fee will make much of a difference.

The best way to minimise that risk is to spread your money in a number of funds.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Known as diversification, the idea is your money is spread across different funds that invest in different sectors, companies and commodities whose value should not all rise or fall at once. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Pemberton adds: ‘Investors should remember that, typically, the higher the income, the higher the risk. I would consider anything yielding more than 5pc to be very risky for a retiree.’ </p><img id="i-6c443e36b1702f9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/09/25/10/44AEF0D300000578-4916792-image-a-38_1506330584577.jpg" height="460" width="634" alt="Investments: The MF Slater Income fund invests £3 in every £100 of savers¿ money in ITV, maker of The X Factor" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Income funds and trusts are a top choice </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, what are the best funds for income in retirement?  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">British savers have billions tied up in so-called equity income funds and it’s easy to see why. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These funds, which primarily invest in leading companies, promise to provide a steady income as well as grow your money. </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS money" data-version="2" id="mol-a89c3260-970c-11e7-b2c5-b71fd282c4f3">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Get help sorting your pension </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Pension freedom has delivered a lot more choice for people retiring today, but also some tough choices.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Should you buy an old-fashioned annuity, keep your pension invested in drawdown, or take lump sums of cash?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How do you balance investing to deliver the income you need with making sure your pot doesn't run out?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Good financial advice is essential when trying to work these things out, but finding it can be tricky.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is Money has teamed up with Timber to offer readers easy access to carefully selected financial advisers who you can trust, with fair and affordable charges.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://timberfinance.com/?utm_source=TIM&amp;utm_medium=TIMarticle&amp;utm_campaign=invest&amp;utm_term=TIMarticle">&gt; Find out if Timber could help you</a></p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">They aim to at least match the average dividend paid to savers who hold shares in the stockmarket, which is currently 3.5 per cent. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This means a decent regular dividend for pensioners to spend as income. One of the most popular funds is the £9.8billion Woodford Equity Income fund, run by star fund manager Neil Woodford. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While the fund has not been a top performer in recent months, Mr Woodford has a long track record of outperforming rival funds by investing in growing firms such as online estate agents ­Purplebricks and biotecfirm <span style="font-size: 16px;">Prothena, as well as blue-chip businesses. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">The fund yields 3.4 per cent — in other words, paying out £34 each year for every £1,000 invested — and has returned 23 per cent over the past three years. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">For those investors seeking to maximise income, the manager this year launched a new Income Focus fund aiming to deliver a greater yield. In its first year the fund aims to yield 5 per cent, although its overall return may be lower than the Equity Income fund as a result. </span></p><img id="i-a96fefd6811229c0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/09/25/10/1ABB9DD4000005DC-4916792-image-a-40_1506330656338.jpg" height="460" width="634" alt="Steady growth: Keeping your cash invested through retirement means you can take an income while your money continues to grow" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Mr Morgan, at Charles Stanley, likes the JO Hambro UK Equity Income, which also backs big British businesses such as Aviva, Barclays and Vodafone. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">The fund has returned 24.2 per cent over the past three years — turning £10,000 into £12,420 — and currently yields 4.3 per cent, or £43 on £1,000 invested. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">But he warns that investors should not just focus on the funds with the highest yield. Instead, he favours those that grow their dividend each year, as this protects against inflation.  </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Graham Spooner, investment analyst at the Share Centre, likes the City of London Investment Trust, which has raised its dividend for 50 years in a row. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">He says: ‘It has one of the longest track records for dividend growth, aiming to grow pay outs by 4 per cent or 5 per cent a year.’ </span></p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">The trust, which yields 3.9p  per cent, invests in big FTSE 100 firms such as drugs firm GlaxoSmithKline, BP and Prudential. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Mr Pemberton likes the Threadneedle UK Equity Income fund, which backs big consumer firms such as Marmite-maker Unilever and supermarket Morrison. Among its biggest investments is pest control group Rentokil Initial, which has performed well recently as it has a large proportion of its business in the U.S. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">This means when it brings profits back to the UK they are boosted, as the pound is weak against the dollar. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">The fund has returned 27.3 per cent over three years and yields 3.8 per cent. Mr Morgan likes Standard Life Equity Income Trust, up 27.1 per cent over the past three years with a yield of 3.6 per cent. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">It has a third of its money in financial firms such as HSBC , ­Prudential and Aviva.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Investment firm Sanlam UK analysed five-year investing returns to compile <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="" href="/money/investing/article-4788990/The-14-best-UK-income-funds-revealed.html">a list of 14 funds it deems to be the best for income</a>. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">CF Miton UK Multi Cap Income, run by fund managers Gervais Williams and Martin Turner, is top of the rankings. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">It has returned 119 per cent over the past five years, turning £10,000 into £21,900. Top investments include Stobart Group, founded in 1970 in Cumbria and now one of Britain’s biggest trucking firms, and McColl’s, which operates 1,650 convenience stores and newsagents. The fund yields 4.14 per cent. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">It also tips the MF Slater Income fund, which invests £3 in every £100 of savers’ money in ITV, maker of The X Factor and the popular Victoria drama series. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">The fund yields 4.27 per cent and has turned £10,000 into £18,500 in the past five years. </span></p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">What about bond funds?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Bond funds invest in the debt of companies and governments. A bond is effectively an IOU whereby the organisation promises to pay a set rate of interest for a loan plus the original sum back after an agreed period. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">The risk is that the firm or government goes bust or defaults on its debt and you don’t get paid. Bond funds invest in hundreds of different loans, which reduces your risk because you’re not overly exposed to the debt of just one entity. </span></p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS money" data-version="2" id="mol-9c76a460-a1d0-11e7-8bfd-d3aa2f8763f7">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">CHECK CHARGES </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Investing isn’t free.

Mr Morgan likes the Newton Real Return fund, which has 20 per cent of its assets in government debt, 17 per cent in cash and 15 per cent in European company shares. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">The fund yields 2.3 per cent and has returned 7.4 per cent over the past three years.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">As an alternative to absolute return funds, he also likes the Investec Diversified Income fund which is a type of one-stop shop fund for investors where the manager invests in bonds and company shares depending on where he thinks the best opportunities are. <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-4367938/50-best-funds-investment-trusts.html"><span class=""> </span></a></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Currently, the fund has 61 per cent of its money in the debt of governments including mexico, New Zealand and Canada and 35 per cent of its cash in company shares such as insurance group RSA. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">The fund, which has returned 12.1 per cent over the past three years, yields 3.4 pe rcent. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Mr Pemberton likes the Premier Multi-Asset Growth and Income fund as a one-stop shop fund option. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">The fund has quite a low yield at 2.2 per cent, but has returned 36.8 per cent over three years. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">It invests in other funds, picking those the manager thinks are best in their field such as Baillie Gifford Corporate Bond, Evenlode Income and Charlemagne Magna Emerging Markets Dividend. </span></p><div class="moduleFull"></div><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-79b3fe20-a1d3-11e7-873c-654270533286">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Invest early for bigger returns </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">The longer you save, the bigger your pension pot might be — and that’s not just because you’ll have put more in. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Compound interest is a phenomenon that has a snowballing effect on your savings. It’s a simple concept that means you earn interest on the profits you have already made.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you invested £10,000 and it grew by 5 per cent, you would have £10,500 — a profit of £500. The next year you will earn interest on those profits as well as the original amount you invested. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If your investments grew another 5 per cent in year two, you would see your annual profits rise to £525, and your pot would now be worth £11,025. If your money grew at 5 per cent a year for 25 years you would have £33,863 even if you hadn’t invested another penny. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After 40 years you would have £70,400.

He also favours International Public Partnerships, which owns schools in Canada, UK health centres and a train leasing firm.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Setting some goals drives your decisions about what to do with your windfall. With a direction in mind, you can plan more effectively.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Consider working with an expert; whether that’s a financial adviser, accountant or tax expert. You want the right type of professional for your situation. Depending on the size or complexity of your windfall, you may even need a team of experts.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong></strong></strong><strong>Pay off debts and possibly your mortgage</strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The interest rate on your credit card is likely to be significantly higher than anything you earn in a savings account or by investing that money instead. You may not want to pay off all your debts with your windfall, but if you can it’s important to deal with any high interest debt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Making an extra mortgage payment or two will mean you end up paying less interest in the long run. However bear in mind that once you have used your capital, you will no longer have access to this money. If the interest rate on your mortgage is very low, you might be better off investing the money for capital growth instead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is very important that you check the terms of your mortgage before you make a large overpayment. Many providers will charge you for early repayments.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong></strong><strong>Bulk up your emergency fund</strong><strong></strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before you start investing, it is important to establish a rainy day fund in an easy access savings account to cover emergencies or unexpected costs. You’ll thank yourself if you unexpectedly experience a job loss or health setback.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a generally accepted rule of thumb, aim to build up your rainy day savings to the equivalent of one of the following:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">• Three months’ income, or </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">• Three to six months’ household expenses </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The exact amount you need depends on what your needs and financial responsibilities are.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong></strong></strong><strong>Think about your children</strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is not hard to be fearful for youngsters today. Governments will be increasingly stretched, final salary pension schemes are already difficult to find and the property market is getting ever further out of reach.</p><img id="i-5f5d61001c07f6f6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/13/09/416203AA00000578-4572824-image-a-2_1497341273172.jpg" height="382" width="306" alt="Jeannie Boyle urges those who come into money to think before they spend" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even with a relatively modest windfall it is possible to leave a legacy for a young person. Junior Isas are a good choice if you would like to fund university costs because they allow access at age 18. If you would like to help with a deposit for a first property then the new Lifetime Isa might be more suitable – but beware, there is not much flexibility with this product.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are thinking about giving away bigger sums you can use a discretionary trust to retain some control over the money. Giving 18 year olds access to large sums of money is not always wise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><strong>Do not leave it all in the bank</strong><strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once you have a rainy day fund, start saving for the future by putting your money to work. The stock market offers the best chance of protecting your wealth from inflation, albeit with some level of risk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the current market environment bank savings rates (eg rates on cash Isas) are significantly lower than inflation. You can make the comparison yourself online by visiting the Office of National Statistics’ website and comparing the Consumer Price Index with the deals offered by your bank.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With rates as they currently stand, money left in the bank will steadily lose value (in real terms) over time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong></strong></strong><strong>Use your tax-efficient ISA allowance</strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are lucky enough to have a significant windfall, start by putting the maximum £20,000 inside this year’s Isa allowance. This can be cash, stocks and shares, the new Lifetime Isa, the Innovative Finance Isa or a mixture of them all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Invest at the beginning of each tax year (6 April) to get the maximum benefit. You can continue to add to your Isa each year, using your new Isa allowance.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><strong>Invest in a pension</strong><strong></strong></p><img id="i-fe89fa364a48c6f2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/13/09/384A882400000578-4572824-image-a-4_1497342278763.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="Pensions have great tax benefits but those who invest in these product would not be able to access the pot until after the age of 55" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pensions also offer valuable tax benefits and have tax relief added in by the Government. If you are in danger of paying tax on your windfall then pensions are a brilliant way to claw back some of that cash.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">25 per cent of your pension fund is available as a tax-free lump sum after age 55. Pension funds can also be used to pass on wealth to your chosen beneficiaries, in some cases entirely free from tax.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><strong>Invest in property</strong><strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If your windfall will stretch to it, then buying a buy-to-let can be a good investment. With a sizeable windfall to put down as a deposit, arranging a mortgage should pose no problem.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you can get enough rent to cover your expenses you are effectively getting someone else to buy the property for you.</p><img id="i-4bc62045e4f21e14" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/13/09/4143739F00000578-4572824-image-a-5_1497342602646.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Buying property to rent out can be a good way of spending surplus cash but recent changes introduced by the government has made this mode of investing less attractive" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">With the availability of low-cost, interest-only mortgages, buy-to-let will remain a popular choice for many. However, recent measures introduced by the Government mean for some investors, buy-to-let will no longer deliver the returns it once did. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rental yields may look enticing, but they are often unrealistic once you have factored in stamp duty and maintenance costs.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><strong>Buy an investment you can forget about</strong><strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are a range products on the market that you can wrap in an Isa or pension. Do not start by investing money into a single company even if you are convinced it is got great prospects. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can choose ready-made portfolios that invest in shares, bonds and other assets across a range of countries and regions – helping to dilute risk whilst improving the chances of investing in the right places.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Reduce risk by spreading out your contributions at regular intervals. A common approach might be to split the investment into four chunks which can be invested at regular intervals over between 12 and 18 months.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whatever you do invest in though, make sure you do your research first and do not invest in anything you do not understand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For married couples, consider joint investments. Often it is possible to arrange your individual tax allowances to minimise income and capital taxes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><strong>Give to charity</strong><strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Giving to a cause close to your heart will benefit others and probably make you feel better about yourself. Some people who come into large sums of money feel guilty about their good fortune. Helping others is a good way to avoid this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Giving to charity is also tax efficient. Donating through Gift Aid means charities can claim an extra £25 for every £100 you give. If you pay tax at 40 per cent you can claim a further £25 tax relief through your self-assessment tax return.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you leave 10 per cent of your net estate as a charitable legacy you may qualify for a reduction in the rate of inheritance tax from 40 per cent to 36 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><strong>Do not forget to take advice</strong><strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Plotting an investment strategy is not always easy or intuitive – particularly if you have never done it before. If you are thinking of investing your windfall, consider hiring a financial adviser to help you achieve your goals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Advice is usually invaluable as the personal recommendations made are based on your circumstances and financial goals. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Initial consultations are often free, and this meeting should enable you to judge whether paying for financial advice will deliver the best value for you overall. </p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Coming into money is not something that happens often, but when it does, it makes sense to take some time to consider your financial situation and your options.

</div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Is stamp collecting still in decline worldwide?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Warren told us: 'There is no doubt that stamp collecting among today's youth is nowhere near as ubiquitous as it was in the 1950/60s. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Then, half of kids - and almost every boy - had a stamp collection. Today, probably fewer than one in 100 has one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'With increasing leisure time and disposable income in retirement, plenty of people are taking up the hobby as an interesting and absorbing pastime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It would be wrong to say that stamp collecting is as popular as ever, but there are still tens of thousands of active collectors in the UK alone, and many millions worldwide, especially in Asia.'</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">The '£50' collection that contained £40k stamp</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unearthing a rare stamp or collection is akin to finding a needle in a haystack, according to Mr Warren. However, they do sometimes turn up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, someone came in with a collection of stamps which the owner wanted to get rid of and almost sold for £50 previously.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, a check uncovered a rare 1850 Prince Consort stamp, one of only three examples known – the other two are in Royal collection and in the Royal Mint heritage collection.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In layman's terms, Mr Warren explains it was a trial printing to see how Albert's face would look in a stamp, instead of Victoria's, and what made this one especially valuable is that it was perforated - holes round the edge - rather than being imperforate, as most issued stamps up to that date had been.</p><img id="i-56d4ae8c84434ffc" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/08/11/430B0EE200000578-4760444-image-a-3_1502186703574.jpg" height="303" width="306" alt="Rare stamps: These Chinese stamps were spotted in an old insignificant notebook - and sold for a giant sum at auction" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The stamp sold for £40,000 at auction.

The AA, RAC, Dekra and Autolign all have inspectors who know what to look for.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold">- Invest in a history check</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There may be more lurking in a ‘Cat’ car than the effects of the accident that put it into that category, so don’t skimp on normal secondhand car checks to discover if it’s been stolen or has any outstanding finance on it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>- Watch out for newer cars that seem incredibly cheap</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A very low price on a newish car might tell you that repair work has been done on the cheap and isn't up to the job. If it looks and smells like a fish, it probably is a fish.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold">- Avoid any car that might have a damaged chassis</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Visible damage to a car’s exterior panels can be fairly easily fixed, but repairing damage to the underlying chassis is a much more exacting job. Poor work here can adversely affect the way a car handles, or severely reduce crash protection.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold">- Having decided that you’re going to buy a Cat D or Cat N car, remember to...</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1. Tell your insurance company. Inform them that your car is a Cat D or Cat N so it can be marked on your policy, minimising the risk of any claim being rejected.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2. Check into a warranty. A used-car warranty is a low-cost way of getting some peace of mind for Cat D or Cat N cars.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>We’ve all seen ads for cars that seem incredibly cheap, only to see the dreaded phrase ‘Category D’ tucked away at the bottom of the spiel.

It said if a consumer signs up to a contract for a service, for which they agree to pay, over a fixed period of time, unless the contract clearly gives a consumer the right to terminate early, they are not entitled to do so.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'However, a contract that says if the consumer terminates early they must pay a fee is potentially unfair, for the following reason.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-large">Who needs expat mortgages and what are the typical reasons? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Britons living abroad, either temporarily or permanently, will need to obtain a mortgage from a lender that has chosen to lend to expats. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Typically, expats are looking to invest in buy-to-let property whilst living overseas, perhaps as a way to provide an income in retirement or even to live in upon their return. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whilst fluctuating exchange rates can, at times, provide a good opportunity for investors, it is also true to say that many expats earn better salaries abroad than they would do here, and the correspondingly lower cost of living means they have more disposable income and want to invest in UK property.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aside from investors, we also see enquiries from individuals looking to buy properties for their families to live in – frequently where children are involved and the preference is for them to be schooled in the UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-large">Why are expat mortgages now harder to come by?</p><img id="i-a027f16469801c69" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/11/10/4237562200000578-0-image-a-2_1499763611212.jpg" height="433" width="306" alt="Fleming-Duffy: Typically, expats are looking to invest in buy-to-let property" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">One word: regulation. You don’t need to be a financial guru to be aware of the regulatory changes that have affected global markets over the past few years. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mortgages have been affected by rules introduced in 2014, which made things tricky for all potential borrowers whose income and expenditure had to be evidenced after this time. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But for expats things are tougher still. Following European rules brought in last year, individuals paid in a foreign currency must now come under closer scrutiny when their applications are assessed by mortgage underwriters. </p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-4aaddf20-75c7-11e7-bb5f-cb03d8997850">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> There is a real hurdle facing expats in Australia.</div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Exchange rate fluctuations have to be taken into account - not just the current value of the currency - and many lenders go to great lengths to assess a potential borrower's global financial position. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is to ensure that they feel comfortable that the new mortgage will not put them under undue financial stress now, or in the future. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Additionally, lenders operating in this sector will need to conduct enhanced due diligence on each application which, in turn, means more detailed administration. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We saw a few lenders withdraw from expat lending last year as a direct result of the European rules.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is also a real hurdle facing expats in Australia. There is an inter-governmental treaty between Britain and Australia that technically precludes lending to each other’s residents.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would be good to see this change and, following the joint press conference held by Theresa May and Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, this may indeed become a focus of renewed co-operation between our countries as Australia is a key destination for many British expats.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-large">How should I apply for for an expat mortgage? </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">For buy-to-let mortgages, we have identified over forty lenders willing to provide mortgages to expats. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For mortgages on properties to be occupied by the applicants (or their families) there are just ten lenders. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are many potential options if you are looking to borrow over £100,000, already have a UK mortgage, work for a corporate employer with a salary of £40,000 sterling equivalent, paid in US dollars or euros, reside in a Financial Action Task Force  country and have a good deposit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But if this isn't you, don't worry. There are also mortgages available to those that don’t fit these criteria and this is where the expertise of a good broker comes in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-large">I want my family to live in the property while I'm abroad - what are the options? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">High street lenders HSBC and Santander can provide residential mortgages to expats, in certain circumstances. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Neither lender charges a higher fee for expats, although HSBC has fairly restricted criteria and also limits its product distribution so you may find it tricky to get access. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nat West International, a wholly owned subsidiary of RBS Group, is fairly flexible in its approach to the marketplace, and require a 20 per cent deposit as a minimum.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Expat residential mortgages are assessed in the same way as those for UK residents, with the added costs of living overseas and exchange rate fluctuations taken into account. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lenders such as Santander can provide expats with mortgages with as little as a 5 per cent deposit. However most lenders operating in the sector require a larger deposit – sometimes as high as 35 per cent of the property valuation or purchase price – before considering an application. </p><img id="i-2695c8b9b9a42ccc" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/31/16/42D8260100000578-4745780-image-a-13_1501516729234.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="If you have moved overseas then getting a mortgage for a UK property is tougher" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-large">I want to purchase a buy-to-let property in the UK - what are the options? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Buy-to-let lending is where the market is most buoyant for expats. New entrants such as Vida Home Loans and Landbay are offering mortgages based on very flexible criteria with competitively priced mortgage deals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a rule, you will need a minimum 25 per cent deposit for buy-to-let, with the rental income effectively defining how much you can borrow. </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most lenders require the property to wash its face, which means it typically needs the rental income to exceed the mortgage payments by a ratio of 145 per cent if the mortgage rate was 5.5 per cent. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the Marsden Building Society can take applications if there is a rental shortfall and the applicant is paid in a currency which is on their approved currency list.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This currently includes the US Dollar, Euro, Norwegian Krone, Swiss Franc, Qatari Riyal, Denmark Krone, Canadian Dollar, Sweden Krona, Chinese Yuan/Renminbi, United Arab Emirates Dinar, Saudi Arabian Riyal, Hong Kong Dollar, Kuwaiti Dinar and Singaporean Dollar.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The mutual will take a limited amount of earned income into its affordability assessment. The rental income must cover the mortgage payments by a ratio of 125 per cent at a 5.5 per cent mortgage rate as an absolute minimum, with the shortfall made up from earned income.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> The application process for all expat mortgages will feel very bureaucratic to the uninitiated and we generally advise that applications will take around six to eight weeks before a mortgage offer will be issued.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Almost five million Britons live or work outside the UK and many of them don't want to give up property ownership in their homeland.

In return for that loan, they promise to pay you back the sum you invested after a set period and to make an annual interest payment, known as the coupon. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bonds are measured by their yield, which is the coupon they pay out as a percentage of their purchase price. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, for example, a £100 bond with a £5 per year coupon would yield 5 per cent. Bonds can be bought and sold second-hand after issue, and their price in the market will be affected by demand, so if demand rises and that £100 bond trades hands for £110, the yield is now £5 on £110, or 4.54 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bond yields across the developed world are very low, as investors are willing to accept lower payouts, largely thanks to rock bottom interest rates, years of quantitative easing and low or stagnant economic growth. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For a while now, economists have been speculating about when interest rates will start to rise in the UK, with most currently forecasting incremental hikes no earlier than late this year or early next year. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This, along with relatively slow economic growth and low inflation expectations, has helped to keep bond prices up and yields low. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are many reasons for low bond yields - central banks buying up bonds through QE is a huge factor, as well as vast amounts of pension fund money pouring into the asset class and low inflation expectations suggesting that capital will hold its value.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">UK government bond yields fell to record lows at the end of last year and remain below 1 per cent - but this could change if the Bank of England starts to tighten monetary policy by raising rates or shutting down QE. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Short-dated bonds are considered to have the best protection against faster than expected interest rate rises, while longer-dated bonds are at greater risk of things changing unexpectedly through their term.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This extraordinary backdrop means that many consider government bonds to not be the lowest possible risk investment that they once were, however, they top grade government bonds are still considered a key part of investment portfolios - and one that should provide some buffer in times of stock market storms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you decide to buy into government bonds, there are a number of ways to do it including managed funds - but a cost effective way is through an exchange traded fund.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-bd6bab40-72d5-11e7-ae56-efc00ee5f64b">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">A bit of background on bonds</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">While few can correctly predict the path of investment values, for nearly all investors, making sure you have a diverse spread of asset classes in your investment portfolio is key to ensuring you don't over-expose yourself to one company, sector or asset type.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For most, bonds form an important component of their portfolio. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bonds - a fixed term security issued by companies or countries to raise debt - are typically seen as lower risk than equities, because should a company or country default on what they owe, bondholders will get their money back before shareholders. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This doesn't make them risk-free, however, as the experience of Greek government bondholders in 2011 and 2012 can attest: they were forced to take a 'haircut' on their assets after Greece admitted it simply couldn't afford its interest payments.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-30a818a0-72d6-11e7-bdd1-d34487160fbb">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> There are a multitude of bonds to choose from and each offers different levels of risk and reward</div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are a multitude of bonds to choose from and each offers different levels of risk and reward: junk bonds are usually cheap and offer high returns on the basis their probability of default is higher than AAA-rated corporate bonds which are often seen as a fairly 'safe' bet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Governments also issue bonds - in the UK they are referred to as gilts and in the US as treasuries.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Where the government bond is issued on behalf of a country with its own currency and central bank and has coupons paid in its own currency, it's less likely that a situation such as that seen in Greece will arise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is because central banks can create its own money to pay the interest it owes to investors on bonds.</p></div>                        </div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Five ETFs for highly-rated bonds</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>We asked Oliver Smith, portfolio manager at IG, for five  ETFs for investing in government bonds.

Therefore long-dated debt is more susceptible to short-term losses when interest rates rise. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Investors in bonds need to take into consideration the shape of the yield curve.

The Post Office has offered him a £20 payment in compensation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trevor says: 'I have never used a travel card before and I will not be using one again.

That's the best way for our customers to use the card; paying with it is commission and fee free when used in one of the 13 currencies we support that can be loaded on the card.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When making purchases abroad we strongly recommend completing the transaction in the local currency, as converting the transaction to sterling will result in additional fees. These fees include a Dynamic Currency Conversion fee, none of which is levied or received by the Post Office; for cash withdrawals, ATM charges are very common and apply to credit, debit and prepaid products.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We try to make our explanation of how best to use our Travel Money Card as clear as possible, providing welcome packs with the cards and setting out the details of potential fees that may be incurred on our website. Our colleagues in branch are also on hand to answer any questions our customers may have. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We apologise if Mr Grundy feels he didn't receive all the information he needed on this occasion, and we have offered him a goodwill gesture to say sorry. To try and make it even easier for customers, we will be introducing leaflets that will come with every card purchased, both in branch and online, to provide customers with a further explanation of how to avoid these fees.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other charges on the Post Office card includes a £5 fee to close the account.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Car hire firms are aware that these prices are unaffordable and terrifying for many families, so will try to sell you so-called excess waiver insurance. In principle, this is a good idea, as it means you don't pay any of the repair bill.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But don't buy this from your car hire firm at the pick-up desk or you'll pay up to £170.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is much cheaper to get a policy from a third-party insurer before you leave for your holiday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Firms such as Reducemyexcess.co.uk and iCarhireinsurance.com offer cover for less than £3 a day or annual cover for around £40. Use comparison website moneymaxim.co.uk to find the cheapest deals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ignore pushy staff at the collection desks abroad, who'll try to tell you that this third-party insurance is not valid.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, bear in mind that they will still need to block off a deposit on your credit card if you don't buy their waiver policy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then, if you do get charged for repairs, you will have to pay upfront out of this deposit and claim the money back from the excess waiver insurance firm afterwards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even for cheaper models, families could find themselves lumbered with huge bills if they scratch or dent their cars.</p><img id="i-5930b8b92a81593f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/18/21/1C4C7A8A00000578-4708510-image-a-44_1500409262609.jpg" height="433" width="634" alt="If you damage your car on holiday, you usually have to pay the first few hundred pounds of any repair bill before your insurance kicks in" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Quotes obtained from the Budget website show the excess is £5,614 for a Volvo S60, or £3,346 for a Mini Cooper convertible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When we called Budget to check the quotes and told them some of their excess charges were approaching €10,000, a customer service adviser admitted: 'That's pretty outrageous. That's a new one on me.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After checking his computer, he added: 'Yeah, €9,594 excess on the Mercedes. The higher-end vehicles do have the higher excess. It varies from country to country. For Portugal, that's going to be normal.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He added that excess charges for hire cars in the UK tended to be lower than this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last night, Budget had not responded to Money Mail's requests for comment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>BILLS FOR REPAIRS THAT NEVER WERE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Several Money Mail readers claim car hire firms have tried to charge them hundreds of pounds for dents and scratches that were never repaired.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It comes with Europcar facing a scandal over accusations that it overcharged customers for car hire repairs by £30 million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trading Standards is investigating claims that up to half-a-million UK customers could have been affected over a decade. The Serious Fraud Office is also said to be aware of the case.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fears are growing that some firms may use similar practices at European destinations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Support worker Lynette Taylor, 31, is in dispute with Europcar in Switzerland because she says it has billed her almost £800 'for a small scuff mark on the bumper' of a hire car. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I signed to say I didn't cause the damage as at no point did I go into anything, so perhaps it happened when the car was parked,' she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I managed to block my credit card before they could take the money and they have been trying to get it ever since. The worst part is, I asked them if they had actually repaired the car and their answer was 'no'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They suggested it probably wouldn't be repaired. Therefore they are charging me a repair bill for repairs not even carried out.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Self-employed cleaner Gina Cooper, of Chislehurst, Kent, says she was driving a hire car with Enterprise when a Land Rover reversed into her at traffic lights.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The drivers stopped and swapped details, but could see no damage.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><img id="i-c2fccc0392b79da0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/18/21/28B8557F00000578-4708510-image-a-45_1500409571713.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Even for cheaper models, families could find themselves lumbered with huge bills if they scratch or dent their cars" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">When she returned the car to Enterprise, she told staff, who inspected the car and found a small scratch on the bumper.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gina, 46, passed on the details of the Land Rover driver and thought nothing more of it. But two months later, she received a letter from Enterprise, billing her the £500 excess for the scratch and claiming it had been trying to contact her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The letter referred to the 'above invoice', but none was attached.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She called Enterprise, who promised to look into her complaint. But several weeks later, she received a letter from a debt recovery firm.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I hate that these big companies are always the winners when this debt will seriously affect me,' says Gina. A spokesman for Enterprise says: 'We are currently investigating her case to check that our procedures have been followed.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Enterprise says that once a repair has been completed, it refunds the customer if the bill was lower than the cost of the excess.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If another vehicle caused the damage, Enterprise says its policy is to take details of any third party, so that it can recover the cost of the repair and reimburse the customer's excess.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most UK car hire firms adhere to a code of conduct set out by the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have an unresolved complaint, you can contact the BVRLA's dispute resolution service by emailing complaint@bvrla.co.uk or calling 01494 434747.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Citizens Advice can also help — call 03454 04 05 06.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are no specific EU regulations governing car hire in Europe. But if you have a complaint about a car you hired while abroad in an EU country and cannot resolve it, try the UK European Consumer Centre on 01268 886690.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>YOU MUST BRING YOUR OWN SAT NAV</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hiring a sat nav or child seats from car hire giants can cost more than double the price of buying a brand-new one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Money Mail found Hertz is charging up to £204 to hire a satellite navigation system powered by TomTom for a two-week break in August from major European airports.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet a basic TomTom bought online from Currys costs just £86.99.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hertz also charges up to £115 for a child's car seat for a two-week trip.

Models with suckers that stick to the windscreen are available for less than £10 from Amazon.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are worried about exceeding your data allowance or patchy internet connection, or you are travelling outside the EU, you can download offline maps (or buy a paper one).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before you go, enter your destination into your Google Maps app and click on 'offline' in the app's settings on your phone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can then download maps of a certain area abroad and use it as you travel from the airport to your hotel, for example.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Similarly, try to take your own child car seat, which can usually be checked in free of charge. Trunki sells portable car seats that fold into rucksacks for £44.99.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you don't want to lug a car seat on holiday, do your research and check what brand your car hire firm will provide, as they can vary wildly in quality.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are also huge variations in the price of car seats and sat navs, depending on where you go on holiday, so it is worth seeing if you will be charged a fortune before deciding where to travel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, at Naples Airport, in southern Italy, it costs up to £204 for a sat nav with Hertz and £115 for a car seat for a two-week trip this summer. But at Nice Airport, it costs £166 for a sat nav and £41 for a car seat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hertz at London Heathrow charges £199 for a sat nav and £84 for a car seat, while at Lanzarote Airport, the cost was £159 for a sat nav, but a relatively cheaper £68 for a car seat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hertz did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WATCH OUT FOR FUEL LOOPHOLES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You should always opt for the 'return full' petrol policy, as other options will almost certainly cost more. It might sound tempting to avoid having to refill your car on your way to the airport, but it is worth doing so if you have time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Europcar's 'refuelling service', for example, allows you to bring it back without a full tank. They will charge you at the national average litre price as published by PetrolPrices.com.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the sting is in the service charge of £1.60 per litre. So, if a typical tank holds 55 litres and you returned it empty, you would be charged £88 in handling fees alone. Europcar says it is 'very rare' that a customer would return the vehicle empty.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alternatively, car hire firms often offer a 'full tank' option, where you pay upfront for a full tank. But firms will either offer no refund for any unused fuel, or refund the cost of the unused fuel but charge a fee.</p><img id="i-3d5d7fdefef59b51" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/18/21/008026FA00000258-4708510-It_might_sound_tempting_to_avoid_having_to_refill_your_car_on_yo-m-48_1500409722735.jpg" height="415" width="634" alt="It might sound tempting to avoid having to refill your car on your way to the airport, but it is worth doing so if you have time." class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, Goldcar in Majorca reportedly bills customers a 'handling charge' of up to £24 for refunding the fuel that has not been used.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Always check that your hire car has unlimited mileage for the country you are visiting, as some firms charge a small fortune for excess mileage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Watch out for extra charges for having a diesel car or automatic. For example, Goldcar charges an extra €4 a day for diesel. Ask at the desk, as you may then be able to switch cars and save money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MYSTERY CHARGES AFTER YOU'VE PAID</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hire car firms in the UK must always write to you before they charge you for damage repairs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Money Mail has heard from holidaymakers who hire cars abroad and then notice mystery deductions on their bank statements when they return home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Similarly, watch out for 'extras' that may have been ticked on your booking form or are lurking on your final invoice when you return the car.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Car hire firms can add obscure add-ons such as 'fee waiver', which covers you against the firm's admin costs in the event the driver is fined for speeding.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One driver says he was assured verbally by Europcar that it was free to add an additional driver when he picked up a car in Newcastle.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But when he later checked his statement, he had been billed for this anyway.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Europcar says this was an administrative error and has refunded the charge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it's a reminder that checking your paperwork is not something you should overlook.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To avoid surprise charges for damage, try to return your car during the day and ensure the car rental firm has 'signed off' the vehicle as OK before you leave.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If they have only verbally agreed that it looks fine, and not signed it off, then later discover a scratch — when the car has been washed, for example — you could still be pursued for payment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many people take photographs of scratches upon collection, but forget to take them upon drop-off as well.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Take photos of the car on your smartphone after you have parked up at the rental firm to return it. These photos will be timed and dated in the event of a dispute.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman for the BVRLA warns drivers to always return their car during office hours, adding: 'If the rental company allows you to return the vehicle out of hours, you remain responsible for the condition of the vehicle until a member of staff is able to carry out a full inspection.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'That means the cost of any damage caused to the vehicle while it remains unattended is your responsibility.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">l.eccles@dailymail.co.uk</p><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Some holidaymakers claim they are being billed for repairs that never take place.

How does this position contribute to the organisation's success?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2. What do you hope I will accomplish in this position?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">3.

You need to understand whether the company is a fit for your values, passions and interests too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you pose a simple 'what is the company culture like?' question, it is too easy for the interviewer to come back with something marketing department or human resources approved.

How long do people tend to stick around at this company?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Salary, progression and perks</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During an interview is the perfect time to ask informed and important questions about pay. No, it's not presumptive or rude; in fact, it's an important factor in your decision-making process:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">12. What is the salary range for this role?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">13. Besides the base pay, what other benefits are negotiable?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">14.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sarah Davidson, of This is Money, replies: </strong>Property development and buy-to-let have been profitable for investors over the past 20 years, but both require careful management to get right.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Buy-to-let can go wrong very quickly if you purchase the wrong type of property for the tenant demand in the area, with even two or three months unlet meaning you fall behind on your mortgage payments. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Similarly with property development, you need to be absolutely sure you understand the local market and deliver the refurbished property to the standard that buyers in the area want and will pay for - there's no point doing a swanky family home in a student area for example. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once you are comfortable and sure that you want to proceed, you should consider taking independent advice from a specialist finance broker with experience helping first-time developers and landlords. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most mortgage brokers don't get involved with arranging specialist finance themselves, and are likely instead to refer you to someone with the right expertise. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are several elements to your situation that you need to think about carefully. To help, I've broken them down into stages. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-large">Setting up a company</p><img id="i-afcbdbd6b50789bb" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/07/13/174495FE00000514-4674510-image-a-5_1499430419505.jpg" height="216" width="306" alt="Limited company buy-to-let  has become far more popular recently" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">This can be a good idea if you and your friend are going to be doing the developments together, but you should get professional tax and legal advice to help you structure how you plan to take any profits out of the company, as this could affect other elements of your finances - child tax credits for example. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are also different types of company, some of which may be more or less suitable for what you're planning. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Limited company buy-to-let comes in different forms, and has become far more popular recently because of changes to the way personal landlords are taxed. However, usually these companies are simply a special purpose vehicle designed to house the property and income - they won't necessarily come with the long list of responsibilities that owning and directing a company brings. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These can include legally having to file accounts, board meetings, making tax digital, and if you have employees  - there is auto-enrolment and payroll to consider among other things. </p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-large">Finance</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's important to understand that finance lent against property comes in a plethora of different forms depending on what you plan to do with the property in question.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Residential mortgages (the cheapest) are for those wanting to live in the property themselves, buy-to-let bought in your own name is the next cheapest and is only given when you plan to rent out the property. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More expensive is limited company buy-to-let which nevertheless still requires to you let out the property. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Within buy-to-let there are also niche areas such as HMOs - houses in multiple occupation - this is where you rent out individual lockable rooms to separate tenants on separate tenancy agreements. </p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-0dabfb40-6314-11e7-b51b-fbf147e09baf">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> For the sort of project you describe, it sounds as though you should be looking at taking a light to heavy refurbishment loan</div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Commercial mortgages apply when there is a business being run from the property and these are more expensive still.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is also bridging finance which has traditionally been used to cover the cost of moving house if you buy your next home before you've sold your previous one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bridging has always been around but over the past seven years or so, it has matured considerably with a range of banks and professional though small specialist lenders now offering bridging loans. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ten years ago you would have paid 2.5 per cent a month for a bridge, whereas now - depending on the amount of equity you put into the property, some lenders will charge just 0.6 per cent a month plus an arrangement fee which is typically between 1 and 2 per cent of the loan amount.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is also development finance, typically used where the property is in a dreadful state and needs a complete overhaul or where you plan to knock down a property to build a new one  in its place, or where you have bought land and plan to do what's known as a 'ground up' development. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In between development finance and bridging there sits a range of niche funding options including bridge-to-let, light and heavy refurbishment funding and auction finance. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-large">Doing up a dive </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the sort of project you describe, one option would be taking a light to heavy refurbishment loan for the period in which you want to do up the property, which you would then repay on its sale.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These loans can be anything from around 0.6 per cent a month to 1.5 per cent a month and the price you pay will depend on the specifics of the deal. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Generally, lenders offering this type of product will lend up to 70 or 75 per cent loan-to-value so you'll need a minimum of 25 per cent deposit to put in yourself. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The more equity you can put into the deal, the lower the rate you'll be offered. You can't search these loans however, as usually they are priced personally for you and your circumstances. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's also important to be sure that you can get the work done in the time frame you agree at the start, as some lenders charge extension fees if you go over the initially agreed loan term, others will charge you penalty fees on top.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The loan amount will be calculated on either the existing value when you purchase the property or some lenders will lend against your projected sale value, known as gross development value.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your exit from the loan is key to getting approved - you'll need to demonstrate that similar properties in the area are selling at the price you expect or if you plan to keep the property, that you will definitely be able to get a buy-to-let mortgage to refinance to when the refurbishment is complete.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Specialist lenders tend also to operate through brokers only, some of whom will be able to get you cheaper rates than brokers who don't deal with these lenders all the time - so this is why it's really worth tracking down a specialist with a good reputation. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Experience and access</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While you may have done up your own homes, both you and your friend would still be classed as first-time developers or landlords which drastically reduces the number of lenders willing to give you finance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are a few however, so find a broker who specifically helps inexperienced landlords and developers who has a good relationship with these lenders. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before you leap into development however, I would suggest speaking to a quality independent mortgage broker who operates in the residential and buy-to-let markets which are far more heavily regulated and offer you consumer protection if things go wrong. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The danger with going straight to an unregulated broker is that they may help you get the finance but if things don't work out, you could end up severely damaging your finances. So get the full picture looked at by a qualified adviser before you sign on the dotted line. </p><img id="i-9ee8ee7a82f4266f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/07/12/421D6A5A00000578-4674510-image-a-1_1499428536368.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Hollingworth: Buy-to-let lenders typically require the property to be in lettable condition" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">We've asked <strong>David Hollingworth, of fully regulated independent mortgage broker London &amp; Country</strong>, to answer your questions from his perspective. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says: As you’ve recognised, the finance options for those looking to refurbish and develop property will generally work in a different way and at a different price from those on offer for traditional buy-to-let landlords.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the products are really designed to do different things and the criteria that will be applied will reflect that. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Buy-to-let is primarily designed for those looking to purchase or refinance property that will be let out as a longer term investment, generating an income and providing potential for capital appreciation over time. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Short-term funding is a more commercial finance option for those seeking to develop and refurbish property to then resell at a profit. As a consequence rates will typically be higher than you’d expect on a buy-to-let mortgage in the longer run.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-e34376e0-6312-11e7-b51b-fbf147e09baf">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> If there is no intention to let the property out at all, that is likely to be enough to result in buy-to-let lenders turning the case down</div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">If there is no intention to let the property out at all, that is likely to be enough to result in buy-to-let lenders turning the case down. Even if there was an intention to let there could be some sticking points though.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the primary issues for buy-to-let lenders is that they will typically require the property to be in lettable condition when you buy it. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They want to be sure that the property will be suitable for letting from day one, as they will put a good deal of focus on the expected rental income when deciding how much a prospective landlord can afford to borrow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That alone will rule out the use of most buy-to-let mortgages for refurbishment purposes and lenders will conduct a valuation to double check. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This will be carried out by an independent valuer who will be required to identify if the property is in suitable condition to allow it to be let as well as making an assessment of what that rental income is likely to be. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That will depend to a degree on the level of refurbishment that is required but it sounds like the focus here is on adding more significant value and therefore is presumably more than a lick of paint.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-large">Some lenders allow you to refurbish first </p><img id="i-7a6405d5ec8f3b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/07/13/3025617600000578-4674510-image-a-6_1499432184980.jpg" height="410" width="634" alt="Work needs to be completed within three months and the niche rates are still higher" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are some buy-to-let lenders that do offer mortgages designed for landlords that will need to carry out some refurbishment of the property before it is let. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These will typically be designed to assist those that simply need some light refurbishment before being let.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example Saffron Building Society offers a product designed for those wanting to purchase a property in need of light refurbishment and can release additional funds once work is completed and re-inspection bears out the projected end value. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The work needs to be completed within three months and the niche rates are still higher and will carry an early repayment charge for at least a year depending on the product.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another limiting factor for your situation is that this product is not available to those wanting to purchase through a limited company. This is still a more specialised area of lending in the buy-to-let market with specialist lenders tending to be the bigger players. </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">However that doesn’t necessarily make them more amenable to refurbishment projects. For example, Kent Reliance will lend to limited companies but does still expect the property to be lettable. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It might consider allowing the most basic of sprucing up but will put a retention on the funds if anything more significant is required, which would make a purchase impossible for many.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The buy-to-let lenders that might look at refurbishment and limited company lending such as Shawbrook Bank will also want to see evidence of experience of this kind of refurbishment or other property investment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ultimately your scenario doesn’t really fit with buy-to-let and you will find more options from those offering bridging and short-term funding options. Lenders such as Shawbrook, and others including Precise Mortgages which has a bridge-to-let product and Castle Trust which offers a flex refurb plus other bridging specialists are more likely to have products to meet your needs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although the annual rates are higher on short-term lending, rates can be available from around 0.70 per cent per month. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That underlines how important it will be for you to have a very clear project plan with realistic timelines, as the exit plan will have a bearing on overall cost of the finance.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>We don’t want to use bridging finance as this seems really expensive, but we would be looking to sell the property after we have done the refurbishment - can we get buy-to-let mortgage to do this?</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>This Is Money</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Alex Sebastian</dc:creator><dc:modified>2017-07-11T07:41:47.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Getting into property development for the first time?</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2017-07-11T07:41:47.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/buytolet/article-4447064/Should-invest-commercial-buy-let.html" title="Should you invest in commercial property as returns on traditional buy-to-let slide?"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/buytolet/article-4404548/I-need-mortgage-bank-won-t-help-60.html" title="I want to borrow £50,000 to refurbish my property before letting it - but my bank won't help because I'm 60"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/mortgageshome/article-4360258/How-Brexit-really-affect-Britain-s-housing-market.html" title="How will Brexit really affect Britain's property market?

<p class="mol-para-with-font">After years of rising house prices, nearly all of the major indices are beginning to point to <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="" href="/money/mortgageshome/article-4588252/Will-shock-election-2017-result-cause-house-prices-fall.html">slowing house price inflation</a> and in some cases, even a dip in prices. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anecdotal evidence from agents suggests that some buyers are already feeling a lot more confident at putting in a cheeky offer well below the asking price, but many sellers feel they've already priced low to secure a sale and don't want to drop any further.</p><img id="i-c3f6d9e0152814a2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/28/16/41D7EA3300000578-4617338-image-a-19_1498663615378.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="What is the tipping point on house prices?

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">First-time buyers still want to get on the ladder as soon as possible. So what is the best course of action if you really want your first home but you want the best possible deal?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We have asked Paula Higgins, chief executive of independent lobbying body The Homeowners Alliance, to answer your questions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">I really want the house but should I offer asking price if house prices generally are falling?</p><img id="i-bcf905401d71ae17" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/28/17/41D7AF1200000578-4617338-Higgins_Sellers_have_a_not_so_secret_weapon_on_their_side_the_wi-a-20_1498666759585.jpg" height="362" width="305" alt="Higgins: 'Sellers have a not-so-secret weapon on their side - the widely-known fact that demand is by far outstripping supply.'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The news that average house prices are falling for the first time in eight years is sure to be music to the ears of millions of would be home buyers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a market where prices are heading downwards it is much easier for a buyer to feel confident enough during the negotiation process to go in with an offer below asking price. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, sellers have a not-so-secret weapon on their side - the widely-known fact that demand is by far outstripping supply. When deciding whether to offer asking price it’s important to look at the norm in the neighbourhood you are considering buying in - not the wider housing market. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While market trends are useful to get an overall picture they don’t always give insight into what’s happening in specific areas of the country or the specific village or road the house is on. Sought after areas of a city will remain sought after regardless of what the general picture is showing so if you’re looking to buy a house in an area where buyers always outstrip available properties it’s important to bear that in mind if you don’t want to keep losing out on houses in your chosen location. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">What information do I need from the estate agent if I want to negotiate?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Check how long the house has been on the market. If it’s been listed for a while this suggests other people think the property is overpriced. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You should also check whether the asking price has dropped at all since it’s been on the market as this is a likely sign the property is struggling to sell.</p><img id="i-80a7c16fee5faf8b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/28/17/0ACEF1DC000005DC-4617338-image-a-21_1498666978491.jpg" height="420" width="634" alt="Find out if the property is being marketed by several agents who can put pressure on the seller" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Have there been offers on the property already? The estate agent cannot by law tell you what these offers have been but they may be able to give an indication of whether they were very close or way off which could help you pitch the price right. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Find out about the seller. Do they want to move quickly? Have they already found their next house? If they are keen to move before a baby arrives or for a job then they are much more likely to be receptive to a lower offer. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Often sellers value the right kind of purchaser even more than price, especially if they’re in a chain. First-time buyers are chain free and if they can show they are ready to move fast with a mortgage in principle in place, they will be a much more attractive proposition than a second stepper in a chain, so use this to your advantage.  </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Find out if the property is being marketed by several agents. If this is the case you can be sure the agent through which you’re making a viewing is much more likely to encourage the seller to accept a lower offer - agents naturally want to ensure they get the commission ahead of their competitors. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">What’s a sensible offer to make? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Do your research. What have recent sold prices of similar houses been in the local area? If it is much lower than asking price but there is little evident difference, pitch that price with your reasoning. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Again it really depends on the local market, competition and how much you want the house but look at offering between 5 and 10 per cent lower than the asking price initially. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Buyers often fall into the trap of thinking they have to throw everything at a property as they only get one chance but this isn’t the case. Agents are obliged to put your offer to the seller and if a higher offer is made by another buyer they will come back to you to tell you and give you a chance to reconsider your offer. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">According to the agent there’s plenty of interest in this property, should I make a high offer to be safe?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Be conscious of estate agent tricks. In a sellers' market where the number of willing buyers outstrips the number of properties on offer you may find the agent is trying to induce a panic among interested parties in order to increase bids. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stay cool and remember regardless of the market or the property, you can only afford what you can afford. Avoid getting yourself into financial difficulty simply because you got caught up in the moment. </p><img id="i-6bcef7a8d9075534" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/28/17/2205952800000578-4617338-image-a-22_1498667114684.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Buyers often fall into the trap of thinking they have to throw everything at a property" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">Can I stop the vendor accepting someone else’s offer if they gazump me? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unfortunately not. While gazumping is an unpleasant practice - and a growing concern according to our latest survey - it is not illegal. Sellers naturally want to get the highest price for their property and, on occasion, that means they’ll accept a higher offer even when they’ve already agreed to yours. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are some steps you can take to avoid being gazumped however. Make clear your offer is subject to the property being taken off the market. This should reduce the chances of being gazumped. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Getting to know the sellers can also help; if you’re in contact with them regularly they will find it harder to accept an offer from a stranger. Showing you’re serious by pressing ahead with your survey is also a good idea.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You should also consider taking out home buyer insurance which will help you to recoup some of the costs if the sale does fall through. </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money floatRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-d8b82ea0-5c14-11e7-823f-7758284c9fbc">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">FIRST-TIME BUYERS ARE RELUCTANT TO HAGGLE ON HOUSING </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Research from Barclays Mortgages has revealed that 51 per cent of those who bought a home for the first time in the past five years regret not negotiating before purchase.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Figures on property purchases made through estate agent Countrywide between April 2016 and April 2017 show that one in five (21 per cent) British first-time buyers paid over the asking price for their property. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In England and Wales, it’s not Londoners but those in Yorkshire and Humber who proved to be the most likely to go over the asking price with almost a third, 29 per cent, paying more than the initial selling price. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Scotland, the figure is even higher at 40 per cent but this reflects the fact that properties are often purchased through the sealed bid system.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Barclays research claimed that a huge 91 per cent of first-time buyers who purchased within the past five years, believe there is not enough negotiating advice available from trusted sources.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold">I want to gazunder my previous offer as prices in the area are coming down – how do I do this without losing the property? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before approaching the homeowner with a lower offer you’ll need to establish why you’re doing so. If a survey has found problems that will be costly to rectify or you’ve uncovered information, perhaps about plans to the surrounding area, which you know will impact on house prices then you have a justifiable reason to go in with a lower offer and the owner may be receptive to this. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If, however, you just want to try your luck because you’ve read house prices are falling you’re playing a dangerous game. House price activity changes regularly; just a few weeks ago most indices reported house price growth. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tread carefully so as not to risk losing the home you’ve spent months trying to buy. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">I can understand negotiating the price down in London, but is it something I could get away with where prices are much lower? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remember, a house is only worth what someone is prepared to pay for it. It’s a cliche but it’s true. Just because a property is priced much lower than its equivalent in the capital would be doesn’t mean it’s priced fairly for its area or, indeed, for current market conditions. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you considered all of the above and compared it with other properties for sale in the area and you think you could get it for less then offer less. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">Is price the only thing I should be negotiating? What about the condition of the property and white goods? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many sellers will try to get you to up your offer by throwing in things to the deal such as white goods. Try not to be overly influenced by this. It’s worth remembering that unless they are almost brand new, within warranty and have guarantees that are transferrable, white goods tend to be worth very little. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">Should I do this myself or should my solicitor look after this? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Usually your solicitor will conduct any further negotiations relating to the deal however, whether you’re negotiating on a price for the property or for additional extras sometimes it can be helpful to speak directly with the sellers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Be warned, agents and solicitors are usually against this but negotiating in person can be a more straightforward approach. And if you click with the owner it could work out even better. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">What about legal fees – can I negotiate on those too? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can’t usually negotiate but you can shop around and it’s essential that you do so. Choosing the wrong solicitor can cost you hundreds of pounds.

However, a serious backlash would arrive if owners of relatively modern Euro 5 diesel cars were hammered.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's without doubt that diesel cars will  be a focal point of the government's push to reduce emissions, though. So if you own a two-to-six year old car that has retained plenty of its original value, you might want to part with it sooner rather than later to negate any further dips in used values. This is certainly the case if you live or drive frequently in London where surcharges already exist.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you own a much older diesel car that's worth very little on the second-hand market, it might be worth holding onto it to see what incentives are offered as part of the scrappage scheme that seems more and more likely to happen.

If you already own buy-to-lets and want to transfer them to a limited company you will trigger a sale and repurchase, incurring capital gains tax, stamp duty plus the surcharge plus legal, valuation and mortgage fees.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2. Companies have running costs, incur corporation tax and potentially business rates, require accounts to be formally filed and directors to be appointed. Board meetings have to take place and liability is assigned. This creates an added layer of responsibility for landlords choosing the limited company route. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">3. While some lenders price buy-to-let mortgage rates consistently for personal owners and limited company purchases, on the whole, rates for limited companies are higher and they incur higher fees. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">4. The tax implications are complicated depending on whether and how you earn any other income. Everyone's personal tax liability will be different so it's really worth getting independent tax advice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">5. Dividends are subject to a different tax regime from earned income and have recently attracted the attention of the Chancellor who had indicated the tax-free dividend would fall next year from £5,000 to £2,000. This follows recent hikes to the tax rate on dividends. However, following confirmation of a snap general election in June, this policy proposal has been dropped for the moment from the Finance Bill. <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="" href="/money/pensions/article-4443428/Cuts-pension-dividend-allowances-hold-now.html">Read more here</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">6. The rules governing buy-to-let are not set in stone and could change again in the future if the Government wishes. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whatever you decide to do, it is a good idea to get independent financial advice <strong>AND</strong> independent tax advice. Mortgage brokers are qualified to find you the best mortgage but that doesn't mean they are qualified to give you tax advice. For this, you'll need a specialist accountant. <strong> </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Rob Bence, is a landlord himself and is also co-founder of investor forum The Property Hub. He gives his view on your situation: </strong></p><img id="i-3f0cc8bd25b79356" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/24/17/3F90A90D00000578-0-image-a-2_1493051585503.jpg" height="272" width="306" alt="Bence: Landlords too quick to see ltd company buy-to-let as the easy option" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In my opinion, you're right not wanting to move into a limited company. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the former chancellor George Osborne announced plans to introduce cuts to landlord tax relief back in 2015 the limited company route was touted as the panacea. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, thousands of landlords have now opted for this route - latest figures from Countrywide show a fifth of all buy-to-lets are now held by company landlords. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I think many were too quick to see this as the easy option. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The limited company route is not without its flaws. You would have to pay capital gains tax on any capital growth and although you have an allowance it's unlikely to cover that. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s also stamp duty to consider. You’d effectively have to buy the properties as a limited company from yourself as an individual so you’d be liable for stamp duty, including the 3 per cent surcharge. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You'd have all the administration work of setting the company up and managing its accounts. Furthermore, while there are more limited company mortgages coming to market, they do tend to be priced at higher rates than individual mortgages.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The most important thing to do it to understand how your tax position will change. Will you move into a higher tax threshold or will you stay below? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now that landlords will pay tax on their income, not just their profits, many are being pushed into higher tax brackets. If this is the case you’ll want to reassess your portfolio.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Do your sums. Once the full tax burden is in place (it is being phased in and won’t be fully in play until 2020) will all of your buy-to-lets be profitable?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Consider selling any properties that don't cover their costs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Look at all your mortgages and make sure they are the best products available to you. Cash flow is now more important than ever and looking at your mortgages is one way of improving this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’re going to remortgage look to lenders that have a transitional arrangement in place. Mortgage criteria is currently tighter than ever for buy-to-let as a result of new rules from the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority. </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">These rules mean lenders are implementing stricter stress tests and landlords are required to prove they can secure higher rents in order to access funds. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The PRA has however allowed lenders to put in place transitional arrangements meaning borrowers can remortgage under the criteria that was in place before the new rules came into play. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In other words you can take out a mortgage at a lower rental coverage calculation. Not all lenders are making the most of this but Ipswich Building Society recently became the latest lender to do so.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s worth noting however that most buy-to-let lenders will only lend up to 75 per cent loan-to-value. Leveraging beyond 82 per cent - as you are - will be difficult and expensive as products with a higher LTV also come with a higher rate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Consider using your spouse to limit your taxes. This is not as Machiavellian as it sounds. If your spouse doesn't work then using his or her tax allowance would be worth looking into.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finally, make sure you are aware of any tax deductible expenses. Mortgage broker fees and lender arrangement fees, for example, are tax deductible as are any funds spent on repairs or maintenance.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Limited company buy-to-let is in vogue - largely down to several structural changes to the way buy-to-let income, gains and purchases are taxed.

While equivalent data is not available from councils, they pocket at least £750million from a combination of car parking charges and fines.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Parking campaigner Barrie Segal, who runs website AppealNow, says: ‘They are the modern-day version of Dick Turpin, acting like outlaws by making outrageously unfair penalty demands. It is a huge money-spinner for them.’ Key to the success of many car park operators is the use of bullying tactics.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you pay up in 14 days, they say, the penalty amount will be halved, panicking most motorists to foot the bill rather than fight a charge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is also the threat of sending debt collectors round if a fine goes unpaid, though bailiffs cannot go knocking on a door without first going to court. What the parking attendants fail to reveal is that half of motorists who fight a fine eventually win. But you must arm yourself with information and have the stomach for a fight.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-dce840a0-2ce9-11e7-8d51-0d6fac3ef1ac">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Got a ticket?

If you do, you are effectively admitting responsibility.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While half of all appeals succeed, be prepared for a lengthy process.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jeanette Miller is managing director of national motoring law specialist Geoffrey Miller Solicitors. She says: ‘It rarely pays to hire a lawyer in cases involving disputed car parking fines. But if you are aware of the law and do your homework it will boost your chances of success.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She points out that The Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 was introduced to stamp out car clamping. But as a concession to the car park operators, it paved the way for private firms to chase motorists using details gleaned from the DVLA.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999, any sums demanded must be deemed ‘fair and reasonable’. But this still means an £85 fine for overstaying by a few minutes might be deemed fair in a court of law if it is seen as a legitimate deterrent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Miller, president of the Association of Motor Offence Lawyers, adds: ‘Take time to prepare a case, do not just get angry. Revisit the car park, take photos, write targeted letters and be prepared to attend court.’</p></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>PARKING CHARGE NOTICE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Motorists fined for overstaying a paid-for period or parking without permission on private land are issued with a ‘parking charge notice’. If a motorist wants to challenge the fine, they can take up their argument with the car park firm. If it will not listen, motorists must seek redress through arbitration.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the company is a member of the British Parking Association, such as NCP, drivers can contact Parking on Private Land Appeals within 28 days.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alternatively, the car park operator might be a member of the International Parking Community, in which case someone disputing a fine must take it to the Independent Appeals Service.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Car park firms not affiliated to a trade group will find it harder to chase you for a fine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In theory, only members of the British Parking Association and International Parking Community should be able to track you down through the Driver &amp; Vehicle Licensing Agency database.</p><img id="i-b0385664deae60e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/29/21/16596CF1000005DC-4458446-image-a-15_1493496469876.jpg" height="458" width="306" alt="Parking fines: You have 28 days to appeal" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>PENALTY CHARGE NOTICE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A car parking fine on council-owned land is known as a ‘penalty charge notice’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The process of appeal is more structured than for parking on private land. Motorists have 14 days to argue their case with the council, after which it will issue a ‘notice to owner’ for those intent on continuing to fight their case.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Motorists then get a further 28 days to make a formal representation. If the appeal is rejected, a ‘notice of rejection’ is issued. Those intent on battling their case can then go to an adjudicator.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In England and Wales this is the Traffic Penalty Tribunal. In Scotland it is the Parking and Bus Lane Tribunal for Scotland while in Northern Ireland it is the Traffic Penalty Tribunal (Northern Ireland).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the capital there is a separate institution – London Tribunals. You have 28 days to argue your case with the appropriate tribunal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Poorly marked signs:</strong> The car park firm must prove all signs were clearly visible and that the parking rules were marked out and not obscured – for example, by trees or poor night lighting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If markings on a bay were rubbed out, this can help in disputing a fine if it is issued for being in the wrong spot.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ticket not visible: </strong>If you had a valid ticket but it fell off the dashboard or was upside down you can present this as evidence. Councils are more likely to accept this argument than private firms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Three-minute rule:</strong> If you get a ticket in the first three minutes after arriving you can argue that you had gone to find a machine to buy one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>A broken car park machine: </strong>If the ticket machine is out of order it is up to you to see if there is another one in the car park. If you cannot find one take a photo of the broken equipment as proof.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Emergency stop</strong>: If you can offer evidence of a breakdown or other mitigating circumstance, such as pulling over for health reasons or to help someone in trouble, this may help your cause. A doctor’s certificate can help if you are caught ill.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>A legal technicality:</strong> A private firm is not issuing an official fine but notice for a breach of contract.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You might therefore ask to see the contract between the company and landowner to see if it is watertight. A firm must prove it correctly issued a charge.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-a3aec5c0-2d16-11e7-a021-e9e369ab5d6b">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Speeding fines rocket to 175 per cent of weekly salary </h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">New guidelines were rolled out last week allowing police to hit motorists in England and Wales with speeding tickets up to 175 per cent of their weekly salary.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Offenders can also expect six points on their driving licence or up to a 56-day driving ban.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">They also earn a fee if you choose to use the in-house adviser, which is why they can seem pushy. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That said, most in-house brokers will still give you mortgage advice based on your personal needs and should recommend the right mortgage for you having looked at a whole range of lenders. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Independent advice </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Independent advisers usually focus more on investment and pension advice than mortgages, and so are likely to refer you to another adviser in their firm who specialises in mortgages - or in some cases, onto another firm of mortgage brokers altogether. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Again, the same thing applies - if a mortgage broker is independent then they are legally bound to review a range of lenders in the marketplace and recommend the best deal for you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By no means true in all cases, but a rule of thumb tends to be that you're likely to get a personal level of service from an independent broker who relies on word of mouth for recommendations and to stay in business.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By contrast, brokers who get all their clients through an estate agent, might view you more as a means to an end. There are always going to be great advisers who are exceptions to this rule though - just as there may be ones who treat you as a statistic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Choosing an adviser really ought to come down to their fees, whether they review a broad enough number of lenders and finally - do you get on with them? You're likely to have to talk to them a lot.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Online </strong></p><img id="i-6632b3678d2b6a9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/13/16/326F4CE800000578-4335932-image-a-4_1492095656357.jpg" height="207" width="306" alt="Trussle, Habito and Dwell are just three that allow you to put your details in online on your mobile" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Online, you can search price comparison websites for the best rates on offer. But be aware that many of these sites earn commission from lenders and where there is no commercial relationship with a lender, they may just not include their mortgages in the table.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rates they display are also the 'best buy' rates and not necessarily the rate you personally would get from the lender once you've applied. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Online mortgage brokers are also available - Trussle, Habito and Dwell are just three that allow you to put your details in online on your mobile and then an adviser (behind the scenes) will recommend the right deal for you. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Traditional route </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finally, you can go to your bank or building society - nearly all of which still have some branches  - but will allow you to arrange a mortgage either face-to-face, online or over the phone. They will only tell you about the mortgages they're offering though and have no obligation to tell you about cheaper rates available from another bank across the road. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Choice creates competition and, while it can be complicated to navigate, it's a large part of the reason that mortgage rates are so low.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><span class="">To give you a bit more information, we've asked a specialist mortgage lender and a broker to share their views. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class=""><strong>The lender view </strong></span><strong></strong></p><img id="i-170b3deb100313a8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/03/21/16/3E7F09CC00000578-0-image-a-3_1490114421615.jpg" height="374" width="306" alt="Thomson: Mortgage lending done by the smaller specialists grew at ten times the rate of the banks’ lending last year" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Pete Thomson, of challenger  The Mortgage Lender, replies: </strong>The days of popping down to your high street bank to find the best mortgage deal are long gone, not least because of branch closures.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it’s not surprising you’re being given different advice by people around you. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your friends are biased towards searching online, possibly because of their generational experience, and your parents are recommending an independent adviser because of their life experience.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When considering which way to go it’s important to understand the choices available and how to navigate them. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s also worth looking beyond the high street to the new and specialist lenders. Last year the amount of mortgage lending done by the smaller specialists grew at ten times the rate of the banks’ lending, as more and more borrowers seem to be realising the value these specialist lenders can offer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s a perception that banks and building societies are over-reliant on computers to make lending decisions and that there is no room for flexibility in criteria, which is a problem when you consider the way we are working and earning money today.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">People often like the service they get from brokers and feel they are three times more likely to get the best mortgage deal for their circumstances when compared to the high street.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before you choose a broker you should know two things: whether they charge a fee for their advice, and if they are able to advise on the whole mortgage market. Mortgage brokers can be tied to one or several lenders, or they can advise on the full range of products that are available direct to consumers and brokers, this is known as 'whole of market'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What you can save depends on your circumstances and the loan amount but there are big savings to be made on monthly payments and fees by using a broker. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, if you have a 25 per cent deposit, are self-employed and looking for a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, Newcastle Building society offers a rate of 2.20 per cent. But Halifax offers a two-year fixed-rate at just 1.24 per cent through broker network, Intrinsic. This would be over £100 cheaper each month on a £225,000 loan.</p><img id="i-9f461ced206e7c7d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/13/15/3104568000000578-4335932-image-a-1_1492095562533.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="The best rates are only available to people who meet lenders’ criteria and without knowing those criteria it’s impossible to guess if you will qualify" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-large">The broker view </span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ray Boulger, senior technical manager at mortgage broker John Charcol, replies:</strong> Many lenders operate on a 'computer says no' basis, which means that to them things are black or white but never grey.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite the issues with the high street, your existing bank or building society could be a good place for you to start your research. What they are prepared to lend you at and at what rate is a good benchmark for further research.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A trip to a comparison site will also allow you to see what kind of products and rates are available from a range of different lenders. But they won’t give you a complete overview because the sites only show lenders that have paid to be featured.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, even if the rates quoted look great, don’t assume you will qualify for it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The best rates are only available to people who meet lenders’ criteria and without knowing those criteria it’s impossible to guess if you will qualify.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are a myriad of factors to take into account before selecting the right product and the right lender but understanding which lenders’ criteria a borrower is likely to meet is a good starting point.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A lender is effectively offering a choice of one. Some brokers, especially estate agents, operate from only a small choice of lenders. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A good independent mortgage broker can choose from the whole market, which is why savvy borrowers recognise the value a good independent mortgage broker can offer. Brokers are also recommended if your income circumstances are complex, or one partner is self-employed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With a really complex set of circumstances a good independent mortgage broker is not just likely to find a better deal for their client but, in many cases, one that makes the difference between actually being offered a mortgage or being rejected.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>We are looking to move home and I want the best deal on our mortgage but I’m getting conflicting advice from different people.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Imagine, say, a bank that provides customers with an experience that doesn’t involve queuing for your entire lunchtime to talk to a crook in a suit, whose job is to up-sell pointless payment protection insurance (PPI) and give to you it anyway when you refuse.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Imagine no more.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the last few months the likes of Starling, Atom and Monzo have been snorting up banking licences like there is a tomorrow after all, to make banks that exist nowhere else but on the phone in your pocket.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They’ve even managed to create a buzz about financial products. The thing is, they’re all, well, rather too buzzy, or in English, gimmicky.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don’t get me wrong, banks have always used gimmicks to attract customers.

Millennials, apparently, love them. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I maybe old enough to remember when we got our first colour TV in the 1970s but I’m still young enough, thankfully, to remember how exciting it was to view a world previously only available in black, white and mostly grey.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the internet first came along, that same excitement beamed down all over again. It was as magical as trying to understand email for the first time was baffling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I feel sorry for millennials. It’s all always been there.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Email’s only ever been a chore, Facebook‘s a bore and Twitter’s where you  scrawl what you once etched into the school desk and toilet cubicle wall. [Hat tip, Doc Brown]. Snapchat is the benchmark. It’s all they’ve got.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But recently colleagues and about-town millennials have been getting genuinely excited about a new technology. Not, say, Tesla, the exciting battery-power sports car, or the latest GoPro cameras you wear on your head when you jump out of planes and space shuttles – but a bank! </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Young people are getting excited about a bank. This I had to try.</p><img id="i-24ff7aefa4f1489" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/03/30/14/0D28FFA500000578-4347144-image-m-17_1490880919302.jpg" height="117" width="306" alt="Egg on face. Fined for PPI mis-selling, the once trendy internet-only bank vanished.  " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’d tried First Direct, the phone-up bank, when it launched nearly 30 years ago and I’m still with it. Its call centres are still pretty good even if it doesn’t offer much else in the way of attractive accounts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’d tried one of the wacky new internet-only banks, Egg, when it launched in the 90s. That lot kindly added PPI after I’d told them not to before they went on to get fined for mis-selling PPI and quietly vanishing into the banking footnotes of Wikipedia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I also tried the recent, exciting challenger bank, Metro.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Metro’s a mystery to me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was great for a while — then it limited its worldwide fee-free cash withdrawals to Europe presumably once it remembered it was a bank and needed to make money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But its website was terrible — a kind of free off-the-shelf DIY affair you wouldn’t bother paying for when the trial came to an end.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And that slogan, ‘No stupid bank rules’ — subverted by its own stupid rule of only locating branches on prominent street corners with enough space in front of the counter for a nightclub dancefloor or five-a-side football pitch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That seems like one hell of an expensive gimmick in a world where people apparently no longer want branches. Or do they? Let's find out. </p><img id="i-7902bd828d34dc0f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/07/10/1FE84B4A00000578-4347144-Cornering_the_market_in_location_at_least_Newish_challenger_bank-a-2_1491558042359.jpg" height="447" width="634" alt="Cornering the market in location at least.

But they do have enough cards. Which one is it? Bank trick number one?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I decide not to lure anyone else into this and wait. About a week later I’m granted access.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Week 2, Thursday</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unlike any other bank I’ve joined, it feels like a leap into the unknown.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The big fear is what happens to my money when I send it to an icon on my phone that could disappear as quickly as it downloaded.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To get started you need to send £100 to app land.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The app invites me to scan a debit card from another of my bank accounts — one I’m already perfectly happy with — to send cash to this one. It feels a bit pointless.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The trade-off is Monzo’s free cash withdrawals throughout the world.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Everyone should pay the same official Visa or Mastercard exchange rate when using cards abroad. But most providers add at least a couple of per cent as a fee on top. Some have other fixed fees on top of that. Monzo doesn’t. That's amazing. But remember, Metro didn’t to start with. Bank trick number two?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As instructed, I hold my debit card up to a window on my phone, which scans it. I tap in the expiry date and the three-digit security code.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The app tells me I have sent £100 but need to ‘enable notifications’. Then the app freezes. Has my hundred quid arrived or not? I mess about in the phone settings and change notifications manually. I go back to the app to check if the transfer has been as success. It doesn’t say.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, it urges me to send an animation of a debit card sitting in a boat to my friends. I don’t have any friends who want one of those.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The page it wants me to share to friends on social media has my home address clearly displayed on it. Does Monzo really want me to post my address to Twitter and Facebook? I’m confused. I realise I'm already on the ‘activate card page’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the way to find out if my money has arrived is by activating my card. But I can’t activate a card I applied for a few minutes ago. It will arrive in the post on Saturday. I close the app and reopen it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This time I’m greeted with another animated debit card. This one appears to be running away — with my hundred quid? Not pleased. The idea of sending large sums of money to app banks would be terrifying.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Week 2, Saturday</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The bright orange card arrives in the post as promised. I don’t need to be in to sign for it, which is a bonus.</p><img id="i-c0ef1b9f5b6dcbb9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/03/30/14/3EC751FA00000578-4347144-image-a-21_1490881791794.jpg" height="440" width="586" alt="The future is bright, the future is orangey. Or is it?" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Given that the app has encouraged me to share Lord only knows what with the internet, it comes with a peculiar bold warning in the envelope: do not post your card number online.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Does Monzo think its customers are morons? It will go far as a proper bank after all. The rest of the process is easy and works first go. I activate the card and am reunited with my missing 100 pounds.</p><img id="i-5841d13cfcbc207c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/03/30/18/3EC751BC00000578-4347144-image-m-23_1490895764547.jpg" height="466" width="586" alt="Weyhey! Finally the money arrived and I could see it in the account." class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I make some test purchases. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I buy a smoothie in Waitrose to see what millennial feels like and offset it with a sausage roll from a stand across the road because I’m Northern.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The purchases are logged and immediately categorised. The smoothie is classed as grocery and the sausage roll as eating out. I like that. You also get a little map to remind you exactly where you bought it in case you’d had eight pints before buying a smoothie, I mean sausage roll.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Overall my experiences with the card and app have been excellent. But is it for me?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The good stuff</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No money went missing. The transfer arrived safely even though I was left in limbo for a couple of days.  When you spend money you see what you’ve spent immediately in the app with a little map of where you were geographically. I like maps.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The chatline people answer questions quickly. Spending is categorised so you can see how much you’re flitting away on needless snacks.</p><img id="i-8fadbead8398d8b1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/03/30/18/3EC7E0F700000578-4347144-image-a-18_1490895478764.jpg" height="496" width="306" alt="I bought a smoothie in Waitrose." class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-fd73257658d66ce9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/03/30/18/3EC7E0E500000578-4347144-image-m-17_1490895459508.jpg" height="496" width="306" alt="I paid for a motorway toll in France." class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can’t go overdrawn.

But it’s so easy to top up again from your other account that I’m not sure that stands up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fans say it's great for sending money to each other for sharing bills and the like. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The not so good</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I went to Morrisons the supermarket and the card was refused – some shops have different technology, I was told by the chatline people. That’s fine – the product is still in development, but if I load up my card for a foreign trip and it doesn’t work while I‘m away then its game over.</p><img id="i-c59514af18a966d4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/03/30/18/3EC7E0DB00000578-4347144-image-m-21_1490895528530.jpg" height="527" width="306" alt="Agggh. It's not without its glitches. The card was rejected in a supermarket. Can you rely on it abroad?" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ‘buzz’ it has created among fans is incomprehensible to me. There’s a forum for fans to help Monzo create the perfect bank. Customers are tweeting about how exciting the app is. Is this really as exciting as first getting colour TV and the internet?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No, it's not.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Monzo mission is to build ‘a financial control centre for everyone in the world’. Wow!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The hubris behind the marketing is overwhelming and frankly detracts, possibly deliberately, from the fact that it is a bank. And banks end up greedy and corrupt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Oh yeah, it isn’t really a bank. Not yet. It’s a pre-paid debit card with some impressive nobs on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It doesn’t appear to have a business plan to recoup the millions of pounds of investment without becoming everything in banking it’s striving not to be.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What happens when it turns into a lender that hits customers with charges and its fans start to use the forums and social media to tear it to shreds remains to be seen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s very good at what it does now. There is a real danger that as it adds more features in a bid to ‘improve’ it will complicate the app to the point of destruction. It’s a start-up. It’s what they do.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Is it for me?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not yet. It was fun to try and I’ll check it out when it’s a bank.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m sick of banks.

One of the funds we like in this area is the Artemis offering, managed by Peter Saacke and Raheel Altaf, using the firm's "SmartGARP" approach. The fund is not too big and cumbersome, which gives it added flexibility to invest across the emerging markets spectrum, and it has a strong team behind it. We think it is a good option for playing the improvement in emerging market fundamentals.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Adventurous</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="http://webfund6.financialexpress.net/clients/dailymail/FundFactsheet.aspx?CitiCode=TZ88"><strong>Baillie Gifford Shin Nippon Trust</strong></a></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Ongoing charges: 1.24%</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Shin Nippon means ‘new Japan’ and this trust focuses on emerging or disrupted sectors, where the manager sees innovative growth opportunities, says FundCalibre’s Darius McDermott. ‘Baillie Gifford Shin Nippon Trust invests in smaller and medium sized companies and, in the last 10 years, the trust has been geared every year in a range between 9% and 18%, which can increase the risk further.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Barrie Segal, founder of parkingticketexpert.com and appealnow.com, says: 'They are known as 'fluttering ticket cases' and we hear batches of them. Drivers rarely win because councils have strict rules on how tickets must be displayed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Councils should be made to refund the amount the driver paid to park — otherwise, they are just profiting twice — but there's no fairness or logic to any of this.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When you first appeal a parking fine, the council investigates and decides if it was fairly issued.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If it rejects your appeal, you can take your case to an independent parking adjudicator — usually a lawyer. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 50 per cent of cases, drivers win — but not when it comes to fluttering tickets. In these cases, the adjudicator typically sides with the council, says Mr Segal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is because councils have explicit rules that state parking tickets must be displayed clearly. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, legally, drivers have little protection. But it is still worth appealing, as you can occasionally succeed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Segal recalls a case where a driver had stuck a parking slip to their window, but the sun melted the adhesive and the ticket fell on to the floor. When challenged, the council agreed that the adhesive was not strong enough and cancelled the fine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Janet Tibbetts had driven from Formby, on Merseyside, to Southport to go shopping and paid £1.40 to park in the town centre.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But when she returned half-an-hour later, she found a £50 penalty charge notice on her windscreen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Janet, 59, took her ticket from the dashboard to the council parking office to ask why she had been fined.
