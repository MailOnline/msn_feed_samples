'People open up to him and, in doing so, often reveal more about their hometowns or homelands than a traditional reporter could hope to document.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While accepting the award in 2014, Bourdain explained the ethos of the show. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We ask very simple questions: What makes you happy?

And everywhere in the world we go and ask these very simple questions, we tend to get some really astonishing answers,' he said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Season 11 of the show premiered last month, and has featured episodes on West Virginia, Uruguay, Newfoundland, Armenia and Hong Kong.

The memoir also detailed his struggles with drug abuse, which led many to describe him as a 'rockstar chef' and a 'culinary bad boy'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He became a household name by hosting such shows as A Cook's Tour and No Reservations, which blended his love of food and travel. No Reservations was his break-out hit, catapulting him to national fame and earning him two Emmy Awards. The show ran from 2005 to 2012, when he let the Travel Channel for CNN. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At CNN, Bourdain traveled to lesser-known places for Parts Unknown, a show that was acclaimed for its cinematography and earned him a Peabody Award. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He's irreverent, honest, curious, never condescending, never obsequious,' the judges said of Bourdain at the time. 'People open up to him and, in doing so, often reveal more about their hometowns or homelands than a traditional reporter could hope to document.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While accepting the award in 2014, Bourdain explained the ethos of the show. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We ask very simple questions: What makes you happy? What do you eat? What do you like to cook? And everywhere in the world we go and ask these very simple questions, we tend to get some really astonishing answers,' he said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Season 11 of the show premiered last month, and has featured episodes on West Virginia, Uruguay, Newfoundland, Armenia and Hong Kong. The Hong Kong episode was directed by Argento. </p><img id="i-dfe597efa5b7dbc6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/17/4D0D6EAD00000578-5821039-Last_week_Bourdain_bought_a_painting_by_artist_John_Lurie_with_t-m-112_1528476823943.jpg" height="351" width="470" alt="Last week, Bourdain bought a painting by artist John Lurie with the ominous title 'The sky is falling, I am learning to live with it'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-20f88aac6bd4b8d0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/21/4D0D597000000578-5821039-Bourdain_s_last_post_on_Instagram_was_four_days_ago_and_showed_h-a-150_1528491446387.jpg" height="351" width="470" alt="Bourdain's last post on Instagram was four days ago, and showed him tucking into a traditional Alsace meal of meat, potatoes and sauerkraut" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">While Bourdain's TV career seemed to be better than ever, he had suffered one business failure recently.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the past two years, the chef had been working on 'Bourdain Market' - a Singapore-style food hall planned for New York City's Pier 57 development.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But in December, he told <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://ny.eater.com/2017/12/22/16812274/bourdain-market-nyc-canceled">Eater</a> that the market had been cancelled. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Launching what is admittedly a very ambitious venture has proven to be challenging at every turn,' he said.
