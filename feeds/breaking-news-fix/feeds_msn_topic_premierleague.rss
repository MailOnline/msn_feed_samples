</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brighton and West Brom, his main potential suitors, have the capacity to offer him remuneration likely to be beyond Celtic's reach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For former Celtic skipper Tom Boyd, though, the player's choice is becoming abundantly clear.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'What do you want to be as a player?' he asked. 'Do you want to be a winner? Or do you want to just earn good money?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I really hope Stuart can stay at Celtic. We don't want our best players leaving.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I know in the grand scheme of things there's a big gap between the Scottish Premiership and the English Premiership. And he clearly has a decision to make.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But I don't want to see Stuart go. Hopefully we can get him to stay - a five year contract would be nice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think he's a happy man at Celtic. He'll win things there.' His medal haul to date isn't too shabby, though. Four titles, two Scottish Cups, two League Cups - have all been attained in three-and-a-half years.</p><img id="i-b3b31d529ca196aa" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D25431500000578-0-image-a-26_1528761173837.jpg" height="415" width="634" alt="Former Celtic skipper Tom Boyd has urged the 26-year-old to stay at Celtic Park" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps, for Celtic, therein lies the problem. Success may not have come easy to the former Dundee United player but he's enjoyed it so quickly and to such an extent that he might feel the need for a challenge elsewhere.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And if it comes to pass that the player and his current paymasters come to an amicable agreement, shake hands and move on, Boyd feels the depth of the squad he'd leave behind would cope.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Celtic are well covered in the midfield areas,' he said. 'If something was to happen, that Stuart decides to leave, then we've certainly got a lot of other options.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We've got good players in there; (Callum) McGregor and (Tom) Rogic - similarly attack minded boys.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But, we don't want a player like that to leave and what he brings to the football club. He's got great drive and ability and we'd rather see him here.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'At the moment, where it lies, if somebody was to come in and make a good offer then there needs to be serious consideration.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But he's still a Celtic player and hopefully he will stay a Celtic player.' Brendan Rodgers could certainly do with Armstrong remaining on board at least for the duration of the Champions League qualifiers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Set to face the first of four hurdles on July 10/11, the Celtic manager faces an appreciably tougher task to take his side into the group stages than in the past two years.</p><img id="i-e69ead556ac9b5aa" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D231F1100000578-0-image-m-23_1528760727496.jpg" height="819" width="634" alt="Boyd hopes the Scottish champions can keep ahold of Armstrong and offer him a new deal" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There's so much against Celtic in terms of qualifying,' Boyd offered.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They've now got four rounds to overcome and that's a massive ask.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Hopefully they do well. But we need all of the other Scottish clubs to get better. It helps the coefficient. Ultimately, that can stop Celtic from having to play four qualifying rounds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We need Scottish football to get better and I think the signs are there we can.' With Steven Gerrard in at Rangers, Alan Stubbs the new manager of St Mirren, and Neil Lennon, Steve Clarke and Derek McInnes remaining in charge at Hibs, Kilmarnock and Aberdeen, Boyd envisages the forthcoming domestic campaign being compelling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The competition in the league is improving,' he said. 'I know Celtic are still the strongest side but things are getting better.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The Steven Gerrard factor is unknown at the moment. Hearts should also be better. Hibs did ever so well last year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So we hope Scottish football can keep on the rise and get the country back on the map in terms of Europe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We've seen it so many times in recent years, clubs being knocked out in the first round of qualifiers; clubs from countries like Estonia and even last year, Luxembourg.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'To get better, to stop us having so many qualifiers, we need to achieve better results. It means everybody - it can't just be one team delivering.' </p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">GOALS' summer Football Revolution campaign aims to get more people active through playing five-a-side football during the World Cup and beyond. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">For further information: www.goalsfootball.co.uk [http://www.goalsfootball.co.uk]</span></p><div>

Kluivert, who was heavily linked with a transfer to Manchester United, has reportedly made the move from Ajax to last season's Champions League semi-finalists for £15.85m. The 19-year-old was greeted by about 500 Roma fans at Fiumicino Airport on Monday evening. The club announced the news on their Twitter account.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Tom Farmery</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-12T09:50:01.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Manchester United target Justin Kluivert signs for Roma</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-12T09:50:01.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Transfer News,Premier League,Manchester United,Serie A,Jose Mourinho,Champions League</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5831895/Manchester-United-face-Bayern-Munich-away-final-pre-season-test.html" title="Manchester United to face Bayern Munich away in final pre-season test"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5633453/Premier-League-Kits-2018-19.html" title="Premier League Kits 2018-19: Find out the latest strips to be worn by Man United, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and all other teams for next season"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5633343/Premier-League-Transfers-Club-club-list-Summer-2018-moves.html" title="Premier League transfer window: Latest club-by-club football guide of summer moves in 2018"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5830727/Kleberson-reveals-Ronaldinho-convinced-join-Manchester-United.html" title="Kleberson reveals Ronaldinho convinced him to join Manchester United: 'He told me he was going to Old Trafford... but he didn't'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.espn.co.uk/" title="ESPN: The Worldwide Leader in Sports"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://twitter.com/OfficialASRoma/status/1006281757736472576" title="AS Roma on Twitter: &quot;Justin Kluivert 🛬 https://t.co/4IcKHPP635&quot;"></link></item><item><title>Arsenal in talks to sign Sampdoria £22m midfielder Lucas Torreira who is with Uruguay for the World Cup</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5831977/Arsenal-talks-sign-Sampdoria-22m-midfielder-Lucas-Torreira.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2018 18:14:59 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5831977</guid><description><![CDATA[The 22-year-old Uruguay international has emerged as a preferred option for Unai Emery who wants a defensive midfielder brought in as part of his summer recruitment plan.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

He encourages any English player to do the same in reverse; experience living in a foreign culture.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Daniel Matthews</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-09T11:05:39.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Sebastian Prodl on London, England and the family kitchen business</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-09T11:05:39.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>World Cup 2018,England Football,Premier League,Austria Football,Watford</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5633117/Premier-League-fixtures-results-pre-season-2018.html" title="Premier League pre-season 2018 fixtures and results: Keep track of your side’s progress during the break including Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and the other teams"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5633343/Premier-League-Transfers-Club-club-list-Summer-2018-moves.html" title="Premier League transfer window: Latest club-by-club football guide of summer moves in 2018"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5816729/Russia-head-World-Cup-lowest-ranked-dropping-Saudi-Arabia-70th.html" title="Hosts Russia head into World Cup as lowest-ranked side after dropping below Saudi Arabia into 70th as England find themselves joint-12th"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5815771/Raheem-Sterling-turned-late-went-easy-criticising-doesnt-make-racist-bully.html" title="MARTIN SAMUEL: Raheem Sterling turned up late and went down easy - criticising him for it doesn't make you a racist bully... luckily his own attitude towards his mistakes is more mature"></link></item><item><title>Richard Scudamore on stepping down as Premier League executive chairman: 'I was 39 when I got the job, you don't want to do it when you're 60'</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5823297/Richard-Scudamore-39-got-job-dont-want-youre-60.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2018 23:29:22 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5823297</guid><description><![CDATA[Richard Scudamore announced earlier this week he will be leaving his position as executive chairman at the end of the year after almost two decades spent in the Premier League's top job.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Premier League clubs on Thursday struck a new deal over sharing future revenue from international broadcast deals, with future increases divided according to league position. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Scudamore waited for that wrangle to be agreed before announcing he would be stepping down from his role later this year after almost 20 years in charge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'A number of the clubs were palpably relieved that this has been resolved; we've been at it for four years,' said Scudamore. 'It's been difficult and challenging as all the executives at the clubs get on pretty well together.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There are good friends, and partnerships and friendships around that table that I don't understand and you wouldn't understand either.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The executives who attend are friends, even if they are on opposite sides of the argument. And it was a big issue in the way of normal dealings. It was great that we don't have to talk about that again now. That was a general view.</p><img id="i-89663e90019295b1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/00/4D052F9100000578-5823297-image-a-100_1528500077104.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Premier League executive chairman Scudamore said he didn't need to defend his record" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He added: 'I'll concentrate now on the rest of the international rights process. Hopefully we'll get that completed by December, then I'll spend Christmas in the sunshine somewhere.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When I joined our turnover was £160million. We will give away £460million this year. The biggest of the banks don't get anywhere near it. I don't know what greed means really. I'm proud of this, I don't have to defend it.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Premier League will also propose a code of conduct for agents in a crackdown on the practices of players' representatives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Senior Premier League officials will work with the Football Association to present a detailed set of recommendations to world governing body FIFA, which is examining ushering in new levels of regulations for agents.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The league wants agents to pass an exam to represent players in England, to hold a UK bank account and to submit annual financial reports to the FA detailing payments received.</p><img id="i-96d03c9fe195ef5f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/00/4D052EC900000578-5823297-image-a-101_1528500082154.jpg" height="424" width="634" alt="Scudamore said: 'I arrived in the job when I was 39, I don't want to be doing it when I'm 60'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Scudamore announced Premier League clubs reached consensus on the issue at this week's shareholders' meeting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We've been working for 18 months on what our clubs would like to do about agents,' said Scudamore. 'We want to boost administrative transparency and put the players at the centre of any transactions, to put the players more in control.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We've discussed a range of issues and we have reached a position to progress those ideas. So we're going to draft up rules on the basis of that, work this up very quickly and feed this into FIFA.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There is a suspicion that players sometimes see their net pay but they don't know what's gone on to get to that point. This is about making the player central to this process.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We have some strong views on this. This is what we'd like to see happen and this is what we'll feed in. We think we've got a contribution to make to that debate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think they will listen to us at least and give us fair hearing on this, because of the amount of market we are involved in. It would be worth FIFA listening.' </p><div>

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there are few inside the club who will claim their star striker does not deserve his incredible wage packet. Kane, who will lead England to the World Cup in Russia as captain, has scored 135 goals in the last four seasons at Tottenham.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In that time, he has claimed two Premier League Golden Boots, only missing out on a record-equalling his third consecutive top-scorer title due to Mohamed Salah's 34-goal haul for Liverpool. That is despite 2017-18 being his best return to date with 30 goals from 37 games.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is certainly more than Sanchez has done to justify his own excessive wages at Old Trafford. Since joining from Arsenal in January, the Chilean managed just three goals from his 18 appearances under Jose Mourinho.</p><img id="i-c83bff19acc77aef" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/12/4D017AB900000578-5821059-image-a-25_1528458337939.jpg" height="419" width="634" alt="Alexis Sanchez is the current highest-paid player in the Premier League at Manchester United" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-4a7b3ea849eef7f3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/12/4D02317100000578-5821059-image-a-26_1528458363718.jpg" height="432" width="634" alt="Arsenal and Germany playmaker Mesut Ozil signed a £300,000-a-week deal earlier this year" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It remains to be seen whether Kane's new deal is the exception to the rule or the start of a new era at the club. Chairman Daniel Levy has always maintained a strict wage structure at the club but they are looking to move into the elite levels of the game as they prepare to move to a state-of-the-art 62,000-seat stadium at White Hart Lane.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Toby Alderweireld and Mousa Dembele have both failed to agree terms due to to Levy's wage system. Tottenham expect to sell the duo this summer in order to avoid losing them for nothing when their current deals expire next summer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tottenham will use the funds generated from their sales to help pay for new deals for other significant stars.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">All this having once again played some of the most exhilarating football of any team in the Premier League, alongside City and Liverpool. Yet it was still only one League Cup in 19 years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And amid all that disappointment, there must have been another niggling concern this might actually be the best it would get. White Hart Lane had already been demolished but were the club's ambitions also about to come tumbling down?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Real Madrid were rumoured to be circling around manager Mauricio Pochettino, the architect of this exciting, young squad. Would he be tempted by one of the biggest managerial jobs in world football?</p><img id="i-ed1349d0988441d9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/14/4D0DBFA100000578-5821351-Harry_Kane_has_agreed_a_new_six_year_contract_with_Tottenham_ahe-a-63_1528465617920.jpg" height="366" width="634" alt="Harry Kane has agreed a new six-year contract with Tottenham ahead of the World Cup" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">His comments after the final game of the season hardly breathed confidence. 'I have very clear ideas of what we need to do but I don't know if the club will agree with me,' he said. 'If we want to be real contenders for big trophies... you need to be brave.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Because while Tottenham might have joined the elite when it comes to their style of football – they were one of only two teams to beat Real Madrid over 90 minutes in the Champions League – off the pitch they were nowhere near. And that was holding them back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And then there was the talisman, Harry Kane. He might be one of their own, but he is also one of the best strikers in the world. Chairman Daniel Levy's stringent wage structure meant Kane was the club's highest earner on £110,000 a week, a salary on par with Leicester striker Jamie Vardy. How strong would those heart strings hold up under the strain of bigger clubs offering much better wages?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tottenham's future among the big boys seemed in the balance.</p><img id="i-699c57fe44b3c0af" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/19/4D0DE3FB00000578-5821707-Kane_has_been_rewarded_and_will_become_the_Premier_League_s_seco-a-2_1528482567079.jpg" height="469" width="306" alt="Kane has been rewarded and will become the Premier League's second-best paid player" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-87ce581e4e1029be" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/19/05591B46000007D0-5821707-Mauricio_Pochettino_went_first_and_was_tied_down_to_a_new_8_5m_d-m-1_1528482561091.jpg" height="469" width="306" alt="Mauricio Pochettino went first and was tied down to a new £8.5m deal" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-df31953cd6abe214" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/14/4D075ECC00000578-5821351-image-m-12_1528463603398.jpg" height="583" width="634" alt="Kane's Spurs team-mate Dele Alli is also understood to be in talks with the north London club" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet from this position of precariousness, Spurs have taken that leap. Levy has been brave. And Spurs are now ready to put themselves among the elite.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">First, it was Pochettino. A new five-year contract, which took his salary from £5.5million a year to £8.5m. Even if he does keep flirting with Real Madrid following the resignation of Zinedine Zidane – 'a club that 100 per cent of coaches dream of managing one day' – Pochettino is happy at Tottenham for now and also does not want to be seen as a mercenary.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And now Kane has committed his future to the club. His new contract is expected to triple his wages to up to £300,000 a week. It's no longer Vardy who Kane is on par with, but behind only Manchester United forward Alexis Sanchez as the highest-paid footballer in the Premier League.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Spurs are no longer punching above their weight but paying salaries that justifies them being in the same ring as City and United.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">New deals for the influential pair Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen are expected to follow.</p><img id="i-4e8c570281f6e9e0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/15/4B480A6500000578-0-image-a-16_1524060936413.jpg" height="416" width="634" alt="Spurs also have a £1bn stadium on the way that will be bigger than Arsenal's Emirates Stadium" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">That's the manager sorted. And now the club's star players. There is also the none-too-small matter of the new stadium.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Spurs will move into the new White Hart Lane this season, a stadium on which they have spent the best part of £1bn to make it one of the most modern stadiums in the world. The capacity will increase from 36,284 to a shade over 62,000. That will make it the second-largest club stadium in the Premier League, behind only Old Trafford. And, maybe more importantly to Spurs fans, a grand or so more seats than the Emirates.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tottenham have spent so much of their recent existence in Arsenal's shadow. Now, they pay their top players more and have a bigger stadium.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The next step is to see this smashed financial structure translate into big-name signings. At the moment, Tottenham's record signing is centre-back Davinson Sanchez who cost £40m last summer. Before him, it was £30m flop Moussa Sissoko.</p><img id="i-dcbe4483111d6596" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/19/19D0C43A00000514-5821707-Daniel_Levy_has_been_brave_but_he_needs_to_push_on_and_make_big_-m-3_1528482626157.jpg" height="534" width="634" alt="Daniel Levy has been brave but he needs to push on and make big-name acquisitions" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sanchez has been a fine acquisition, and proven to be worth the cost. But Premier League giants make gigantic signings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To further challenge the Premier League goliaths, Spurs will have to spend more. United have just paid £52m for Fred, Liverpool are set to splash £53m on Nabil Fekir. In January, Arsenal spent nearly £60m on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang having bought Alexandre Lacazette for more than £50m in the summer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, it's Tottenham's turn to make the same statements in the transfer market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kane's contract, Pochettino's future, the new stadium, and the freshly-discarded purse strings have put Spurs, without question, among the elite Premier League clubs off the pitch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But that means that the excuses have gone, too. The financial disparity between Spurs and the rest can no longer be used as a safety net on which they can land if they fall short once again next season and the ones after that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Spurs are now on the same level as the biggest clubs in the Premier League. They must start to win the trophies to match.</p><div>

Chairman Daniel Levy has responded to the commitment made by manager Mauricio Pochettino, who only last month agreed a new five-year deal, by now securing the services of the club's best players as they prepare to move into a new state of the art stadium.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Amitai Winehouse</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-08T23:48:08.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Kane signs new six-year deal with Tottenham worth £90MILLION</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-08T23:48:08.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Harry Kane,Tottenham Hotspur,Premier League,Transfer News</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5822969/Liverpools-53m-Nabil-Fekir-stalls.html" title="Liverpool's £53m move for Nabil Fekir stalls as deal looks unlikely to be completed before World Cup"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5821177/Tottenham-confident-Harry-Kane-agree-long-term-deal.html" title="Tottenham confident Harry Kane will agree long-term deal as they prepare to smash wage structure to keep him"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5818157/England-2-0-Costa-Rica-Rashford-scores-sensational-long-range-effort-final-warm-friendly.html" title="England 2-0 Costa Rica: Marcus Rashford scores sensational long-range effort as Danny Welbeck heads home to secure Three Lions victory in final warm-up game before Russia World Cup"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5816977/Dele-Alli-refuses-rule-future-Tottenham-exit-insists-hes-happy-clubs-direction.html" title="'I'd never say never to anything:' Dele Alli refuses to rule out Tottenham exit in the future but insists he is happy with the club's direction"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5815967/Kane-Ozil-Mendy-Neymar-star-Beats-Dre-advert.html" title="Harry Kane sweats in the gym as Neymar plays poker in star-studded Beats by Dre World Cup advert... with cameos from Thierry Henry and Serena Williams"></link></item><item><title>EFL ditch extra-time from League Cup matches while penalty shootouts will revert to traditional format after the trial of ABBA during 2017-18</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5821269/EFL-ditch-extra-time-Carabao-Cup-matches-penalty-shootouts-revert-traditional-format.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2018 13:00:43 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5821269</guid><description><![CDATA[At the EFL's 2018 summer conference, clubs across the leagues have voted on a number of rule changes to next season's League Cup, most notably the removal of extra-time.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

When you compare Rashford's performance against Costa Rica with his average over 90 minutes for United last season, the striker was almost doubly as effective for the Three Lions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rashford attempted 51 passes for England against Costa Rica, while his average for United was around 29 – all at the same 78 per cent completion rate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Crucially for an attacker, though, 32 of those passes at Elland Road ended in the final third. That's the area in which Rashford can have his biggest influence on the game. For United, there were less than 15.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there's attempted dribbles, the confidence to take on his man. Rashford attempted 10 of them against Costa Rica, as he frequently left his defenders chasing his heels. For United, he averaged just 5.4.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">How is that possible?</h2><img id="i-41369f6c95e3ebb6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/12/4D075E9700000578-5821077-image-a-20_1528458897069.jpg" height="433" width="634" alt="In a withdrawn role behind Jamie Vardy, the United striker had freedom to express himself" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a word: freedom. Southgate gave Rashford much greater licence to roam and express himself.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rashford started up front with Jamie Vardy against Costa Rica but in the withdrawn role that gave the United striker the freedom to come short, drift wide and do basically what he wanted while the Leicester man pressed high to push the defence back and leave more space for Rashford to thrive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He does not get that under Mourinho, who is far more restrictive in his demands. Take Rashford's goal for a start. That came from right side. For United, Rashford is hardly ever there. Mourinho plays him mainly as a left-winger in a 4-2-3-1 and expects him to stay there.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Opta, only 19 per cent of Rashford's touches for United last season were on the right-hand side of the opposition half. Against Costa Rica, 32.5 per cent of them were there.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">How do defensive duties affect Rashford?</h2><img id="i-449461071b8f54da" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/12/45C530AD00000578-5821077-image-a-9_1528458440246.jpg" height="445" width="634" alt="His influence wanes at United when he becomes occupied with tracking opposition players " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">That also has an effect on Rashford's ability to influence games. Again, it comes down to freedom within the respective systems.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Southgate's England play with wing-backs. It is their job to track back and stem the danger from opposition wingers. There's an extra centre-back too, which allows the right or left side of the back three to drift wide to lend a hand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rashford's defensive duties are, to the nearest decimal place, nil.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He has nowhere near that freedom under Mourinho. United's 4-2-3-1 means the wingers have to do the tracking back to help out the full-backs. It was for this very reason that Antonio Conte switched to 3-4-3 in his first season at Chelsea, to free up Eden Hazard from his defensive shackles.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last season, nearly 20 per cent of Rashford's touches for United were in his own half. Against Costa Rica, just 7.5 per cent of them were, with 5 per cent still in the middle third of the pitch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unless you're David Beckham or Maynor Figueroa, having a fifth of your touches behind the halfway line is not going to help you score or create goals.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">How do Southgate and Mourinho differ with Rashford?</h2><img id="i-2df16e9464e9a676" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/12/4D07AA7D00000578-5821077-image-a-7_1528458101160.jpg" height="575" width="306" alt="Southgate appears to be more willing to let young players express themselves than Mourinho" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-f25d7d07aff830dd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/12/4D0BE61F00000578-5821077-image-m-6_1528458090550.jpg" height="575" width="306" alt="Mourinho is not scared of publicly criticising his players - young or old" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'What pleased me most is that Marcus Rashford enjoyed his football tonight. He played with a real swagger,' said Southgate after the game on Thursday night.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The slight implication, perhaps, is that Rashford has not been enjoying it at United. As we have seen, Mourinho is not averse to throwing his players under the public bus when they do not meet his demands.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Southgate, though, appears to want to instil confidence in his young players, and give them the freedom to express themselves as they head into the World Cup to represent a country that has for so long been weighed down by pressure and expectation.

Last night was just a warm-up game, with little other than experimentation and preparation on the line. And while Costa Rica are no mugs – they are ranked 23rd in the Fifa rankings, ahead of Sweden and Austria – they are still a side England should beat. And they did so comfortably.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mourinho does not have that luxury. He cannot afford to experiment in the Premier League, especially when the noisy neigbours are charging off into the distance with the title and the plaudits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mourinho relies on his systems and his structures.

That was Jose Mourinho's sly dig at Marcus Rashford after Manchester United's defeat at Brighton in the Premier League last month. Rashford had started the game. Romelu Lukaku had not. This was the same Rashford who lit up Elland Road on Thursday night with a stunning goal and all-round dazzling display in England's victory over Costa Rica.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Nathan Salt</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-08T17:18:19.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Regeneration of Marcus Rashford: Striker different beast for England</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-08T17:18:19.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>World Cup 2018,Premier League,England Football,Jose Mourinho,Marcus Rashford,Manchester United</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5818157/England-2-0-Costa-Rica-Rashford-scores-sensational-long-range-effort-final-warm-friendly.html" title="England 2-0 Costa Rica: Marcus Rashford scores sensational long-range effort as Danny Welbeck heads home to secure Three Lions victory in final warm-up game before Russia World Cup"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5818841/KEOWN-Marcus-Rashord-unrecognisable-player-FA-Cup-final.html" title="Marcus Rashford unrecognisable from player in FA Cup final as youngster shows more enjoyment playing for Gareth Southgate than Jose Mourinho"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5819055/England-boss-Gareth-Southgate-impressed-Marcus-Rashfords-swagger.html" title="England boss Gareth Southgate impressed by Marcus Rashford's 'swagger' as he praises striker's response to 'difficult end to the season' with Manchester United"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5820647/What-f-goal-Marcus-Rashford-screamer-draws-x-rated-praise-Steve-Holland.html" title="'What a f****** goal that was!': Marcus Rashford screamer against Costa Rica draws x-rated praise from England assistant manager Steve Holland"></link></item><item><title>Romelu Lukaku thanks Michael Carrick for one-on-one training sessions which made him a 'better player': 'I've had a lot of mentors in my young career and you're certainly one of them'</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5820967/Romelu-Lukaku-thanks-Michael-Carrick-making-better-player.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2018 11:21:31 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5820967</guid><description><![CDATA[Romelu Lukaku has thanked Manchester United coach Michael Carrick for a series of one-to-one training sessions that the Belgian striker says have made him a 'better player.']]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">Why is Klopp so keen?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Twenty-one goals for Lyon last season is a fair indication, particularly given Fekir’s primary role is to create. It was comfortably the 24-year-old’s best campaign of his career and came after being handed the captain’s armband last summer as other high-profile stars departed the Groupama Stadium.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fekir loves to dribble, capable of breaking down stubborn defences in one fell swoop and has an eye for unpicking locks with one pass. There is plenty of excitement about how he is developing in France.</p><img id="i-8215f3a4cb11203f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/11/06148FE2000003E8-5820885-Fekir_s_agent_Jean_Pierre_Bernes_has_dismissed_claims_of_an_immi-a-57_1528454725857.jpg" height="459" width="634" alt="Fekir goes to the World Cup on the back of his best season for Lyon, in which he netted 21 goals" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">Where would he fit in at Anfield?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A tricky question really. Fekir is most at home as a second striker, which makes Liverpool’s interest intriguing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He can play across the forward line but hasn’t found himself much deeper which, given Philippe Coutinho is still to be replaced directly, is where you’d imagine a marquee signing to be stationed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps Klopp is mulling over a change in shape, or manufacturing a clearly defined plan B, as they look to bring him to Merseyside. You might imagine Fekir taking up a few different roles within Klopp’s attacking system should the move eventually go through.</p><img id="i-702e03285e74930a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/11/4D0BCEC400000578-5820885-image-a-60_1528455182623.jpg" height="396" width="634" alt="Fekir is most at home playing behind to main striker and could replace Philippe Coutinho" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">He’s known for his flair, isn’t he?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Definitely. Fekir scored an absolute stunner at the beginning of last season, just 10 minutes into a home game against Bordeaux, which will live long in the memory.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He picked the ball up midway inside Lyon’s own half, driving away from a marker, before looking up to see the goalkeeper around 10 yards off his line. As Fekir hit halfway he somehow managed to skim an effort into the Bordeaux net, a shot that continued rising up until crossing the line. And it was on his weaker right foot.</p><img id="i-df2e0c2ac0e11b1f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/11/4D0BCECD00000578-5820885-image-a-59_1528455180081.jpg" height="439" width="634" alt="Fekir shows his shirt to the fans in the stadium after scoring during a tie against Saint-Etienne" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">Have there been any other suitors?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, quite a few across Europe. Fekir is a Barcelona supporter and openly spoken about eventually playing at the Nou Camp, but it is Real Madrid who have kept a closer eye on him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Former manager Zinedine Zidane said when discussing France’s options in 2015: ‘Nabil is an incredible player. He impressed me technically.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Real are claimed to have had looked into the possibility of signing Fekir a year later, while a number of the continent’s elite clubs have sent scouts to check on his progress.</p><div class="mol-embed"><div><div style="left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NjqsV5hDKVI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" style="top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"></iframe></div></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">But it hasn’t been an easy journey?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fekir joined Lyon’s academy at 12, and has deep affection for the club. Yet they let him go at 14, Fekir apparently not physically strong enough, and he used that knock back to ‘show them that they had made a mistake’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there was the knee injury three years ago that put off some other interested parties. He missed seven months of the 2015-16 season, an injury sustained on his full international debut. He’s battled back from difficulties and is now ready to take the next step in a burgeoning career.</p><div>

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Amazon are understood to have only paid a cut-price £30million a year for broadcasting simultaneously a full round of midweek fixtures in early December followed by a full festive programme — one of two unwanted packages that went unsold at the Premier League rights auction last February when bids failed to reach the reserve price.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Disappointingly, for the first time the Premier League failed to reveal how much Amazon had paid when all their previous domestic deals had been transparent. It was claimed that there was no regulatory obligation to announce the Amazon numbers officially.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With BT Sport paying £90m for the other package, total domestic revenues are estimated at £4.65bn. That figure is around £450m less than the current £5.1bn domestic rights deal but the shortfall will easily be covered by the increase in overseas revenues.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And having Amazon on board means the Premier League have every opportunity over the next three years of attracting the Seattle-based company to invest a lot more when the TV rights are sold again in another competitive market.</p><img id="i-2b17cfea8c762f7a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/22/4D06D61600000578-5816089-image-a-9_1528405256381.jpg" height="460" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-db1f6ed6ea6286d2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/12/4D02663F00000578-5816089-image-a-35_1528372598474.jpg" height="424" width="634" alt="Richard Scudamore described Amazon as 'an exciting new partner for the Premier League'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Amazon will also stream a weekly highlights show and have begun preliminary talks about additional football programming to support their new content which starts in the 2019-2020 season. The football will be shown on Amazon Prime Video in the UK at no extra cost to Prime members.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jay Marine, vice-president of Prime Video in Europe, said: ‘We are always looking to add more value to Prime and we are delighted to now offer live Premier League matches. Over those two December fixture rounds, Prime members will be able to watch every team.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Scudamore said: ‘Amazon is an exciting new partner for the Premier League and we are very pleased they have chosen to invest in these rights. Prime Video will be an excellent service on which fans can consume live Premier League football including a full round of fixtures for the first time.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was widely predicted that the two packages left on the shelf for four months would go to Sky and BT for next to nothing, with Scudamore being blamed for mis-reading the market and over-estimating the interest of the big digital beasts —Amazon, Facebook and Netflix — having devised the two 20-match packages with online streaming in mind.</p><img id="i-eb06fa6a7d968eb0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/12/4D01F5DA00000578-5816089-image-a-33_1528371949646.jpg" height="448" width="634" alt="BT will have five matches from the split weekend, which will create a chance for a winter break" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-1c80af3ee534949" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/11/4D01946D00000578-5816089-image-a-33_1528366351852.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="This will mean having access to all three services will cost fans just over £70 a month" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Scudamore tweaked Package G to include five weekend matches from the two split weekends to accommodate the winter break. And that helped BT agree to pay £90m and increase their output to 52 matches per season, for which they have paid a total of £975m over three years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sky, who are content with their four prime packages of 128 matches a season costing £3.5bn over three years, made no bid for either package. But BT were also in the market, allowing Scudamore to have competitive bidding when all had seemed lost.

That's £40m more than Huddersfield Town, who were promoted that season. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of Newcastle's high-risk gambit, Deloitte said: 'It remains to be seen whether Newcastle's success emboldens other clubs relegated from the Premier League to follow this strategy.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wolves took the same huge gamble last season — laying out £12.8m to Benfica for winger Helder Costa and £15.8m to Porto for Ruben Neves.

He received 14 yellow cards and one red in 29 games for the Ukrainian side last season.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The other concern is that while Fred has played 39 European matches for Shakhtar, the Ukrainian Premier League isn't exactly at the same standard of the Premier League.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">United fans may have to be patient while the Brazilian gets up to speed next season, especially as he'll probably be entering the campaign off the back of a lengthy run at the World Cup in Russia.</p><img id="i-1c75bfe8541041f8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/11/4CE692FA00000578-5803181-Fred_is_very_quick_and_has_an_excellent_passing_range_while_his_-a-44_1528108919020.jpg" height="561" width="634" alt="Fred is very quick and has an excellent passing range, while his stamina is also impressive" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">How will he fit into a 4-3-3 system at United?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mourinho went with a 4-3-3 formation in a good number of United's matches last season and this would appear to be the best solution when it comes to accommodating both Fred and Paul Pogba in the midfield.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He would play either in the middle or on the right of the midfield three alongside Nemanja Matic, with Pogba stationed on the left.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some of Pogba's best performances for United have come from this left-sided station and potentially Fred could offer the answer when it comes to belatedly getting the best out of the Frenchman at United.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The key is in the link-up and transition between the deep-lying Matic and the rampaging Pogba, plus a forward line of Jesse Lingard, Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku further on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There should be a good balance about United's midfield with Fred aiding Matic in the defensive responsibilities when required and then springing Pogba.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The idea is that the speed of these transitions will give United the thrust going forward they have so often lacked under Mourinho.</p><img id="i-c1831b5df46cebcb" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/4CF9365A00000578-5812225-image-a-146_1528291316623.jpg" height="951" width="634" alt="How United could line up with Fred in a 4-3-3 formation next season" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-5202e229a1518863" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/13/4CEF84B400000578-5812225-image-a-143_1528287139806.jpg" height="453" width="634" alt="Jose Mourinho will hope Fred provides the link between defence and attack in his side" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">How will he fit into a 4-2-3-1 system at United?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">In certain games, Mourinho will revert to the tried and trusted 4-2-3-1, with Fred likely to sit in alongside Matic in defensive midfield.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This would be a more conservative role, with opportunities to break forward more limited, but Fred is certainly capable of the tactical discipline Mourinho would want with this set-up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the chief criticisms of Pogba -

Of the 20 teams that will be in the English top flight next season, 18 of them will have at least one representative in Russia, with Bournemouth and Newcastle the only clubs without a player at the competition. Last season's champions Manchester City, perhaps unsurprisingly, lead the way for the most players at the World Cup out of the Premier League sides, with 16 members of Pep Guardiola's squad involved, including Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Aguero, who will hope to thrive for Belgium and Argentina respectively. </dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Jeorge Bird</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-05T16:57:51.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Man City have the most Premier League players at the World Cup with 16</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-05T16:57:51.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Premier League</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5808417/England-star-Raheem-Sterling-admits-gun-tattoo-criticism-not-hampered-World-Cup-preparations.html" title="England star Raheem Sterling admits gun tattoo criticism has not hampered his World Cup preparations: 'It has not really been that tough'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5807811/France-World-Cup-squad-meet-President-Emmanuel-Macron.html" title="President Emmanuel Macron meets France squad as he becomes latest world leader to wish his side good luck ahead of the World Cup "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5807885/Of-course-idea-Toby-Alderweireld-hints-future-move.html" title="'Of course I have my own idea': Man United target Toby Alderweireld hints that he could go - but admits Tottenham will 'decide future' "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5803253/Mo-Salah-included-Egypts-final-23-man-squad-World-Cup-having-recovered-shoulder-injury.html" title="Mohamed Salah is IN Egypt's final 23-man squad for World Cup having recovered from shoulder injury sustained in Champions League final"></link></item><item><title>Tottenham transfer target Leon Bailey asked to stay at Bayer Leverkusen for another season</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5808481/Tottenham-target-Leon-Bailey-asked-stay-Bayer-Leverkusen-season.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jun 2018 15:25:18 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5808481</guid><description><![CDATA[The talented winger has attracted attention from Premier league clubs this season with the likes of Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, United and Liverpool all adding him to their shortlist.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

The transfer was announced at a time when Pellegrini, his co-worker in the coaching department, was still at the helm of the team,' he added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Guardiola was afraid that Pellegrini would win the championship and other tournaments that season, as he did before he came to Bayern Munich, when Jupp Heynckes won all that is possible.

In two years he won the same as Mancini or Pellegrini. And Pellegrini reached the semi-finals of the Champions League, and Guardiola – not yet.

Toure left City at the end of the season after eight glorious years. But in his final campaign his relationship with Guardiola deteriorated and he made only one Premier League start. In an interview with a French football magazine, the 35-year-old  made the extraordinary suggestion that he was being discriminated against by Guardiola on racial grounds. Seluk warned the City boss of an 'African curse', claimed he will never win the Champions League again and insisted Toure would be happy to play for another club in the Premier League's 'Big Six' for a wage of £1 per week.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Max Winters</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-05T13:08:28.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Yaya Toure’s agent warns Man City's Pep Guardiola of ‘African curse’</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-05T13:08:28.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Manchester City,Pep Guardiola,Premier League</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5805503/Man-City-named-pitch-Yaya-Toure-love-him.html" title="Manchester City named a training pitch after him... but can they still love Yaya Toure now?"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5805623/Pep-Guardiola-Yaya-Toure-clashed-Barcelona-Manchester-City.html" title="Trophies and tension...

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Buried in the latest stream of invective from Yaya Toure is a plain and inconvenient truth about his last season at Manchester City. He ran out of power. When all was said and done, his legs had gone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His performance at the heart of the team's midfield in the League Cup semi-final first leg against Bristol City, six months ago, got to the heart of it. Toure laboured desperately, lasted 70 minutes and was replaced by <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/sergio-aguero/index.html" id="mol-a7fd16d0-683f-11e8-9f89-1da6508f5d29">Sergio Aguero</a>, who scored a 90th-minute winner to rescue the team from embarrassment.

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The suggestions that Guardiola's team selections represent an illicit form of anti-African sentiment lack any kind of credibility - and not only because the manager in question is about to pay out £75million to Leicester City for Riyad Mahrez, an Algeria international.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is Toure's suggestion that Guardiola 'stole' his 'farewell' from City which really drives a stake through his personal credibility. This is a player who, less than a month ago, was being feted to the heavens. A training pitch at City's academy has been named after him, decorated by a mosaic of his winning goal in the 2011 FA Cup Final against Stoke City. Only the hugely loved Pablo Zabaleta has been afforded anything like the same treatment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We are witnessing an ego talking: a individual who cannot contemplate someone else commanding centre stage. Toure does not care for Guardiola's controlling man-management style. Yet when it comes to Guardiola's coaching – the aspect that really matters – he can't admit it is anything less than impressive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He might display more credibility and command more respect at moments like this if he had only engaged a less intellectually challenged agent than Dmitri Seluk.</p><img id="i-5454f279fe6d5dd8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/22/4CDF9AE900000578-0-image-a-21_1528148063616.jpg" height="431" width="634" alt="City are poised to pay £75million for another African player, Algeria playmaker Riyad Mahrez" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Seluk has been a malign influence on Toure ever since he took a punt on the young player in 2003. Toure was drifting, having just experienced a cool reception on trial at Arsenal and ultimately failed to secure a British work permit. He has somehow always felt a debt of obligation to Seluk for giving him a break.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But thought the agent has fuelled a sense of victimhood in his client, it is not the whole story. Toure is 35 now – old enough to see that his complaints are ridiculous. No birthday cake, not enough photographs of himself on display, not enough money despite more than £200,000 a week. Has any player cried wolf quite so much?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The irony of it all is that City had actually wanted to maintain lasting attachment to this individual because he, as much as any player, has taken them up to the top table during the club's often challenging Abu Dhabi decade, scoring at the critical moments. Club chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak said just two weeks ago that Toure would 'always have a place' at the club. That promise looks extremely hard to keep now.</p><img id="i-7e173c91da7f68a7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/22/4CE9716700000578-0-image-a-20_1528148060415.jpg" height="494" width="634" alt="The Ivory Coast international is pictured during City's Carabao Cup clash against Bristol City " class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>


</div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>IAN HERBERT: Buried in the latest stream of invective from Yaya Toure is a plain and inconvenient truth about his last season at Manchester City. He ran out of power. When all was said and done, his legs had gone. His performance at the heart of the team's midfield in the League Cup semi-final first leg against Bristol City, six months ago, got to the heart of it. Toure laboured desperately, lasted 70 minutes and was replaced by Sergio Aguero, who scored a 90th-minute winner to rescue the team from embarrassment. Bristol City finished the season 11th in the Championship. Toure barely featured again. This is an outcome which befalls every player in the final outcome and while most accept it with good grace, grateful for what they have had, Toure's extraordinary outburst against the manager who presided over his last years is an act of narcissism. To embellish his attack on Pep Guardiola with a casually vicious claim of racism discredits those many individuals who are genuinely working to remove the scourge of discrimination from football.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Robert Summerscales</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-05T09:05:54.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>City named a training pitch after Toure but can they still love him?</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-05T09:05:54.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Manchester City,Pep Guardiola,Premier League</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sportsnews/article-5804411/Yaya-Toure-sensationally-accuses-Pep-Guardiola-favouring-white-players.html" title="Yaya Toure sensationally accuses Pep Guardiola of favouring white players, claiming: 'I want to destroy the Pep myth - us Africans aren't treated in the same way as the others'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5774871/Marseile-interested-signing-Yaya-Toure-Marouane-Fellaini-free-transfers.html" title="Marseille interested in signing Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure on free transfer and also consider move to sign Manchester United's Marouane Fellaini"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5761825/Man-City-legend-Toure-refuses-dismiss-huge-rivals-United-dont-rule-big-teams-out.html" title="Manchester City legend Yaya Toure admits he 'loves Paul Pogba' as he refuses to dismiss huge move to rivals United: 'I don't rule big teams out'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5803161/Joey-Barton-backs-Steven-Gerrard-Frank-Lampard-good-managers.html" title="'Pep Guardiola is the best coach and he played with no pace and no skills': Joey Barton backs himself, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard to be good managers because they were 'plodding midfielders'... but admits he will have to tone down Twitter use"></link></item><item><title>Premier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore has a plan to end TV money scrap after pressure from Liverpool owner John Henry</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5805385/Richard-Scudamores-plan-end-Premier-League-TV-money-row-week.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2018 21:31:52 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5805385</guid><description><![CDATA[CHARLES SALE -

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Who is Fred?</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Born in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, on March 5, 1993; Fred spent time in the youth setups of Atletico Mineiro and Porto Alegre prior to making the switch to Internacional in 2010.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was at Internacional where he made his first steps in senior football, with some encouraging performances eventually earning him a transfer to Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the ensuing period, Fred has enjoyed much success, winning three league titles and three Ukranian cups, while he has also become increasingly involved with the Brazil national team, for whom he now has eight caps.</p><img id="i-aadd38a0aca72976"

does he play?</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Earlier in his career Fred received some playing time as an attacking midfielder but he is now fully settled in a slightly deeper position.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although he can play in a more defensive role at times, Fred is at his best as a central midfielder and relishes helping his side to build up play with neat passes, while he can also make good use of his pace to burst past opponents.</p><img id="i-df6e2bc8730cc234" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/11/055ABF55000007D0-0-image-a-16_1528107046892.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="City were the clear front-runners to sign the 25-year-old midfielder

The 28-year-old has continued his Asian adventure alongside wife Samantha by posing for a snap at the famous Golden Triangle.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Max Winters</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-03T18:46:51.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Man United's Chris Smalling visits Golden Triangle with wife Samantha</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-03T18:46:51.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Manchester United,Premier League</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5798139/Jorge-Sampaoli-knows-Argentina-not-win-World-Cup-without-Lionel-Messi-best.html" title="Jorge Sampaoli knows Argentina will not win World Cup without Lionel Messi at his best...

Of course there is Germany and we also have France and Belgium but I would say overall Spain are far ahead.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One Brazilian in particular will be conspicuous by his presence on the field on Sunday.

I don't understand why the British press are pursuing him in this way. He's a lovely guy and I'm so glad to share the dressing room with him.'</p><img id="i-45f152f1440ea1ed" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/21/4CDAC72600000578-0-image-a-2_1527970640666.jpg" height="465" width="634" alt="Danilo (right) and City team-mate Fernandinho are both going to the World Cup with Brazil" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Who is Laurent Blanc?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Blanc was a formidable defender in a playing career that saw him turn out for Montpellier, Napoli, Saint-Etienne, Barcelona, Inter Milan and Manchester United among others.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He has experience of English football after spending two seasons under Sir Alex Ferguson between 2001 and 2003. His stint at Old Trafford was very much in the twilight years though and, after helping United win the 2002/03 Premier League title, he called time on his playing career once his contract expired.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Blanc was also part of the French squad that won the 1998 World Cup on home soil. Nicknamed 'Le President' at Marseille because of his leadership strengths, Blanc was ruled out of the final against Brazil after being sent off in the last four against Croatia for slapping Slaven Bilic.</p><img id="i-d9db0542b9a6aa8d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/01/12/4CCF59A400000578-5794753-image-a-2_1527851509096.jpg" height="424" width="634" alt="After helping Manchester United win the 2002/03 Premier League title, he ended his career" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-small"></span><strong>What has he done as a manager?</strong><span class="mol-style-small"></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In his first job at Bordeaux Blanc not only won the league and cup double in his second season at the club, but also took them to the quarter-finals of the Champions League. It was Bordeaux's first league title in 10 years, and they haven't finished in the top four since his departure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then the French national team job came calling in 2010 following the scandal involving Raymond Domenech at the World Cup in South Africa. Blanc led his country to the quarter-finals of Euro 2012 where they were eventually beaten by Spain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was hired by PSG after Carlo Ancelotti departed for Real Madrid in 2013. Blanc left after three seasons in charge in June 2016 after <span style="font-size: 16px;">the club managed to win Ligue 1 and the French Cup but failed to reach the Champions League semi-finals in his final year in charge.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Bl</span>anc won 11 trophies during his time in charge of PSG, and on two occasions won the domestic quadruple of Ligue 1, the French Cup, the League Cup and the French Super Cup.</p><img id="i-56806499c6061135" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/01/12/4CCF5C8800000578-5794753-image-a-3_1527851514326.jpg" height="450" width="634" alt="In his first job at Bordeaux, Blanc won the league and cup double in his second season" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Why is he out of work?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is not one specific reason for Blanc being out of work for two years but his lack of Champions League success may concern the continent's top teams when they are inspecting the market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At PSG he never made it past the quarter-final stage and, as we have seen with Unai Emery, domestic success will only please the Qatari owners for so long. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Blanc has also admitted to being particularly picky when asked about potential jobs. He has said: 'I know I'm fussy, only a big club would interest me. If not, I'll face facts and think of something else.'</p><img id="i-190c450993486e67" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/01/12/4CCF608900000578-5794753-image-a-4_1527851519091.jpg" height="417" width="634" alt="Blanc has also admitted to being 'fussy' when asked about potential jobs since leaving PSG" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What can Chelsea expect? </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Blanc prefers to concentrate on his own team's set-up rather than tailoring his tactics to counter the opposition's strengths.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is a serious onus put on possession with Blanc's teams wanting to dominate the ball. His time at Barcelona as a player, although brief, has clearly had some significance on his coaching style. The defender spent just one campaign at the Nou Camp and signed on the day that Johan Cruyff was sacked.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Both PSG and Bordeaux boasted the highest possession in France with Blanc in charge while he also put his faith in a number of youngsters in Paris with Adrien Rabiot, Kingsley Coman and Presnel Kimpembe all integrated.</p><img id="i-2cb5b3ea6663d17c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/01/13/4CCF741B00000578-5794753-image-a-40_1527854549944.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Both PSG and Bordeaux boasted the highest possession in France with Blanc in charge" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Is he any good in the transfer market?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It may be too difficult to judge given the riches he was afforded when in charge of PSG.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Edinson Cavani and Marquinhos, both crucial players at Parc des Princes now, were purchased in his first summer in charge while David Luiz and Angel Di Maria followed in the windows after.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chelsea's absence in next season's Champions League may make it harder to lure players to Stamford Bridge this summer with a shake-up in terms of personnel needed after a disappointing campaign. </p><img id="i-618284d282ab7e5d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/01/12/4CCF641A00000578-5794753-image-a-5_1527851524021.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Edinson Cavani (pictured) and Marquinhos were purchased in Blanc's first summer in charge" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What happened to Maurizio Sarri?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chelsea are expected to move into gear when director Marina Granovskaia returns from a break next week but Sarri no longer appears to be first choice to succeed Conte amid concerns about his past.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The situation with Sarri was already complicated by a £7million release clause at Napoli but Chelsea are now more alarmed by an exchange the Italian had with new Italy manager Roberto Mancini.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mancini accused Sarri of hurling homophobic insults at him during a touchline row when he was Inter Milan boss.

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">If there is a chance White Hart Lane might be unfinished in mid-September, Tottenham’s options are limited and mostly disadvantageous.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If they go to Wembley, they potentially make it their home for another year, unless Tottenham can persuade the Premier League board to grant special dispensation allowing them to switch mid-way. Daniel Levy is lucky his fate is not in the hands of fellow chairmen, given how few friends he will have made in boardrooms with his hard-nosed transfer dealing. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is also the matter of six elite clubs chasing four Champions League places. Why would Arsenal, Chelsea or Liverpool, for instance, wish to help Tottenham? ‘The only place to watch the Champions League in London’, smirked an advertisement for Tottenham’s new ground.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So while the Premier League as a body might be sympathetic to an extra game or two at Wembley — after all, the new White Hart Lane is a fabulous facility, and investment of that nature should be nurtured and encouraged — Levy must hope the owners of his rivals in the capital don’t spend much time reading the hoardings from limousine windows. And, if they do, they don’t bear grudges and start applying pressure upstairs.</p><img id="i-f8b5a0a4c4364604" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/21/4CCAD5B900000578-5792761-image-a-85_1527797727707.jpg" height="408" width="634" alt="If the stadium is unfinished in mid-September, Tottenham's options are disadvantageous" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The alternative would be to ask for a longer run of away matches, but how many can be granted before it affects the dynamic of the league? Blackpool were given permission to start with two away games in 2010-11, but were at home to Fulham on August 28. Liverpool played three games away at the start of 2016-17, while work on the new stand at Anfield was completed, but hosted Leicester on September 10. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">West Ham began last season with a trio of away fixtures while the London Stadium was converted after the athletics World Championships. Again, though, they were in after the international break for a September 11 game against Huddersfield.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So three is the maximum until now and there is no guarantee Tottenham would be well-received if asking for more. Half the league has to play two of their first three matches away, so an extra trip is not seen as greatly disruptive. But stretch that to four, or five or more and it could play havoc with the schedule. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Premier League product exists on very precise lines. Even if they were successful, what effect might there be on Tottenham’s season? In April, Mauricio Pochettino admitted finally what others had suggested for several seasons: that Tottenham’s slow start to the campaign had cost them.</p><img id="i-751ae230258ee222" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/21/4CCABF7200000578-5792761-image-a-81_1527797417416.jpg" height="416" width="634" alt="Mauricio Pochettino admitted that Tottenham's slow start to the last campaign had cost them" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said next year must be different. But how difficult will it be if Tottenham have to play three away games, maybe more?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">West Ham struggled to recover from three straight defeats by Manchester United, Southampton and Newcastle, while Liverpool’s away fixtures were against Arsenal, Burnley and Tottenham, and delivered four points from nine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pochettino’s point was that by the time Tottenham stabilised this season, Manchester City were as good as over the horizon, and there is no reason they won’t start that way again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With three matches now looking the minimum absence, and the Premier League’s fixtures announced on June 14, time is not on Tottenham’s side.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Neither is next season’s schedule, unless Pochettino can reverse the habits of old.</p><div>
