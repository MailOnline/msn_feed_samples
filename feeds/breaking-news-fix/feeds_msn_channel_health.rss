For eighth graders, the jumps were even more dramatic: they did 37 and 39 percent better, respectively, on their reading and math tests.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The study authors describe multilingual students as a 'subgroup' of English learners, whose proficiency gets masked when they are lumped together with students who are still working to learn English.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'By definition, ELs are not yet proficient in listening, speaking, reading, or writing English, and their language skills impact their performance on content-area assessments administered in English,' but the same does not hold true for those who have a firm grasp on multiple languages, including English. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Karen Thompson, study co-author, says she and her fellow educational and linguistic researchers call this issue a 'revolving door,' or a 'gap that never closes' between those who are current English learners and those who were once in that category but have since become proficient in English.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So the gains made by students that transition from one category to the other do not get counted, and their academic achievements go unrecognized.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, scientific studies of the brain suggest children and adults with good command of multiple languages have many cognitive advantages that lend themselves to better academic performance, too. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many years ago, scientists theorized - rather simplistically - that two conflicting vocabularies would cause children's development to be delayed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The opposite turns out to be true. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Multilingual people may have a 'cognitive advantage...research suggests being able to direct your attention and ignore information or understand the arbitrariness of a sign can confer an advantage in learning to read,' sad Thompson. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">People who are multilingual have more gray matter in the region of the brain called the inferior parietal cortex. This is thought to foster greater plasticity, or mental flexibility. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cognitive plasticity is known to be key to learning, memory and the brain's executive functioning. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, it is no coincidence, then, that students with extra language skills - and, therefore, extra brain matter - excel in educational settings. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Similarly, scientists have found links between multilingualism and delayed onset of dementia and Alzheimer's disease, leading advocate Fabrice Jaumont, education attaché at the French Embassy in New York, to tell <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://frenchly.us/multilingual-public-health-issue-bilingualism-spotlight/">Frenchly</a>: 'In the end, being multilingual is a public health issue. We have to invest massively in this kind of education.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The US has finally begun to invest a bit in multilingualism, and 'dual language programs increased dramatically' between 2003 and 2015, when the study's data was collected, Thompson said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What's more, research on dual-language programs is still in its earliest days, but suggests the approach shows great promise - for both English learners and native English speakers, providing real-world evidence of the brain plasticity neuroscientists have observed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thompson notes that 'it is important to remember that the scores of multilingual students are still below those of monolingual students, but  most are students of color, they are economically disadvantaged, they face strong disadvantages and less resources.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The fact that despite all that, there is growth, that suggests that there may be some advantages to policies and that multilingual students can achieve at high levels.' </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>An NYU study found that multilingual students' academic scores improved at double or triple the rate of native English speakers, bolstering evidence that more languages are better for grains.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Michelle Curran</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-12T05:06:55.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Bilingual kids advance at DOUBLE the rate of native English speakers</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-12T05:06:55.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5363123/Learning-language-protect-ALZHEIMERS.html" title="The power of learning a second language: Alzheimer's patients who are bilingual endure a slower rate of memory loss, first study of its kind reveals"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4172670/Are-bilingual-protected-Alzheimer-s.html" title="Are YOU bilingual?

Dialysis is also associated with fatigue and depression, can remove too many nutrients from the blood and only works while patients are connected to the machine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The idea with the artificial kidney is that it continuously filters blood inside the body and avoids these problems — researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, have developed it over the past 20 years.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The implant is essentially two components — filters to separate the various substances in the blood, and a ‘bioreactor’ which transfers these either to the blood, or to the bladder for removal from the body. These are encased in a hard-wearing box coated in a film made from materials safe for use inside the body. It is connected with tubes to nearby veins and to the bladder.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The artificial kidney first passes blood through layered silicon filters to remove waste and then through the ‘bioreactor’ made of lab-grown live kidney cells which reabsorb vital salts, sugars and water into the blood, in a similar way to a real kidney.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cleaned blood is returned to the circulation through a vein the implant is connected to, while waste material drains into the bladder via a tube.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Researchers believe they will start testing parts of the device on humans within months, after trials in pigs showed success in overcoming a problem with blood clots.

It's not 'just in case'; this is being rolled out to millions of people, so they need to be right. You can't have a risk that 30 percent could get diarrhea or 10 percent could get a rash. The side effects need to be lower than any other drug.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We have a much higher standard for safety and non-reactivity than we do for other drugs.

What had started with night sweats and feeling out-of-sorts had progressed to insomnia, exhaustion and anxiety, and the 51-year-old wasn’t coping.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I would wake at 3 or 4am every night and not be able to get back to sleep, then be exhausted during the day, and I became very anxious,’ says Jayne, who runs her own marketing business and lives in Bristol with husband Tim, 53, a sports commentator, and their 16-year-old daughter Grace.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I’ve always been very good at juggling and multi-tasking, and used to sleep well, so it floored me. I couldn’t function and I just didn’t feel like myself. I’d come home from work and be asleep on the sofa from 7pm to 9pm, missing time with my daughter and husband, then go to bed,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I started making excuses not to go out with friends because I knew it would make me even more exhausted. On the odd occasion we did go to a friend’s house for supper, we were always first to leave.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The final straw was when I was in a restaurant one evening and I pretty much fell asleep at the table. I knew I had to get help.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Around 80 per cent of women going through the menopause or during the lead-up to it (known as perimenopause) experience symptoms including hot flushes, sweats, mood swings, stiffness and loss of libido.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Symptoms can start years before the actual menopause — defined as one year after periods stop — and continue for an average of four years afterwards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For around a quarter of these women — approximately 400,000 — symptoms are severe, having an impact on their relationships and their work, according to a survey carried out by the private medical firm Nuffield Health in 2014.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WOMEN WRONGLY TOLD THEY NEED BLOOD TESTS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The beauty entrepreneur Liz Earle recently made headlines by suggesting women should convince their GPs to give them hormone replacement therapy (HRT) as early as possible — from the age of 45, even if they have not started the menopause.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘You might have to big up your symptoms a bit to get it — it depends how friendly your GP is,’ she was reported as saying.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But many women who are going through menopause and suffering terrible symptoms struggle to get HRT from their GPs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since 2015, NICE has recommended HRT — which comes in a pill, patch or gel — as an effective treatment for many women who have hot flushes, night sweats and low mood.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Furthermore, it says women over 45 with these symptoms can be prescribed HRT without having to have a blood test — a Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) test — to check their hormone levels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is because the results of these tests can fluctuate greatly in the lead-up to the menopause, making them ‘unreliable and a waste of money’, says NICE (the test is being phased out in other countries, too).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, when Jayne went to her GP describing her symptoms and asking for HRT, her doctor wrongly insisted that she have the blood test before they would prescribe anything. Then, when the results came back normal, and although the GP acknowledged that she probably was menopausal, she was refused HRT and told to come back in a couple of months.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I was desperately disappointed and upset because I needed help,’ says Jayne.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It also made me feel a bit stupid, as if the symptoms I’d been experiencing weren’t severe enough to warrant the treatment — yet I wasn’t functioning.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While prescriptions for HRT have risen slightly over the past three years, just 10 per cent of the 1.5 million women in the UK with menopausal symptoms were taking the treatment in 2015, according to NICE. And some experts believe as many as a million other women could benefit from HRT — yet aren’t getting it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>THOUSANDS MAY BE MISSING OUT</strong></p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-0fdce9f0-6dbe-11e8-b490-4dc4674a07b6">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">What you should do if your doctor won’t prescribe it?</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Most women do not experience problematic menopausal symptoms. For those who do, the first port of call is usually their GP.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, GPs’ advice to women about HRT is ‘not consistent around the country’, according to Dr Heather Currie, a spokeswoman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and former chair of the British Menopause Society.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you don’t get the help you need, ask the surgery receptionist if you can see a GP in the practice with an interest in women’s health, suggests Dr Helen Stokes-Lampard, head of the Royal College of GPs. This is a GP who has taken extra training in women’s health, and most — but not every — surgery will have one, she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before seeing your GP, read up on the NICE guidance, which, as well as explaining that you don’t need blood tests to be prescribed hrt, recommends asking your GP questions such as:What types of treatment are suitable for my particular symptoms? Are complementary therapies safe to take alongside other treatments? This is to help identify the best form of treatment for you.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘At a conservative estimate, between 70 and 80 per cent of women with menopausal symptoms could potentially take HRT, which usually provides more benefits than risks to these women,’ explains Dr Louise Newson, a private menopause expert in the West Midlands and a director of the Primary Care Women’s Health Forum charity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Yet many thousands are not being offered a treatment that can not only improve symptoms but lower their future risk of heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis,’ she adds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">NHS figures show that while in 2000 there were 6.1 million prescriptions for HRT in England, last year it was 2.5 million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So why are so many menopausal women not getting the drug?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For 15 years, HRT was mired in controversy after two major studies, in 2002 and 2003, suggested it significantly increased women’s risk of breast cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Following the research, the number of those taking HRT more than halved as both women and doctors lost confidence in the drug. Then, in 2015, NICE published a review of existing studies which found that the risks had been overstated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It said taking HRT does not increase the risk of heart disease when started in women under 60, and is not linked to type 2 diabetes, while oestrogen-only HRT brings little or no increase in the risk of breast cancer. HRT with both oestrogen and progestogen is associated with a small increase in the risk of breast cancer, but this reduces within five years after a woman stops taking HRT.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The hope was that this would reassure both women and doctors that HRT is safe for most women.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet according to new research presented last week at the World Congress on Menopause, in Vancouver, many British doctors are still not confident about prescribing HRT. The study of 203 health professionals in the UK (77 per cent of whom were GPs) found a third were not confident about how to manage the menopause and 23 per cent felt unsure about prescribing HRT to otherwise healthy women because of confusion about the risks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A quarter wrongly thought that any type of HRT increases the risk of breast cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, only half (52 per cent) had received any formal training on the menopause and 25 per cent were not aware of the different types and doses of HRT.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="health-ccox"><strong>‘FEW GPs HAVE READ GUIDELINES’</strong></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rather than giving women HRT, more than half had prescribed or offered antidepressants to menopausal women who had low mood or anxiety. Yet the official advice is that such women should be offered HRT to alleviate their symptoms unless they have a diagnosis of clinical depression.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘In this case, the low mood is the result of a hormonal issue and there is little evidence that antidepressants will help,’ says Dr Heather Currie, a spokeswoman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and former chair of the British Menopause Society.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Newson, who led the survey which was published in the British Journal of Family Medicine last year, says she wasn’t surprised by the findings: ‘There is very poor training in medical school and little ongoing education of doctors about the menopause.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘When I was at medical school in the late Eighties and early Nineties, I didn’t receive any undergraduate or postgraduate training about the menopause — I only know about it after taking the initiative myself to go on courses so I could improve women’s health, which is so often neglected. Very few GPs have read the NICE guidance on the diagnosis and management of the menopause.</p><img id="i-39cd2fa773a09cbd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/22/4D240D7F00000578-0-image-m-18_1528752273047.jpg" height="451" width="634" alt="The hope was that this would reassure both women and doctors that HRT is safe for most women" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I’m not surprised, really — there is so much for them to read and general practice is incredibly busy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘However, the menopause will affect 50 per cent of their patients and doctors aren’t always giving them the help they need.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Newson adds: ‘For many women, the symptoms are a complete misery and we should be doing much more to help them. It’s about helping women weigh up the risks and benefits — in my experience, many are happy to take a small risk to get their lives back.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Diane Danzebrink, a Buckinghamshire-based private psychotherapist who specialises in the menopause, many women asking for HRT and other menopause treatments are fobbed off by their doctors.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Women are desperate for help and there are an awful lot who want HRT but are not getting it because of poor GP education,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I know for a fact there are lots of GPs who have never heard of NICE guidelines on the menopause, and more that have never read them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>ANTIDEPRESSANTS GIVEN INSTEAD </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Unfortunately, a lot of GPs are working with out-of-date information and consequently a lot of women are told “we don’t recommend it” or are prescribed antidepressants for low mood when they should be getting HRT,’ adds Diane.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Many of the women I counsel are very emotional and frustrated because they have tried to address their symptoms and they have been turned away, fobbed off or not listened to.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘In the worst-case scenarios, women have to leave their jobs as they struggle with mental health and physical symptoms.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Recently, she counselled three former NHS nurses who received so little support from their GPs and at work that they all quit their jobs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Seventy-seven per cent of the NHS workforce are women, and their average age is 43. How many of these women can we afford to lose?’ says Diane. ‘I don’t think this is a particular issue with male GPs, but inadequate education on the subject of the menopause. However, if the menopause affected men, we would be in a very different place now.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it’s not just doctors who remain unsure about HRT — women themselves often don’t ask for it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A poll last year for Good Health revealed that more than a third of women — 37 per cent — were ‘very concerned’ about the side-effects of HRT, and only 27 per cent felt the benefits of the treatment outweighed the possible risks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a result, only 17 per cent of those who had been through the menopause said they had used HRT to help with symptoms (a similar number used supplements such as black cohosh, milk thistle and omega-3 instead), according to the survey of 2,002 women aged 30 to 80 by Ipsos Mori.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHAT ABOUT THE HEALTH RISKS?</strong></p><img id="i-a0ec5947ef8144b1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/22/4D23FED300000578-0-What_had_started_with_night_sweats_and_feeling_out_of_sorts_had_-m-20_1528752346017.jpg" height="414" width="634" alt="What had started with night sweats and feeling out-of-sorts had progressed to insomnia, exhaustion and anxiety, and the 51-year-old wasn¿t coping" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even among those currently taking HRT, 40 per cent said they were worried about side-effects.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Klim McPherson, emeritus professor of public health epidemiology at Oxford University, who worked on one of the original studies in 2003 that found a raised breast cancer risk, remains concerned about the health risks of HRT despite the NICE advice and similar international guidelines.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says he is pleasantly surprised that women are still not asking for HRT: ‘Women are clearly more sensible than some people think. The short-term benefits are clear — but women should know more about the risks than they normally do. I’m not against any HRT; it just should be used with caution and respect.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Currie admits HRT is not for everyone — some women don’t want to go on medication or are unhappy with the side-effects.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, latest evidence shows the risks are small and, for most women, outweighed by the benefits if treatment is started before the age of 60 or within ten years of the menopause.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The consensus is that more needs to be done to educate doctors and help women through the menopause based on all the information. To this end, the British Menopause Society has set up a specialist training scheme to teach GPs, gynaecologists and specialist nurses about the menopause, and more than 100 health professionals have already graduated from it since it began two years ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the goal of having a specialist NHS menopause service in every region of the country has not yet been achieved. For example, there is no such service in Cornwall or Devon, according to Dr Currie.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After being sent away by her GP, Jayne decided to seek help for her symptoms privately with Dr Newson. ‘After talking it through with her, in my case I felt the benefits of HRT definitely outweighed the risks,’ says Jayne.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She has been on HRT now for a month, which she says has been ‘a revelation’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘After four days I started sleeping properly and within two weeks I knew I was in a really good place,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jayne advises other women wanting to go on HRT to do their homework before seeing their GP.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Before I went to my GP, I didn’t know about the NICE guidelines. If I’d known, I would have felt more confident to push for the treatment. I’d urge women wanting to go on HRT to read up on it beforehand because GPs don’t always seem to be up-to-date on the latest advice and don’t want to prescribe it.’</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>After two years of trying to manage the debilitating symptoms of the menopause on her own, Jayne Caple went to her GP at the end of her tether.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="health-ccox">Herbal remedies have been around for </span></strong><strong><span class="health-ccox">millennia — now science is catching up. In a </span></strong><strong><span class="health-ccox">new book, a leading professor of neuroscience </span></strong><strong><span class="health-ccox">and a pharmacognosist (who studies medicines </span></strong><strong><span class="health-ccox">derived from plants) explain how plants affect </span></strong><strong><span class="health-ccox">the brain and simple ways you can use them </span></strong><strong><span class="health-ccox">to boost mood, improve sleep and memory. . .</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’re all familiar with the idea that plants provide our bodies with nutrition, but less well known is the fact that many plants also contain chemicals that reach our brain cells and affect different pathways linked to being calm, sleeping well and feeling positive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They do this by increasing or reducing neuron (nerve cell) activity, more specifically mimicking, boosting or blocking transmitter signals between brain cells.</p><img id="i-a86f6771ae6ac02b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/21/4D24A6E400000578-5832385-image-a-43_1528750047037.jpg" height="802" width="634" alt="Herbal remedies have been around for millennia — now science is catching up" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Botanical brain balms — as we call them — work in a different way from conventional medicine because plant extracts are ‘multi-drugs’ which means they contain a range of ingredients, each with different health benefits, unlike single drug medicines. This means they can work on more than one aspect of the brain to beneficial effect. Traditional plant medicines, as long as they are produced, prescribed and used correctly, have a long legacy of safe use simply because they have been taken for hundreds if not thousands of years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most plant medicines have fewer side-effects compared with chemical drugs, and some have none at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Plant medicines are also generally pleasant to take — certainly more agreeable to make part of your daily life than some prescription drugs for minor ailments, and for long-term use as remedies to protect your health.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, we show you how to harness the power of plants — from making soothing teas and a herbal pillow for sleep to a pain-relieving ointment — and reveal the latest science behind why these work.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>CHILLI OIL FOR ACHES AND PAINS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You might think of it as something you eat, but chilli oil is a simple but effective skin ointment for aches and pains.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cayenne pepper — a common, moderately hot type of chilli — is used in herbal medicine for pain and topically for wounds, bruises, burns, sciatica, neuralgia and muscle spasms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In controlled trials, it has been shown to reduce post-shingles pain, diabetic neuropathy (a complication of the condition, causing nerve damage, often in the feet and legs) and back pain.</p><img id="i-2dd38d41e61b5050" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/22/4D24B2CA00000578-5832385-image-a-53_1528751451995.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="You might think of it as something you eat, but chilli oil is a simple but effective skin ointment for aches and pains" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The hot pungency of cayenne is due to chemical compounds called capsaicinoids, such as the active capsaicin. This is the key to its painkilling benefits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In lab tests, cayenne’s capsaicinoids have been found to knock out a receptor in the brain (TRPV1) effectively — normally this receptor releases a chemical called substance P that transmits pain signals to the brain. Capsaicin also depletes substance P itself.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fresh chilli pods, dried pods and ground cayenne pepper (not chilli powder, which is a mix of cayenne and other spices) can be used in chilli oil. Chop three fresh or dried chillis and stir into 50ml (2 fl oz) olive oil. Add 1 tsp of dried cayenne pepper if you like it hot. You can use as a skin ointment or on food. Keeps in the refrigerator for three to four days.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>SPRAY TO BOOST YOUR BRAIN</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">People reaching middle age begin to notice they don’t remember things quite as well as they used to, so this is the time to start using plants to protect the brain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our research has shown that sage (both Salvia officinalis and S.lavandulaefolia) and other well-known household herbs, such as lemon balm, work on certain chemical messengers in the brain to improve memory.</p><img id="i-bf64332dc7cc1054" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/22/4D24C29600000578-5832385-image-a-54_1528751468744.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Our research has shown that sage (both Salvia officinalis and S.lavandulaefolia) and other well-known household herbs, such as lemon balm, work on certain chemical messengers in the brain to improve memory" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">This everyday household cleaning spray uses several plants — sage, pine and mint — that make it a useful household cleaner as well as having brain-boosting properties. For example, in controlled trials — the gold standard for medical evidence, typically involving a placebo for comparison — sage has been found to enhance memory and alertness in healthy people. It also improves attention in the elderly and counters cognitive impairment as well as improving behavioural measures in Alzheimer’s.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-760c7210-6db7-11e8-b95b-ed77c1e6f7bb">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">WILLOW TREE BARK IS AS GOOD AS ASPIRIN</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">The most famous anti-inflammatory plant is white willow (Salix alba) — aspirin is derived from the chemical salicin in its bark and is still the world’s most widely used drug.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The bark itself — which is a traditionally used medicine for joint pain, headaches, gout, lumbago, sciatica, inflammation and fevers — could make a comeback on account of its superior safety as pain relief.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The few controlled trials in humans on willow bark show it reduces lower back pain, joint pain and treats osteoarthritis. One study which compared willow bark (at a dose equivalent to around 240mg salicin) to a prescription-only painkiller (a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) found it was as effective when given for more than six months to people with lower back pain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Willow bark works for pain the same way as aspirin, by regulating prostaglandins (hormones released when cells are damaged). But the whole bark also lowers multiple inflammatory markers and has been shown to be as good as, if not more effective than, aspirin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Willow bark takes longer to act but its effects last longer than aspirin. Also, willow bark does not cause internal bleeding — as can sometimes happen with aspirin — because salicin in willow bark is absorbed in the small intestine rather than the stomach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fresh or dried bark can be made into a decoction — a concentrated liquid for pain. Use 20g dried (or 40g fresh) finely chopped white willow bark in 750ml water simmered to 500ml water. Take 120ml three times daily.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have been prescribed aspirin, you should not switch or stop taking it, or take the two together, without consulting your GP.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a pilot trial we carried out last year at Dilston Physic Garden (where we collaborated with medical herbalists, universities and other research bodies to widen understanding into medicinal plants), sage taken with lemon balm and rosemary improved the ability to recall a list of words by more than 50 per cent in 63-year-olds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Add equal amounts of the pure essential oils of sage, pine and mint to an alcohol base such as vodka (it should be about 40 per cent proof). Use 1–2 parts oil per 100 parts base (or adjust proportion to preferred scent). Shake and leave to disperse. Bottle in a dark container with spray attachment. Spray liberally over working surfaces (test a small area first). The spray can be stored for a year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>BANANA BREAD TO CALM YOU DOWN</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Calming plants often enhance the activity of a chemical messenger in the brain called GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), which is how anti-anxiety drugs such as benzodiazepines also work. GABA prevents brain cells from firing too often and is essentially the brain’s main decelerator.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bergamot — a citrus fruit that’s a hybrid of bitter orange and lemon — is a key remedy in Italian folk medicine, and gives Earl Grey tea its distinct aroma. A small number of studies in humans confirm that bergamot can relax you when it is used with other calming plants (typically these include lavender and ylang ylang).</p><img id="i-edad42f6b5731f88" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/22/4D24C28D00000578-5832385-image-a-55_1528751479607.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Calming bergamot teamed with mood-boosting banana makes a satisfying cake-like bread" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In preliminary studies, it has been found to lower pulse rate and blood pressure when massaged into the skin with lavender, and is also relaxing when inhaled.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Calming bergamot teamed with mood-boosting banana makes a satisfying cake-like bread.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>For the bread</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">250g (9oz) plain flour</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">125g (4½oz) light brown sugar</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pinch of salt</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1 tsp baking powder</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">3 medium-ripe bananas</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1 tbsp grated zest of bergamot orange</p><div>

Tests have shown hops depress the central nervous system, and increase the calming neurotransmitter (GABA). It also boosts levels of hormones such as melatonin and adenosine (both promote sleep).</p><img id="i-2f553fb6988eac30" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/22/4D24C27F00000578-5832385-You_can_take_hop_as_a_tea_or_you_can_sew_the_flowers_into_a_pill-a-4_1528754382752.jpg" height="420" width="633" alt="You can take hop as a tea or you can sew the flowers into a pillow.

The widely recognised anti-depressive St John’s wort used in this face cream leads the way when it comes to plants that lift mood and alleviate mild to moderate depression (severe depression shouldn’t be self-treated). Other plants that have had some success in human studies include turmeric and saffron.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thirty clinical studies show the efficacy of St John’s wort, and in controlled trials for mild to moderate depression it is as effective as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as Prozac, but with fewer side-effects.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although adverse effects are rare, St John’s wort can interfere with other medications, including the Pill. Particular caution should be taken if you are on anti-anxiety or antidepressant medications (especially SSRIs). Always consult your doctor or registered medical herbalist before taking any plant at a medicinal level first.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This lovely cream lifts the mood as the essential oil constituents permeate the skin. Use a commercial base face lotion which contains natural ingredients.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mix in pure St John’s wort essential oil to a proportion not exceeding 1 per cent of the entire mixture (for instance for a 125 ml jar of cream you’d need 1-2 ml — about 40 drops). After thorough mixing, add the cream to dark brown or black jars.

However, there is some research to suggest that plants such as garlic and nettles can be revitalising — though exactly why is less clear.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Japanese studies on 1,000 patients with fatigue, depression and anxiety, found that garlic extract (with vitamins) reduced all these symptoms in the majority of people.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In patients with stress-related symptoms, the same combination relieved symptoms such as general fatigue, headache, dizziness and appetite loss.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In lab tests, garlic extracts seem to affect adrenal gland molecules that govern the stress responses and blood pressure (the adrenal glands are located above the kidneys and produce many of our hormones, including cortisol, sometimes called the ‘stress hormone’).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This soup, made with wild garlic, nettles, as well as ginger, is a lovely tonic. Lab studies suggest nettles can act on acetylcholine receptors — the brain’s memory messenger.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Nettle &amp; wild garlic soup</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Serves 3-4</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Knob of butter or 1 tbsp olive oil</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1 onion, finely chopped</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1 carrot, finely chopped</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1 celery stick, finely chopped</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2-3 small potatoes, sliced</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1 tsp fresh ginger, chopped</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1-2 tsp dry or fresh turmeric, chopped</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1l vegetable stock</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">400g (14oz) nettle tips and Garlic leaves, chopped.</p><img id="i-74633f9b83b62732" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/22/4D24C25B00000578-5832385-image-a-58_1528751524733.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="A soup, made with wild garlic, nettles, as well as ginger, is a lovely tonic.

This makes sense scientifically — first because each plant contains more than one active ingredient that can target different systems, and second because the health of one part of the body is affected by other parts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The brain is the most highly connected living system. So depression can impair cognitive function, and stress can interfere with memory or increase the feeling of pain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These truffles are made with several ingredients that help with four or more of the calm, memory, mood, sleep, pain or energy functions. Lavender has been found to improve sleep in cancer patients, and improve sleep quality and energy in students.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Terry O'Neil has photographed everyone from The Beatles to the Rolling Stones, Brigitte Bardot to Frank Sinatra.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He is also the only person to have photographed every James Bond star from Sean Connery to Daniel Craig.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He is known for his razor-sharp eye — so imagine his horror when he woke up one morning to find he couldn’t see clearly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I wasn’t blind but everything looked a little blurry,’ says Terry, now 79. ‘When I went to bed it had all been fine, but suddenly it was like looking through the middle of an old scratched lens.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I got up but I initially felt a little unsteady on my feet because my view of the world had changed slightly.’</p><img id="i-a483161a850b2f11" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/21/4D2400C400000578-5832423-image-a-3_1528750553688.jpg" height="445" width="634" alt="Terry O'Neil has photographed everyone from The Beatles to the Rolling Stones, Brigitte Bardot to Frank Sinatra" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Terry, who is married to Laraine (his second wife was Faye Dunaway) and has four children and three grandchildren, wondered if it was a complication of cataract surgery he’d had six months earlier.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It was strange because I thought I’d have near enough perfect vision after getting my cataracts done and was still busy working as a photographer,’ he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After waking up that morning with hazy vision, he went back to the surgeon who had carried out his cataract operation on the NHS.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The surgeon explained that this new problem wasn’t related to his cataracts but was most likely one that potentially had even bigger ramifications for his sight: age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a condition that leads to a loss of central vision which can make everyday activities such as driving or even reading difficult. Around 600,000 people in the UK have some degree of sight loss as a result of it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was devastating news. ‘I was shocked to the core,’ Terry recalls. ‘As a photographer, losing my sight was my worst nightmare. My eyes have been my livelihood for over 50 years and I was terrified I would end up blind and never be able to photograph anyone again.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His surgeon referred Terry to Evelyn Mensah, a consultant eye surgeon at Central Middlesex NHS Hospital in London, who specialises in macular degeneration. She confirmed the diagnosis.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘By the time I saw her a couple of weeks later my eyesight had deteriorated further, so by then I was struggling to read a book or paper and couldn’t see the hands on my watch very well. It was made pretty clear to me that unless I was treated fast, I’d be left partially blind and unable to work as a photographer. I couldn’t stand the thought that I might never see my wife, my children or grandchildren ever again.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">AMD typically strikes people in their 50s or 60s and affects one 90-year-old in five. It reduces the ability to make out fine detail —straight lines appear wavy, printed words blurred.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘When someone with the condition looks at another person’s face or a clock, they’ll only be able to see the outline of the head or clock but not the facial features or the hands of the clock,’ explains Ms Mensah.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are two kinds of AMD; dry and wet. Dry, a slow progressive disease, accounts for 80 per cent of cases and is caused by a build-up of waste products under a thinning macula (the central part of the retina at the back of the eye).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wet AMD is caused by the growth of fragile blood vessels under the macula. These are prone to leak and bleed, which can blur the vision and, if not treated, lead to scarring and sight loss.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘This occurs rapidly, which is why treatment should be started within a couple of weeks,’ says Ms Mensah. ‘While there is no treatment for dry AMD, any progression is extremely slow — over years and years.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is some evidence that a healthy diet rich in substances called carotenoids (lutein and zeaxanthin), found in brightly coloured vegetables and green leafy veg such as spinach, can help delay progression.</p><img id="i-a2da11774ea45d6c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/21/4D2400E000000578-5832423-image-a-7_1528750586702.jpg" height="443" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Terry, however, has wet AMD, ‘which is the cause of more devastating visual loss if it’s not treated’, says Ms Mensah.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As well as age, risk factors for AMD include a family history of the condition. But the most common risk factor people can control is smoking, ‘which quadruples your chances of getting macular degeneration’, she adds.Terry admits being ‘a 20-a-day man for nearly 50 years — I started smoking at 12 and didn’t stop until I was 60’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Had he developed the condition 20 years ago, the chances are he would now be completely blind. Indeed, AMD remains the leading cause of blindness in this country. However, for wet AMD there are now injections to prevent further blood vessels developing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The injections block the action of vascular endothelial growth factor, which is responsible for the growth of the abnormal vessels under the macula.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This stabilises an individual’s vision in more than 90 per cent of cases; in 30 per cent of cases it can even lead to improved vision.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thanks to the treatment, Terry is still able to take pictures but his life now revolves around monthly hospital appointments to have injections in his eyes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It’s not a lot of fun,’ he says. ‘But the alternative — going blind — is much worse.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Whenever I tell my mates what the treatment involves, they screw up their faces and ask: “How can you bear to have that done?”. But you learn to live with it, and the thought of what’s going to happen is worse than the actual injection.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During the first three months of treatment, patients need to have their eyes injected monthly. Thereafter the injections are usually reduced to once every two months. In the second year of treatment, the regularity of injections can be further reduced.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Within a few weeks of the first treatment most people will have noticed an improvement,’ says Ms Mensah. But for this to last, some people, like Terry, need regular repeat treatments for ever.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We don’t discharge patients who are stable and no longer need treatment, as they can develop re-activation of the wet AMD,’ adds Ms Mensah.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Terry’s AMD is more active in his left eye, so one eye needs treatment every two months and the other eye every four months.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For Terry ‘the important thing is that my eyesight has stabilised and it’s not getting any worse’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But some days are worse than others. ‘I make sure I sit by a bright light to read and I’ve got a watch with bigger hands that stick out, but on a bad day I rely on a magnifying glass for things such as reading or doing a crossword.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for photography: ‘I still do the odd charity job, my AMD hasn’t impacted on that, although I’ve pretty much photographed everyone I want to photograph.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The success of the treatment means he won’t have problems recognising all those helping him celebrate his 80th birthday next month. ‘I’m just so grateful,’ says Terry. ‘I feel blessed to still be able to see. Most people don’t think twice about all they see around them, but I do. I’m a lucky man.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">macularsociety.org</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><img id="i-fb398deeb8050975" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/21/4D24AF5000000578-0-image-a-1_1528750418377.jpg" height="274" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-0ca1fc80-6db9-11e8-b490-4dc4674a07b6">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Revolting Remedies </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">This week: Urine therapy</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Could your own urine be an effective treatment for sweaty feet?

The cancer was back — and it had spread to her brain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there was a kernel of hope: the shocking news came just as treatment for her form of cancer was taking a significant step forward.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tins was among the first wave of <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-c0cc01a0-6dba-11e8-9cdc-6976e533affd">NHS</a> patients to be given immunotherapy — a treatment that uses the patient’s own immune system to battle some cancers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tina, 53, had malignant melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer, which had spread to her bowel and brain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I burst into tears when my consultant told me I had a brain tumour,’ says Tina, who works in retail and lives in Luton, Bedfordshire. ‘But I was diagnosed at exactly the time when new immunotherapy treatments became available.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is proving effective and has most likely prolonged her life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first inkling Tina had that something was seriously wrong was when she suffered three successive epileptic fits at work five years ago.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was taken to hospital by ambulance, and although doctors couldn’t find the cause of the seizures, blood tests revealed she had a low number of white blood cells, which can indicate cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Later, a colonoscopy, where a small telescopic camera is used to examine the bowel, found a tumour in her small intestine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The following month, after a three-hour operation to remove it, lab analysis revealed it was a malignant melanoma that had spread.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The original skin cancer could not be found.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If melanoma — which is associated with skin damage from sun exposure — is caught early, it can be removed. However, if it has spread, then the chances of survival are vastly reduced because melanomas are resistant to standard treatments such as chemotherapy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the operation to remove the tumour, Tina underwent full body CT scans every three months. In September 2014, a scan showed the cancer had returned.</p><img id="i-2d25c4f4ff9054da" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/21/4D23FF0B00000578-0-image-m-16_1528750172229.jpg" height="443" width="306" alt="After the operation to remove the tumour, Tina underwent full body CT scans every three months.

It was by far the worst news I’d been given.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Because of the position of the tumour in the area of her brain just above her left ear, it could not be surgically removed. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy were also unlikely to work.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But her oncologist told her she was an ideal candidate for immunotherapy treatment, which had recently been made available on the NHS.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Treating cancer with immunotherapy is about activating your own immune system to attack the cancer, says Professor Alan Melcher, a clinician scientist at the Institute for Cancer Research.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tina was given a drug called ipilimumab — the first modern immunotherapy drug to be given approval for NHS patients in 2012 — which is thought to work by attaching itself to immune cells called T-cells.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Normally a protein in the T-cell called CTL4-A is able to ‘switch off’ when it isn’t needed to fight disease. Ipilimumab blocks this protein so the immune system is turned back on and destroys cancer cells.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are only a handful of immunotherapy drugs available, including ipilimumab and nivolumab (often used together) and pembrolizumab, which works in a similar way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also available is an immunotherapy treatment called T-VEC, a modified herpes virus that attacks cancer cells and directs the immune system to attack the tumour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Melanoma was among the first cancers to be treated with immunotherapy because early research suggested it might be responsive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Professor John Gribben, a haematologist at The London Clinic, says: ‘Malignant melanoma isn’t very sensitive to traditional treatment because the cells that make up these cancers are mutated, so it’s hard to tackle them successfully with one type of drug.</p><img id="i-4eabf6d435a4fec2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/21/4D24879E00000578-0-image-a-5_1528748713561.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="Normally a protein in the T-cell called CTL4-A is able to ¿switch off¿ when it isn¿t needed to fight disease. Ipilimumab blocks this protein so the immune system is turned back on and destroys cancer cells" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But with immunotherapy, you’re unleashing the whole force of the immune system against the tumour. By attacking the cancer cells from different directions, we’re finding it is more effective.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Immunotherapy drugs have also shown promising signs in treating lung, kidney, bladder, and head and neck cancers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last week, scientists at the Institute of Cancer Research said they’d showed for the first time that pembrolizumab could improve outcomes in men with advanced prostate cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Immunotherapy is a game-changer in all types of cancer,’ says Professor Gribben.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In December 2014, Tina was given ipilimumab infusions once every three weeks. She also had one radiotherapy treatment on her brain tumour. However, scans a few months later revealed neither treatment had shrunk the tumours.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘My consultant had said immunotherapy might not work instantly, but I knew things weren’t looking good for me and I started to put my affairs in order,’ says Tina, who is married to Graham.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then, in September 2015, the drug pembrolizumab was approved for NHS patients. As well as melanomas, this can be used to treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘When my consultant said we could try it, I was delighted,’ says Tina, who started the drug in December 2015.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-11553310-6db3-11e8-9cdc-6976e533affd">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Tiny tweaks</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                            <p class="mol-para-with-font">Keep walking if you have bad knees.

This deprives the bacterium (Cutibacterium acnes) which causes the red, inflamed skin, of food.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to nhs figures, four out of five people who take isotretinoin have clear skin after one course of the drug — with a typical course lasting between four and six months.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The concerns that your daughter expresses about taking it, however, are not without foundation, and for this reason GPs are not permitted to prescribe isotretinoin — it has to be prescribed by a dermatologist who then retains the patient under their care.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The drug is associated with multiple side-effects which include dryness of the skin, cracked lips, itching, nosebleeds, muscle ache, and dry, gritty eyes.</p><img id="i-1caac4b3fe7a001d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/21/4D2486CE00000578-5832279-image-a-4_1528748392362.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The drug is associated with multiple side-effects which include dryness of the skin, cracked lips, itching, nosebleeds, muscle ache, and dry, gritty eyes" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">These can be eased to a large extent by emollients and skin care and usually resolve once the medication ceases.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It should not be taken by women who might conceive, because of risks to the baby.

Adding to this is the fact some gyms offer introductory ‘bundles’ of classes that must be taken in a short period of time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘You can end up doing seven spinning classes in a week, far more than your body can take,’ says personal trainer Max Lowery, author of The 2 Meal Day.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s not just an anecdotal problem; studies such as one published in the Journal of the Norwegian Medical Association in 2016 reported an increase in the number of reported cases of rhabdomyolysis triggered by exercise at hospitals across Norway. And doctors say the same is happening here.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Exertion-related rhabdomyolysis is a growing problem and we are seeing more cases in A&amp;E,’ says Dr Shruti Goel, a consultant in renal and acute medicine at Hillingdon NHS Hospital Trust.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rhabdomyolysis happens when not enough oxygen reaches the cells to keep up with the demand being placed upon them. As a result the muscle tissue breaks down, releasing toxins into the blood which can seriously damage the kidneys.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In many cases this causes no symptoms, and the muscles simply ‘heal’. In fact, this is how bigger muscles are built.</p><img id="i-d2813d212ecc9781" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/21/4D24763100000578-5832217-image-a-41_1528747434431.jpg" height="425" width="634" alt="Motivational instructors, pumping soundtracks and a party vibe all add to the draw of sessions that often take place in dim light to add to the club-like atmosphere" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, if this process happens too fast or for too long, the resulting muscle breakdown releases large quantities of minerals such as potassium and phosphate (normally stored in muscle tissue). It also triggers the release of myoglobin (which carries oxygen to the muscles) into the blood, a combination which can be toxic to the kidneys and affect heart rhythms. It can progress to a medical emergency and could even prove fatal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘After intense exercise, the myoglobin can crystallise, causing damage and blockage of the renal tubules, leading to serious kidney injury,’ says Dr Peter Hill, a consultant nephrologist at Hammersmith Hospital in London.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, in serious cases of rhabdo, someone can stop passing urine completely.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The tubules may recover after several days or weeks, but sometimes the damage is irreversible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Initial symptoms are subtle, says Dr Hill. ‘Muscle pain and swelling which doesn’t settle quickly is one sign,’ he says. Other symptoms of rhabdo include nausea, dark urine (a bit like cola), fever, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Getting enough fluid into the body is the first and most important treatment and in the most severe cases doctors use bicarbonate to help flush the myoglobin particles out of the kidneys,’ says Dr Hill.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Around 4 per cent of those who develop exertion-related rhabdomyolysis go on to develop acute kidney injury — usually 12 to 24 hours after the initial muscle damage — and may need dialysis, where blood is taken out of the body and cleaned by a machine.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-7ec6e060-6dae-11e8-8a1e-a39b0c9441c5">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Did you know?</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                            <p class="mol-para-with-font">Having a strong social network could hold the key to preserving memory.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A study conducted in mice showed those housed in groups of seven performed better in tests of memory and had healthier brains than those that lived in pairs, reports the journal Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Previous research has suggested that being social increases connections in the hippocampus important for memory function.</p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rhabdomyolysis can also happen when someone is crushed, for exampled during an earthquake or car crash, and the muscle tissue is damaged. In fact, the first medical description of rhabdo came from treating people who’d been trapped under bombed buildings during World War II.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In very rare cases, it’s a side-effect of drugs such as statins.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rhabdomyolysis as a result of over-exertion can be accompanied by compartment syndrome. Here, the damaged muscle starts to swell within the tough sheath encasing it called the fascia. In spinning this often happens to the thigh muscles as pedalling puts these under particular strain, but runners usually get it in the calf.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Surgery may be needed to release pressure on the muscle so that the tissue doesn’t start to die,’ says Dr Hill.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘People talk about “smashing” their workout but end up smashing their bodies,’ adds Max Lowery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I have been in gyms where clients have collapsed and been sick after spinning classes. In most cases, they are OK after a rest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘No one is saying spinning per se is bad, but it’s an advanced fitness regimen and not for newbies. That said, you can get rhabdo even if you’re fit, but haven’t been training or aren’t used to spinning.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most people who suffer exertion-induced rhabdo are first timers. In April 2017, the American Journal of Medicine published a study involving 46 people who had fallen ill after a spin class: 42 of them had been admitted to hospital after their first attempt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Spin classes are designed to get the most out of participants, using peer pressure and loud music.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘This can mean that people feel pressured to push themselves beyond what is comfortable,’ says Kathryn Freeland, a personal trainer and owner of Stede Court Private Fitness Retreat.</p><img id="i-ff757a4cbea64490" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/21/4D24763D00000578-5832217-image-a-42_1528747520951.jpg" height="420" width="634" alt="The draw is rapid weight loss — a session lasting 40 minutes to an hour can burn 600 calories and provide a full-body workout" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Yes, you can put your bike on a lower setting, but the whole ethos is to push yourself beyond your max. People don’t realise they might be putting themselves at risk.’ Kathryn Freeland says that there is a wider culture of training to — or beyond — the limit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Think of HIIT (high-intensity interval training) and the number of people competing in triathlons and ultramarathons despite relatively little training,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘They try to get the max out of their bodies when they are new to exercise, or to that exercise, so they go too far. They need to gradually introduce a new discipline.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fit people can get rhabdomyolysis if they push themselves too hard or try a new exercise that works a different muscle group.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So ARE instructors, who determine the level of intensity, aware of the risks? ‘I’ve seen good and bad instructors and unfortunately bad ones may not even have heard of rhabdo,’ says Max Lowery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are no set requirements for becoming a fitness instructor, although most gyms employ those with at least a certificate in Fitness Instructing. These qualifications often involve part-time courses and few touch on rhabdomyolysis. ‘There’s a wide range of abilities and knowledge levels within the fitness industry,’ says Max Lowery. ‘I’ve seen trainers who are overweight or have very poor understanding of physiology.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He advises people getting into exercise for the first time to start with low-impact cardiovascular training such as walking or cycling combined with flexibility exercises such as Pilates or yoga. And always tell your instructor you are a first-timer so they can tailor the workout to you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Do this for a couple of months and then start with spinning or other high-intensity workouts, but no more than once or twice a week so your body has time to recover.’</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Motivational instructors, pumping soundtracks and a party vibe all add to the draw of sessions that often take place in dim light to add to the club-like atmosphere. But while it’s one thing to finish an exercise class feeling high on endorphins with muscles aching, it’s quite another to collapse and be rushed to A&amp;E suffering acute kidney failure. But that’s what’s happening to an increasing number of spinning enthusiasts — particularly first-timers — who are being admitted to hospital with symptoms that resemble traumatic crush injuries.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Jessica Green</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T23:20:14.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>How spin classes can cause the same type of injuries as car crashes</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T23:20:14.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5829151/Toddler-parents-advised-terminate-pregnancy-approaching-birthday.html" title="'She came to this world to teach us not to give up': Proud parents of toddler born with a ‘crown on her head' slam medics who told them to ABORT her as she defies the odds to reach her third birthday "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5831303/Al-desko-dining-making-FAT-Workers-eat-thousands-calories-vending-machine-junk.html" title="'Al desko' dining is making you FAT: Workers eat thousands of empty calories lunching on junk from vending machines and cafeterias, CDC study finds"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5831503/Suicide-prevention-calls-jumped-25-week-deaths-Kate-Spade-Anthony-Bourdain.html" title="Suicide hotline calls jumped 25% last week after the deaths of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain - but the group is struggling for funds to cope with the soaring demand"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5829107/Heartwarming-footage-captures-moment-19-month-old-girl-sits-herself.html" title="Heartwarming footage captures the moment a 19-month-old girl who has spent the whole of her life in hospital sits up by herself for the first time"></link></item><item><title>Suicide hotline calls jumped 25% last week after the deaths of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain - but the group is struggling for funds to cope with the soaring demand</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5831503/Suicide-prevention-calls-jumped-25-week-deaths-Kate-Spade-Anthony-Bourdain.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2018 18:39:58 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5831503</guid><description><![CDATA[The number (1-800-273-8255) directs callers to one of more than 150 crisis centers around the US, where trained counselors are on-hand 24 hours a day for support.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p class="mol-para-with-font">For many, the idea of working out in the morning induces a mixed reaction of awe and disgust.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But most of us also struggle to meet the minimum recommended amount of exercise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By the time we clock off work, we have built up an encyclopedia of excuses to skip the gym - telling ourselves, yet again, that we'll do it tomorrow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anna Magee, health writer and editor of Healthista, is one of those fabled people who manages to get out and exercise at 6am. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, she speaks to the experts about the major stumbling blocks we all face, and how to get past them. </p><img id="i-f2daf2537ef8dc44" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/18/4D23CC0E00000578-5831621-image-a-4_1528737406160.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Exercise is a virtually guaranteed mood boost for the day. Anna Magee, who actually does ¿ honestly ¿ get up and exercise at 6am, talks to the experts" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1. Tell yourself it only takes 10 minutes</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You're probably familiar with the term 'Runner's High', the feeling of increased well-being that people who plod the pavement regularly get extremely evangelical about. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But if you assumed it took hours of tedious jogging to get that famed high, new research suggests you would be wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, according to the study just ten minutes – ten little minutes – of exercise a day can deliver that famed high, as long as it's high intensity cardio such as as cycling, running or swimming.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The research by YouGov, commissioned by online sports retailer Wiggle.co.uk, surveyed 2,000 British adults about the transition between motivating yourself to exercise and enjoying it while you do. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They found that the average time for those who exercise three times a week or more was just nine minutes, 44 seconds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So those excuses about not having enough time? They no longer wash – more on that later.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. Ask yourself what kind of a day you want to have </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ask anyone who exercises regularly and they will tell you this – it's not the body effects of exercise that keep them coming back day after day or get them out of bed to exercise each morning.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's how exercise makes them feel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Done at the beginning of a day, exercise is one way to fortify yourself against the mood-dampening effects of nasty emails, bad-tempered bosses and other niggling nightmares the day might bring. It simply makes you feel better for longer. And it's the best drug-free way to guarantee yourself a better mood.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Even a short burst of intense skipping, aerobics or dancing in your bedroom for 5-10 minutes in the morning is going to make you feel better and give you a better mindset for the rest of the day,' says leading sports psychologist Michael Caulfield, who has coined this effect 'youphoria'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For years, scientists have associated this phenomenon with increased levels of β-endorphins in the blood, opioid peptides thought to elevate mood.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But according to Caulfield, there's more at work. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dopamine is the neurotransmitter in the brain that is released when we get rewards. It's the same pathway that lights up when people eat sugar, drink alcohol or snort cocaine. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Well, exercise gives you the same thing but without the fat, hangover or horrendous comedown. And like the addictive stuff, exercise is habit-forming too (good news, it takes just 14 days or exercising to form that habit).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Dopamine is released in the brain when something happens to make us feel good, such as falling in love,' says Caulfield. 'In not so good-for-you terms, that means making money, addictions and so on. That same rush comes from exercise too.' Plus, unlike cocaine or gin, with exercise there's no come down.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. Figure out the moves that work and do them</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what moves can get you this euphoric feeling and how long do they take?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to the Wiggle research, runners took just eight minutes and 28 seconds to get their exercise high, while those who walked/hiked took ten minutes 35 seconds and exercise classes delivered it nine minutes and seven seconds. Gym goers got their high the fastest, in just six minutes, 36 seconds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If that doesn't get you out of bed nothing will.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a general rule of thumb, Caulfield says if you want the high faster, you need to exercise at a higher intensity. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Kick boxing, sprinting, skipping or fast-paced dancing and aerobics will get you there quickly because of the effect they have on the blood circulation and the heart which then send signals to the brain to release the feel good chemicals. A gentle walk in the park will still make you feel good, but it might take longer.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4. Know the science on exercise and the brain </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lacking motivation is the most popular reason not to exercise, according to 33 percent of the Brits surveyed. One way to combat that is to know the actual scientific effects of exercise on the brain that you simply cannot argue with (or talk yourself out of) whatever the time of day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you need proof of the science behind the effects of exercise on the brain, watch a TED talk currently trending by Dr Wendy Suzuki, professor of neuroscience at New York University.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So convinced is Dr Suzuki of the mood and brain-enhancing effects of exercise, that she also became a fitness instructor.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Moving your body has immediate, protective and long-lasting effects on your brain,' says Dr Suzuki. There is an exciting and a growing scientific body of literature that shows the effects of exercise on the brain, Suzuki asserts. 'Better mood, better energy, better memory, better attention,' she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'A single workout that you do will immediately increase levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline which increases your mood right after and that focus improvement will last for at least two hours,' says Dr Suzuki.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Short-term exercise will also improve your attention and focus, Suzuki asserts, and over time, doing it regularly will protect your brain against Alzheimer's and depression. Sign us up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5. Set incremental goals </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also known as mini-goals, incremental goals are small, achievable milestones you set on the way to a bigger goal. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They're not only easier to achieve but the sense of accomplishment you get in ticking them off as done gives you yet another hit of that famed dopamine we've been talking about, thus increasing your confidence to take on the next incremental goal and the next and so on. See how this works, now?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, by all means, set your long-term goal of, say, wanting to lose ten pounds by the time you go on holidays in August.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But then, set incremental goals weekly and even daily so you have something to feel good about before you achieve the weight loss. It's how all the best athletes get to their goals, smart goal setting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your weekly goal might be to do four gym workouts and one outside run. Great. Get your long-term and weekly goals written down in a journal and come back to the journal with any trials or challenges you're facing and to track your progress.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But then, the real key to success, says Michael Caulfield, is to write down your incremental goals for the next day the night before. Each day, make your tiny goal achievable and specific to that day, he advises.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Goal setting is an art that once you learn, can really work for you,' says Caulfield. 'In my experience people set themselves massive goals such as running a marathon or losing ten kilos, but their motivation drops quickly when they haven't achieved it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Tiny, incremental goals give you achievable tasks along the way to a bigger goal and they work to get you to the bigger goal.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what's the secret to, say, becoming that person that gets up to run/bike/swim/gym at 6am? 'Well, we know something done for 14 days can quickly become a habit,' says Caulfield.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Write down your goal each evening. Write down everything you need to do to achieve it the next morning. Set alarm, get up, put on trainers, run for 10 minutes. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Then, along with the kit you need, put the note by the bed so you'll see them as soon as you wake up. Once you have written down your incremental goal and done it within the next 24 hours it's easier to commit to doing it again the next day, and then the next.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'As human beings, we crave routines, and within 14 days, it's likely this can become routine for you'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-large health-ccox">6. Separate your excuses from your reasons</span></strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Motivated people have reasons for not exercising, but they don't make excuses. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'A reason is something outside of your control. For example, the day before you may have seriously injured yourself, or you have to be at Heathrow to get on a very early flight,' says Caulfield.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But an excuse is something within your control, it's a choice you're making not to exercise that isn't a reason, but something you're convincing yourself is valid but is really only putting exercise way down your priorities list for the day. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'For example, "I'm too tired, too busy, I'll do it tomorrow" are all excuses and they're within your control to change.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>7. Find your daily why </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why do you want to get up at 6am to exercise? Just as you need a good reason not to exercise, likewise, you need to dig deep and find out exactly why you want to get up before the sparrows do and exercise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's not enough to just want to lose the weight, a real why is emotional, and it's immediate which means it will give you benefits, not only in three months or three years, but later that day too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That's where Michael Caulfield's ten-minute 'Youphoria' effect comes back into it; Dr Wendy Suzuki's immediate feelgood factor. Call it what you like, it's going to make you feel better, look better, work better and smile more that day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Especially in the first 14 days, make sure you write down your why the night before you wake up,' Caulfield advises. The Wiggle research found that for a staggering 78 per cent of Brits, said improved wellbeing and health was their big why.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But your daily why can be simpler, and for best motivation more specific.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How do you want exercise to make you feel that day? What immediate effect do you want it to have on your life?

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Most heart attack survivors develop terminal heart failure that confines them to a lifetime of weakness and agony - but a new device could prevent that. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The device, developed by MIT and Harvard researchers, delivers drugs straight to the heart through a tube <span style="font-size: 16px;">to prevent the heart from repairing itself badly.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After an attack, the heart rushes to patch up the scarred vessels. The process is remarkable but imperfect, and usually results in 'valve failure', narrowing avenues that need to be open or blocking some altogether. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While we have the right drugs to prevent it, there is no effective method that keeps the drugs in the right place for long enough.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But a new study, published today, claims to have the answer: researchers designed a port that fits under the patients' skin connecting to a 'refill line' that delivers drugs direct to the vessels - and have already prevented or reversed heart disease in rat models. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The device has been hailed as a breakthrough in targeted drug delivery - and may even be used for other conditions, including diabetes.</p><img id="i-fcdf76df70594314" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/16/4D231F8100000578-5830351-image-m-2_1528729423589.jpg" height="561" width="634" alt="The device implanted into a heart attack survivors body could deliver targeted drugs that save them from a lifetime of agony and weakness from heart disease" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'After a heart attack we could use this device to deliver therapy to prevent a patient from getting heart failure,' explains Professor Ellen Roche, co-first author of the study, who started the research during her PhD at Harvard and concluded it in her current role as assistant professor of mechanical engineering at MIT.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If the patient already has some degree of heart failure, we can use the device to attenuate the progression.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This has been a really exciting study which opens a lot of research questions and could be used for many other applications,' she added. 'It's only just the start.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Currently, there are two ways to get drugs to the heart in the wake of a heart attack if the patient is stabilized. Neither method, however, is seen as at all effective. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">First, the patient can simply ingest the drugs orally, loading their body with ACE inhibitors (such as Lotensin or Altace), which are designed to prevent the arteries from narrowing. However, given the risk of side effects to other parts of the body, the patient cannot take a high enough dose to be sure it will work.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'From a pharmacological point-of-view, it's a big problem that you're injecting something that doesn't stay at the damaged tissue long enough to make a difference,' says William Whyte, co-first author and PhD candidate at Trinity College Dublin and AMBER.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Failing that, the patient can undergo multiple invasive heart surgeries to inject the drug directly into the heart muscle - but this, clearly, comes with another set of debilitating side effects that can render the entire process futile.  </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new device, named Therepi, involves one invasive procedure to implant it, before limitless targeted refills without having to open up the patient again. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Professor Roche worked with a team of researchers in the US and Ireland to design a reservoir that would be flexible, could adapt to the human body, and allow cells to grow around it. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They settled on a gelatin-based polymer tube that runs through the body. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This connects to a flat bottomed port, which attaches to the diseased tissue, made of semi-permeable membrane.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It means the reservoir becomes a 'cell factory', keeping the cells there where they produce vital ingredients to healed damaged tissue, rather than passing through the membrane into the heart.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a rat model, the device was shown to be effective in improving cardiac function after a heart attack. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The researchers administered multiple doses of cells to a damaged heart throughout a four-week period. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They then analyzed the hemodynamic changes in the tissue using a pressure volume catheter and used echocardiography to compare functional changes over time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The malleable material can be reshaped to allow more drugs to pass directly into the heart tissue.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The material we used to construct the reservoir was crucial. We needed it to act like a sponge so it could retain the therapy exactly where you need it,' Dr Whyte added. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'That is difficult to accomplish since the heart is constantly squeezing and moving.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The reservoir provides a unique opportunity for administering stem cell therapies, and it goes beyond treating heart disease. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We are hoping to use the device itself as a research tool to learn more about the optimal drug loading regime,' says Roche.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the first time, researchers could have an opportunity to track multiple refills of localized therapies over time to help identify the best dosing intervals and dose amount.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'As a pharmacist by training, I'm really excited to start investigating what the best dose is, when is the best time to deliver after a heart attack, and how many doses are needed to achieve the desired therapeutic effect,' adds Whyte. </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>After an attack, the heart rushes to patch itself up but that usually results in 'valve failure', narrowing avenues that need to be open.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">There has been much talk about this in theory, but now years of hard work and scientific study are producing breakthroughs that mean the outlook is truly one of optimism.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what does it all mean for British cancer patients today, and how can the average person benefit?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I put that very question to the UK’s leading cancer specialists to find out…</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>NO MORE CHEMO FOR EARLY BREAST CANCER</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHAT’S IT ALL ABOUT?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The announcement that the majority of women with early-stage breast cancer, of the most common type, can safely forgo chemotherapy generated huge excitement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All women will still be offered surgery to remove the cancer. However, after being given a genetic test, a decision can be made as to whether this is followed by chemotherapy and hormone-blocking drugs, or the latter alone, said researchers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR ME?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Consultant oncologist Dr Hendrik-Tobias Arkenau, Medical Director at Sarah Cannon Research UK, said: ‘The type of breast cancer looked at in the study was hormone-receptor positive, HER2-negative, and node negative – if you have this, you’ll recognise the terms – which represents roughly half of all diagnoses.</p><img id="i-4ad55853ce3e67fc" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/18/4CE3955300000578-0-image-a-35_1528563608683.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="The American Society of Clinical Oncology held the conference in Chicago, pictured " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘About 70 per cent of these women may be able to avoid chemo, without any raised risk of their cancer returning.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The key is the genetic test, the Oncotype DX test, which is widely used in the NHS.

First, immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab was shown to be more effective than chemotherapy for patients with advanced, incurable cases of the most common type of lung cancer. It gave the majority of them about four to eight months more life, with fewer side effects, when compared to chemo.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The surface of the cancer cells were studied for the presence of markers that indicate whether it will be sensitive to the drug.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And there was hope for better screening for those at high risk of lung cancer – such as smokers – as early-stage trials showed DNA blood tests could accurately detect the disease at an early stage, before it causes symptoms.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-0a92bdc0-6c07-11e8-a260-bf7d5f30c8ee">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Health comment by BARNEY CALMAN </h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">I've always liked the idea of precision medicine – bespoke, made-to-measure treatments. You just know that’s going to be better than off-the-shelf options such as chemotherapy, right? But what does it really mean...</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Well, at the heart of the approach is the fact that cancer cells have their own genetic code. Although a tumour grows from our own tissue, its genes are different from our own, due to DNA mutations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has long been known that cancer isn’t one disease, but many. Breast cancer is different to lung cancer, which is different to prostate cancer, and so on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But now it is clear that even within a single type of cancer there are scores of genetic variations. And doctors are becoming better at telling them apart. This knowledge has led to an array of medications that target specific weaknesses in each type of cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some prime the body’s own immune system to seek and destroy the disease or act as Trojan horses, breaking into tumour cells and causing them to self-destruct. Other drugs inhibit the mechanisms that cause tumour cells to divide. These can work alone or in combination, meaning a wealth of treatment possibilities.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Specialists can choose the right treatment for the right patient. Surgery, chemo, radiotherapy and hormone drug treatments are still the mainstay. But one study announced last week suggested that patients given molecular profiling for their cancer had up to six times the chance of still being alive ten years later than those who didn’t. It’s hugely encouraging, and proof that thanks to the tireless efforts of medical science, we are coming closer to conquering this killer.</p></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR ME?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Consultant oncologist Professor Siow-Ming Lee, an expert in lung cancer at University College Hospital London, said: ‘The immune system should attack anything that shouldn’t be in the body, such as a tumour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But many cancers seem to evade detection by giving off signals that interfere with the way immune cells recognise an “invader”.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Pembrolizumab, which is a type of immunotherapy, works by blocking those signals. This allows the immune system to “see” it and attack it, clearing the cancer from the body.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Today, we can test tumour biopsies to find out whether pembrolizumab will have an effect. In about a third of cases it may do.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘For those patients who we think it will benefit, we will apply to the Cancer Drugs Fund for them to be given the treatment. In those patients, we know it will extend life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘However, it won’t work for everyone. Immunotherapy isn’t recommended for patients who suffer from an autoimmune disease such as Crohn’s or colitis, because it can worsen those conditions, or who have taken immune-suppressing drugs such as steroids, because the two medications cancel each other out.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prof Lee added: ‘More research is needed before we can recommend DNA blood tests to screen for early lung cancer. It will be at least five more years before we see a reliable test like this.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>BACK FROM THE BRINK... THANKS TO ‘LAZARUS’ DRUG</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHAT’S IT ALL ABOUT?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As first revealed in The Mail on Sunday last week, men with terminal prostate cancer could be thrown a lifeline thanks to the ‘Lazarus drug’ pembrolizumab. The patients were those who had undergone chemotherapy and other treatments to no avail. But the effect of pembrolizumab in one in ten men was dramatic. At the start of the trial, some were being ‘eaten alive’ by the disease – but thanks to the treatment they were clear of cancer up to two years later.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR ME?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Consultant oncologist Dr Peter Harper, of Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and co-founder of the London Oncology Clinic, said: ‘A large number of men with prostate cancer are diagnosed at a late stage. Once the disease has spread outside of the prostate, it’s likely to keep coming back – and the problem really isn’t the gland itself any more. So they may well not be offered surgery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Instead, men are given hormone drugs and chemotherapy and this does usually help keep things at bay. But some men don’t respond and we’ve had few options for them. It is this group who would be ideal candidates for pembrolizumab.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘However, it is not licensed in Europe for treating prostate cancer, so we can’t offer it even privately. Even if we could, it’s very expensive – just under £8,000 per injection, and it needs to be given every three weeks. If you live for as long as some on this trial, it could get quite costly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The best bet is getting involved in a clinical trial.

The 2,500 volunteers involved in the trial also took the over-the-counter medication omeprazole, which reduces stomach acid. All the patients involved had Barrett’s oesophagus, a ‘pre-cancerous’ condition in which low-level acid reflux causes cell changes in the lower part of the gullet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sufferers are 50 times more likely than those without the condition to develop oesophageal cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those who took the two daily pills in combination were found to have a 20 per cent lower chance of developing oesophageal cancer than if they had been untreated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While the anti-acid drugs reduce the damage caused by stomach acid, the aspirin is thought to have a dampening effect on the cell division that leads to cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">About 9,000 Britons develop oesophageal cancer and the disease causes 7,900 deaths each year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR ME?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Hendrik-Tobias Arkenau said: ‘I would encourage anyone with Barrett’s oesophagus to see their GP or gastroenterologist and discuss the results of this trial.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘These drugs cost pennies and will help prevent oesophageal cancer.

For those not familiar, this diet, favoured by celebrities such as <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/tvshowbiz/kim_kardashian/index.html" id="mol-b40cf9c0-6bfc-11e8-a260-bf7d5f30c8ee">Kim Kardashian</a> and Megan Fox, is a high-fat, very low-carb regime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The idea is that eating minimal amounts of carbs will force your body to burn fat instead by turning fatty acids in your blood into ketone bodies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The body (and brain) then uses these as fuel instead of glucose from carbohydrates.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Keto is a jazzed-up version of the age-old low-carb, high-fat approach, which was first written about by undertaker William Banting more than 150 years ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Banting, who was 5ft 5in and 14st, wrote a booklet entitled Letter On Corpulence, which detailed his attempts to tackle his obesity by eating a low-carb diet (though he didn’t call it that). He gave up sugar, potatoes, beer and bread and instead stuck largely to meat, greens, fruits and dry wine. He lost 3st in a year, and his book became a bestseller.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And so the low-carb diet was born, popping up in a host of variations throughout history (the Atkins Diet, for example). They are not greeted with much enthusiasm by doctors or dieticians as you have to eat a lot of fat. Clinical trials, however, consistently show that low-carb diets are effective for weight loss, over and above low-fat diets.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But not all carbs are created equal; just as there are good fats and bad fats, there are good carbs and bad carbs. The trick is not to cut carbs completely, but rather to be choosy about the ones you regularly eat. If you want to try going lower-carb then white bread, white pasta, potatoes and sugars, including maple syrup and agave nectar, are best eaten sparingly, if at all. They are easily digestible carbohydrates, meaning they are rapidly absorbed by the body, creating a big spike in your blood-sugar levels.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-1702af70-6bfd-11e8-a260-bf7d5f30c8ee">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Do you have a question for Dr Mosley?  </h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Email drmosley@mailonsunday.co.uk or write to him at The Mail on Sunday, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Mosley can only answer in a general context and cannot give personal replies.</p></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, eat carbohydrates that contain lots of fibre. Fibre reduces the blood sugar spike, provides protection against bowel cancer and feeds the ‘good’ bacteria that live in your guts. Examples include vegetables, legumes – chickpeas and lentils – and wholegrains such as barley, oats, buckwheat, and wholegrain and rye.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A sensible approach to a low-carb diet has been developed and tested by Dr David Unwin, a GP in Southport, who tweets as @lowcarbGP.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">David, winner of the NHS Innovator of the Year award, recommends his overweight patients try to cut out sugar and cut down on white (easily digestible) carbs such as bread, pasta and rice. He recommends eating plenty of blueberries, strawberries and raspberries, which are relatively low in fruit sugar, and green vegetables, protein, butter, full-fat yogurt and olive oil to retain fullness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a recently published study, patients following his advice lost almost 1½st on average, and 6in around the waist. There were big improvements in blood pressure and cholesterol levels too, and many of those with type 2 diabetes were able to come off medication. His GP practice is now saving more than £38,000 a year on its diabetes drug budget alone. Not bad for a ‘fad’ diet…</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>SECOND-DAY PASTA CAN KEEP OFF THE POUNDS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One way to reduce blood-sugar spikes after you eat carbs such as pasta, potatoes or rice is to cook, cool and then reheat them. This was first shown a few years ago when Dr Denise Robertson, of the University of Surrey, asked volunteers who had fasted overnight, to eat pasta with a tomato sauce for breakfast for an experiment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The volunteers either got the pasta hot, cold and or reheated. She discovered that cooking, cooling and reheating the pasta had a dramatic effect, cutting the average rise in their blood sugar levels by 50 per cent. That’s because it changes the structure of the starch in the pasta, making it more resistant to digestive enzymes, so you get smaller blood-sugar spikes. Less of this ‘resistant’ starch is digested, leaving more to travel down and feed the ‘good’ bacteria in the large intestine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since that experiment, a group in Sri Lanka have done something similar with rice. They found that if they cooked rice with coconut oil, cooled it, then reheated it in a microwave, they could increase the levels of resistant starch 15-fold. Animal experiments suggest eating rice this way halves the number of calories you absorb. At the very least it is a good excuse to use up leftover pasta or rice in the fridge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ask Dr Mosley: The 5:2 approach can help boost your memory</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My memory seems to be failing – I forget silly things. I read that fasting diets can help boost memory – should I try one? I am 62 and otherwise healthy.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am a similar age, and also struggle to remember things, particularly names. As the brain ages, some memory loss is normal and is usually nothing to worry about. However, if you are becoming increasingly forgetful, visit the GP who may send you for further tests. Stress, anxiety and sleeping problems can all compromise memory. Memory tricks are useful, such as creating a narrative in your head to help you remember places or names. For instance, remember the name ‘Katherine Grainger’ by imagining a cat throwing some grains in the air. As for fasting diets, when I researched my book The Fast Diet, I noticed animal studies showing that cutting calories a couple of days a week (the 5:2 approach) can lead to the growth of new brain cells, potentially improving cognitive function. We are waiting for the results of human trials, expected later in the year. The best evidence is that eating a Mediterranean diet, rich in oily fish, olive oil, fruits and veg, will slow cognitive decline.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>I was recently diagnosed as diabetic, but am a ‘healthy’ weight, 10st 6lb (I am a 70-year-old man). All the advice about diabetes is related to losing weight – but what should I eat?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Type 2 diabetes, in which blood glucose levels are too high, is a condition that affects three million Britons. Although being overweight or obese increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, about one in four with the condition are a healthy weight. This is because we each have a different fat threshold – the point at which we start getting blood sugar problems. Try a low-carb diet for a fortnight and plenty of exercise and see if that helps.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-fd5ec550-6bfb-11e8-a260-bf7d5f30c8ee">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Moroccan vegetable stew for four </h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><img id="i-f373eee8d7b4f158" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/16/4D13D43E00000578-0-image-a-14_1528559164504.jpg" height="426" width="284" alt="This easy Moroccan vegetable stew serves four people " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Serves 4</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1 tbsp olive oil</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1 red onion, chopped</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1 carrot, chopped</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1 clove garlic, finely chopped</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1 tbsp tomato puree</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1 tsp ground coriander</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1 tsp ground cinnamon</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1 tsp ground cumin</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>½ tsp chilli powder</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1 courgette, chopped</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1 red pepper, chopped</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1 400g can chopped tomatoes</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>300ml vegetable stock</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>50g dried apricots, roughly chopped</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1 lemon, zest and juice</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1 400g can chickpeas</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Small bunch parsley, roughly chopped</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Heat the olive oil in a large casserole dish and cook the onion and carrot for 8-10 minutes until softened, then add the garlic and cook for a further minute. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Add the tomato puree and spices and cook for 2 more minutes. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Add the courgette, pepper, tomatoes, vegetable stock, apricots, lemon zest and chickpeas. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Season and simmer for 20-25 minutes. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stir through the lemon juice and parsley before serving.  </p></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>I have recently returned from a trip to Taiwan where everyone seemed obsessed by the Keto Diet, favoured by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, writes DR MICHAEL MOSLEY.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator></dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-09T22:30:05.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>DR MICHAEL MOSLEY: Low-carb diets DO work and here's the reason why </mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-09T22:30:05.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5825101/Put-feet-sweep-away-grind-everyday-chores-good.html" title="Put your feet up and sweep away the grind of everyday chores for good with the ultimate time saving, grease busting, hassle free housework tips and tricks "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5824725/How-defy-decades-like-Jen-Courteney.html" title="How to defy the decades like Jen an Courteney: Experts reveal the £30,000-a-year aesthetic treatments which could be used by the Hollywood stars "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5824571/Ripping-barns-Including-fabulous-560-000-barn-conversion-Lincolnshire.html" title="Ripping barns: Homes with a whiff of the farmyard... including a this fabulous £560,000 barn conversion in Lincolnshire "></link></item><item><title>DR MAX THE MIND DOCTOR: A lifetime of therapy is the last thing rape victims need</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5823473/DR-MAX-MIND-DOCTOR-lifetime-therapy-thing-rape-victims-need.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jun 2018 00:23:10 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5823473</guid><description><![CDATA[The NHS has pledged that victims of sexual assault will be offered a ‘lifetime of counselling’.

Like Murray, Greer said she refused to live the rest of her life as a ‘rapee’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She then went on to call for the lowering of punishment for rape, saying society should not see it as a ‘spectacularly violent crime’, but view it more as ‘bad sex’. Quite rightly, those latter comments infuriated many who felt that Greer was trivialising rape.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What struck me, though, was the similarly robust response of both women — a reaction that is shared by so many of my patients, men and women.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And at a time when the NHS is advocating ‘evidence-based treatment’, I wonder why a strategy of ‘lifetime counselling’, for which there is no evidence of benefit, is being promoted. On the contrary, there’s good evidence that time-limited therapy best helps those with mental health problems, while periods away from treatment are an opportunity for them to consolidate what they have learned in therapy and to develop their own coping skills.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Too much therapy can lead to them becoming dependent on a therapist and never trying to overcome their problems.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new pledge risks making things worse for patients — so why is the NHS suggesting it?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The real reason, I suspect, is political, rather than medical.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With the spread of the #MeToo movement, being seen to ‘do something’ about sexual violence is in vogue.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the NHS should not be responding to fashionable diktats, but only to what patients need and what is clinically indicated.</p><img id="i-c5e39b7d0b5da64a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/01/4D10AAF700000578-0-Recently_though_there_has_been_a_sea_change_in_attitude_People_a-m-17_1528503697135.jpg" height="432" width="634" alt="Recently, though, there has been a sea-change in attitude.

But suddenly, my confidence rocketed and I wanted to beam at everyone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sadly, orthodontic work is rarely available for adults on the NHS, but I tell everyone that if there is any way they can afford it, it’s worth it to put a smile back on your face and give a massive boost to your self-esteem.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>A caring idea we could use</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In France, a ‘revolutionary’ village is being created for Alzheimer’s patients, where they will live alongside carers, researchers and volunteers and be free to roam unrestricted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The village will have a supermarket, restaurant, hair salon, gym and library, and be set around a central square.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It sounds a wonderful idea, but I hardly think it’s revolutionary.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What the French are doing is re-inventing what was once the norm — where the elderly and vulnerable were cared for within their family and community.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These days, care is outsourced to dreary care homes and it seems we’re only just coming to appreciate what we’ve lost.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">n On the subject of carers, the Government has announced plans to support some six million people nationwide who look after vulnerable relatives, with flexible working arrangements and paid ‘carers’ leave’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The carers need caring for, too.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">May 2016 was supposed to be Ashley's comeback, her first return to the stage after a six-year hiatus from performing with the Chase Brook Experience dance company. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was excited to be dancing again, but otherwise having a standard day, running errands, picking up a bridesmaid dress, rushing to meetings with teachers in the Bronx, New York. She even saw her chiropractor. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Toward the end of that day, May 5, she headed to rehearsal. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I remember feeling good, and having a good time, but it wasn't the hardest I had ever danced. If 10 is the most challenging material, this was a three or a four,' Ashley recalls. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She'd gone just as hard, if not harder, during rehearsals the previous three days that week.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When I'm dancing, I feel my heart is beating, I feel [its pace] increase, and I get tired, and I get out of break, but its just like anyone else running on a treadmill,' she says.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Though she had never been diagnosed or had any cardiac incidents, Ashley's heart was not, in fact like anyone else's. </p><img id="i-46e93f116b1b5319" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/22/4CFD3ACE00000578-5821799-image-a-4_1528491996320.jpg" height="367" width="634" alt="Ashley has been dancing most of her life, either as a student, professional performer, choreographer or teacher, and had never had any issues with her heart before May 2016" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-24d3c8682814c71b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/22/4CFD3B7E00000578-5821799-image-a-8_1528492084832.jpg" height="367" width="634" alt="On May 5 2016, Ashley was in her fourth rehearsal of the week, preparing for her first performance in six years.

The company's owner dialed 9-1-1.  The smallest dancer in the company happened to have taken a CPR course, and jumped to her tall friend's aid and started compressing Ashley's chest.</p><img id="i-91fac3b3930bcdae" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/22/4CFD3B0200000578-5821799-image-a-7_1528492052906.jpg" height="367" width="634" alt="The smallest member of Ashley's dance, Macy Sullivan company (center) knew CPR and jumped into action.

The other five dancers stood in a ring, keeping the beat out loud as the two giving CPR took turns sustaining Ashley for six minutes until the EMTs arrived.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Dancers are so aware by nature, by our training and have trained our whole lives to be able to jump into a situation and be that focused and that is probably what saved my life: that they were smart enough and intuitive and able to put aside fears and anxieties and do what needed to be done,' Ashley says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Well, it was survival part one. If they hadn't done that CPR for those five minutes, I might be alive,' but oxygen wouldn't have gotten to her brain and 'I wouldn't be well enough to talk to you,' she adds.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Paramedics arrived, intubated Ashley and shocked her wit ha defibrillator, restarting her heart. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'For them it was just another call, this is what they do every moment of their days, but they're kind of my friends now, just these 11 strangers that do their damnedest to save somebody's life,' she says. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While the paramedics and her friends were working to save her life, Ashley 'didn't see a white light, I just woke up 16 hours later with an interesting group of people standing around: my husband, his parents, my choreographer, friends, and my mom, who had gotten on a 6am flight,' she says. </p><img id="i-bc030e6097d7a1e6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/23/4D105DF000000578-5821799-image-a-22_1528498123769.jpg" height="424" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-2d38090d5a34bbf9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/23/4D105DFB00000578-5821799-image-m-26_1528498151541.jpg" height="384" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-4d2d3710cd44d384" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/23/4D105E1B00000578-5821799-image-m-25_1528498134344.jpg" height="430" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the hospital, Ashley briefly had the grandiose thoughts of all the ways she might drastically alter her life from then on out, but mostly she is now just glad that her friends and the EMTs brought her back to the life she was living - and still gets to today. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Neither she nor her doctors know exactly why her heart arrested when it did, nor why it never had before, but a defibrillator was placed under Ashley's arm, and she was prescribed beta blockers to help manage her irregular heart beat. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ashley says she was a little nervous to return to dancing, but not so much because of her heart. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Being a dancer, I can feel when the middle of my hamstring is not quite in the right spot, but I can't feel this, the arrhythmia, which is really weird,' she says. Instead, she worried, as all dancers do, about twisting an ankle. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, putting aside her fears, Ashley returned to the stage in December, dancing through 12 shows. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It was a major "oh my god" moment,' she says. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When you make something your career, something you love doing, you start to love it a little less when you make it your career.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'[Cardiac arrest] almost took my life, but to be saved and be able to return to doing it was a really full-circle moment, I was more present, and I didn't think it would be that meaningful, and it really was.'  </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>New York professional dancer Ashley Newman (pictured, all) went into cardiac arrest at the end of a rehearsal when she was just but was saved by CPR given by her fellow dancers (bottom right).

Twenty-two people die every day waiting for an organ. In the US, just 42 percent of Americans have ticked the box on their driver's license form to say they would donate their organs. That figure varies state by state. The lowest is in New York, where fewer the 25 percent are on the <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.organdonor.gov/register.html">organ donation registry</a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That's where the seemingly sci-fi mechanical heart comes in. The device has done wonders to keep our generation alive. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The contraption, also known as an LVAD (left-sided ventricular assist device), is implanted into the patient and acts as a temporary measure to keep their blood pumping. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is a battery-operated device which helps push blood from the heart into the body, taking the weight off the left ventricle, the main pumping chamber of the heart.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The machine, which is plumbed into the base of the heart via the upper abdomen, draws blood from the left ventricle through a pump system and into the aorta, the main artery. </p><img id="i-66b396c9bc064172" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/23/4D10421900000578-5768571-image-a-22_1528496994955.jpg" height="405" width="962" alt="Mechanical hearts (pictured) are now much smaller and more adept at keeping people alive, but they are a temporary measure" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">A cable coming from the device and out of the body via a port is connected to a controller, about the size of a deck of cards, and two mobile phone-sized battery packs, worn in a special harness around the waist.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Crucially, it is a ‘bridge to transplant’, to buy time while a donor organ is found. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is far more sophisticated these days than it was when it first hit the market. At first, it was so big it could only be implanted in big men, and the battery had a tendency to run out - with fatal consequences.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The latest incarnations, including one developed this year, are smaller, with high-powered batteries that are backed-up and do not run out. The newer versions also run a lower risk of infection, since it is made of titanium, meaning the patient can be out of hospital in just two days. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But while a mechanical heart sounds like the future of medicine, it isn't - far from it. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is still cumbersome. Patients have to carry the battery around in a purse, which connects to their heart via a tube that feeds through the side of their body. They also carry the risk of blood clots and stroke, and often an organ does not become available within the few years they can survive on a mechanical heart.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Really, they are waiting for a real heart, which is far superior to anything humans have attempted to create.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When you see this hugely expensive state of the art mechanical machine there’s a feeling of NASA, it’s very dense with technology. But what dwarfs that it the human body itself,' Hillcoat says. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There’s this mechanical heart they’re putting in there, it’s so crude and rigid in comparison to this organic, bleeding, visceral organ pumping away.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Goldstein was part of the creation of every LVAD that's existed, winning awards for his contributions to science along the way.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I thought it was a very interesting story because it highlights technology that’s life-saving - in the past, people like Elena would die, and now there’s this, which we call 'destination therapy' for people who aren’t eligible for a transplant or are waiting for one. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But it also highlights that it's not the goal.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MORE YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE ELENA ARE GETTING HEART DISEASE - DRIVING UP DEMAND FOR TRANSPLANTS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Elena's story is increasingly common among young people as heart woes soar - but donor hearts remain in short supply.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In America, about five million people a year suffer heart failure, of which five percent are young people in an 'end stage' condition.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rate of heart disease, which is the number one killer in every country in the world, is rising. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In America, a quarter of citizens die from heart disease annually, and 735,000 suffer heart attacks every year, according to the latest CDC statistics. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rates are particularly high in low income and impoverished areas - in the US and around the world - where fast food is cheaper  than fresh produce, smoking is prevalent, stress  is rife, and working multiple jobs to survive takes precedent over exercise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Increasingly, poor diet and lack of exercise are plaguing higher income groups too, making an epidemic of heart issues.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But most of the people with heart woes are poor, and for them diagnosis or hands-on care usually comes way too late. That is, in part, because the worst affected tend not to have health insurance, or they live in areas (like the Dominican Republic) where cardiologists are few and far between, and cardiac training for surgeons is scant. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If you look at the entire population of the world, no matter what, the number one cause of death is heart issues. That’s what’s going to kill most people,' Dr Garcia explains. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It’s much more than all the cancers combined. It’s prevalent. And it’s being aggravated by a lot of factors that modern society have brought to us. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There are so many things that led to this epidemic of heart disease. We don’t have the opportunity to live a healthy life, exercise, and eat healthy; we're stressed, smoking, eating too much, becoming obese, developing diabetes.'   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For those like Elena, prospects are bleak.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Their options are to get a  transplant, or a mechanical heart while they wait,' Dr Garcia says. 'There are not enough organs for all those people.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Speaking to DailyMail.com, Bichir said he came on to the movie for the story, the script, and to work with Hillcoat, who is known for his creative indie style of shooting. It wasn't until he was on board that he started to get wind of the critical medical issue they were documenting. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There are constant efforts made to educate people as to how to live a healthy life, but this should be a human right,' Bichir said. 'The right to a high quality universal health care system, to a healthy diet through sufficient food, to a healthy environment to perform sports and develop your intellect.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The film, funded by Montefiore for its <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.corazonfilm.com/home">Give Your Heart</a> campaign, is part of a national drive to increase awareness about the desperate need for organ donation.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It was important to bring up,' Dr Goldstein said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'People don’t realize how easy it is to sign up to the registry, and how important it is. One person can save eight lives, and improve many more with their cornea, bones, skin, and tendons.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Garcia concurred. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Never in my wildest dreams did I think anyone would make a movie about me,' he laughed. 'But the issue is so important. It's a movie about compassion, humanity, and an epidemic that affects us all. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Sometimes you have to go through the moment yourself, when your family member needs an organ, to realize the value of it. I hope maybe people seeing this will see the great importance, and that they can help.'</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT: A new movie, Corazon, tells the true story of Dr Mario Garcia at Montefiore saving the life of a young Dominican woman, Elena Ramirez. The entire movie, filmed by top director John Hillcoat, is acted by stars Ana de Armas (left) and Demien Bichir (top right) - aside from one real scene (pictured) of Montefiore surgeons performing an operation. Elena needed a heart transplant to escape death, but received a mechanical heart as the wait list is years long. Her story touches on one of the biggest crises facing modern medicine: more and more people have heart disease, more need transplants, but there has not been an increase in people joining the donor registry. The movie, currently free in full on its own website , is slated to be available soon on popular video channels YouTube and Vimeo.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Mia DeGraaf</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T14:47:18.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Incredible footage by Hollywood director of New York surgeons</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T14:47:18.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5821971/Incredibly-realistic-organ-replicas-BLEED-let-surgeons-practice-high-stakes-operations.html" title="Incredibly realistic organ replicas that BLEED will let surgeons practice high stakes operations better than ever "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5820887/Sir-Elton-John-praises-late-friend-Princess-Diana-shaking-hands-gay-man-dying-AIDS.html" title="'One gesture showed the world the desperate need for humanity': Sir Elton John praises Princess Diana for shaking hands with a gay man dying of AIDS when a diagnosis was a ‘death sentence’"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5821075/Kanye-West-praised-UKs-psychiatrist.html" title="Kanye West is praised by a top psychiatrist for his 'refreshing' take on his bipolar disorder in his new hit album Ye"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://corazonfilm.com" title="Corazón Film - Presented by Montefiore"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://corazonfilm.com/home" title="Corazón Film - Presented by Montefiore"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.organdonor.gov/register.html" title="Organ Donor Registry | organdonor.gov"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.corazonfilm.com/home" title="Corazón Film - Presented by Montefiore"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.donatelife.net/" title="Donate Life America: Organ, Eye, and Tissue Donation Registration"></link></item><item><title>The rise of male depression: Doctors warn masculinity forces men into loneliness - and makes it harder to confide in others about mental health</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5823159/Doctors-warn-masculinity-forces-men-loneliness-harms-mental-health.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2018 22:46:04 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5823159</guid><description><![CDATA[In the wake of Anthony Bourdain's suicide, two experts warn that a culture that teaches men not to communicate leaves them alone and unable to address their mental health concerns.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="mol-para-with-font">As the world reels in the wake of Anthony Bourdain's suicide, experts warn he is just one of many men whose suicides and preceding struggles with mental illness often go overlooked.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Men in the US kill themselves at 3.5-times the rate that women do but may be less likely to seek medical help or community support. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bourdain spoke openly and often about his own <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-b9157a80-6b6d-11e8-9060-e3ef76660d75">depression</a> and fight to stay sober, but his fame and fortune may well have disguised even deeper troubles.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The tragedy of his death ought to serve as a wake up call to men that their mental health is just as crucial to their survival as their physical health is, two doctors told Daily Mail Online. </p><img id="i-f1ad4114bfad51ca" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/23/4D0FC58E00000578-5823159-image-a-20_1528497166592.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="On Friday, celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain committed suicide at age 61, but experts warn he is only one of tens of thousands of men whose mental health concerns go overlooked " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yesterday, the Centers for Disease Control released its latest suicide data, revealing that nearly 45,000 people committed suicide in 2016. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If estimates that seven out of 10 of these people are men hold true, then more as many as 31,500 men took their own lives that year. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Among the leading theories for why suicide is so much more prevalent among men than women is that men are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Jonathan Gerkin, a University of North Carolina psychiatrist who says he takes a therapist's approach believes that our culture - particularly in the US, but worldwide - has not conditioned men to be reflective about, let alone accepting of their own emotions, and that can lead them to a profound sense of loneliness. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Loneliness is such an attention-grabbing feeling, and if men can't reflect and respond to that, they can get caught up in trying to eliminate those feelings by minimizing, acting macho, or acting out in dangerous ways,' including substance misuse, he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Acting out can be outward, or it can be self-directed, like taking one's life,' Dr Gerkin adds. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says that this isolation happens to men who are not 'lucky to encounter more acceptance, or be raised in a family that encourages it, or to be exposed to it in therapy.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But by adulthood, many of these opportunities have already passed men by, or they have already been taught to seek help is seen as not a masculine behavior, leaving them unsure where to even begin when they are confronting mental health issues. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'That's the hard question,' admits Dr Gerkin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'On one hand, to seek it out, you have to have the motivation or level of insight that requires.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But...say you have a male friend you think is struggling with something like this. You don't want to whack them over the head with "something is wrong with you, you should get therapy," because then they're more likely to feel invalidated and act out,' says Dr Gerkin. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He suggests that we all take a more subtle approach to discussing mental health with the men in our lives. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'First, be present and, as much as you can, engage the person in whatever activities are healthy and they're interested in at the time,' Dr Gerkin says. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Through being engaged with them and sort of listening and asking permission to hear about their struggles, and just being with them might be an opportunity to share you you've dealt with things or suggest going to psychotherapy.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One group has found a simple metaphor for the body to help them discuss both physical and mental health with men in the US. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'For mental health, we use car as a kind of magnet to get guys to come see us,' Dr Jamin Brahmbhatt says. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Brahmbhatt is a urologist at the University of Florida, but each year he goes on the road with other doctors for Drive for Men's Health.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Without fail, mental health - including issues of body image - come up during their stops.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We use the analogy of the car to talk about health.  Just like a car get manuel tells you when to get things checked - not just physical but mental health - when those warning signals go off in your body, you go get that checked out.'  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the case of men's mental health and suicide ideation, some of the warning signs include 'feeling hopeless, trapped, burden to society, start withdrawing from people, having severe mood swings, drinking a lot more,' Dr BrahmbHatt says. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like Dr Gerkin, he points out that the watchfulness of friends, family and doctors may be especially key to men's mental health.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If a guy can talk about it great, but these are warning signs we can look out for in our friends, because it's hard to dig themselves out of hole. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Just like in car, someone driving might not be able to hear the squeaky breaks, but someone else outside just might,' he says. </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>In the wake of Anthony Bourdain's suicide, two experts warn that a culture that teaches men not to communicate leaves them alone and unable to address their mental health concerns.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Natalie Rahhal</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-09T00:14:42.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Doctors warn masculinity makes men lonely and harms mental health</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-09T00:14:42.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5817229/CDC-report-reveals-45-000-took-lives-2016.html" title="Another spike in suicides - particularly among women: CDC report reveals more than 45,000 Americans took their own lives in 2016 (and most were NOT diagnosed with a mental health condition beforehand)"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5792735/Suicide-rate-doctors-highest-profession-DOUBLE-general-population.html" title="Suicide rate of doctors is the highest of any profession and DOUBLE that of the general population, study finds "></link></item><item><title>Autism may be linked to food allergies: Children on the spectrum are TWICE as likely to have had bad reactions, study finds</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5821291/Children-autism-TWICE-likely-food-allergies.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2018 15:06:33 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5821291</guid><description><![CDATA[Food allergies are two-and-a-half times more common among children with autism than others, a University of Iowa study finds, adding evidence to the theory that autism is an autoimmune condition.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Firstly, </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">it thickens mucus that lives on the cervix, which blocks and traps the sperm.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Secondly, it stops eggs from leaving the ovaries so any sperm that gets through has no egg to fertilize.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">IUDs are one of the most effective forms of birth control that require little maintenance.</span></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">They are 99 percent effective - meaning fewer than one out of 100 women who use an IUD will get pregnant each year - and they can last anywhere from three to six years, meaning it is favored among health experts.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Other forms of birth control - including the birth control, shot, the birth control patch, the contraceptive pill, and the vaginal ring - are also 99 percent effective when used perfectly.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">However, when it comes to typical use, these rates vary.

bigger impact on their life in almost every category when compared to boys.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The girls said they were more likely to miss school, to feel less motivated at school, to skip social activities and to feel tired during classes throughout the day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They were also more likely to nap at weekends, but there was no difference between the genders when they were asked about falling asleep at school or drinking coffee or energy drinks to help themselves stay up during the day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to the Sleep Foundation teenagers need eight to ten hours of sleep a night, but many do not get it because of the distractions of modern life, and because their bedtimes get later as they get older.</p><p

<p class="mol-para-with-font">What are the hallmarks of a good doctor? Technical expertise and skill, of course — but someone who understands you, someone you trust, is also vital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, research shows that a good relationship with your doctor can improve the chances of a successful outcome. But how do you find a specialist who fits the bill?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That’s where this unique series of guides, running every day this week in the Mail, can help.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’ve identified the country’s top consultants — as judged by their peers. We’ve canvassed the views of more than 260 consultants across seven specialties from around the country, and asked them this very simple, but key, question: If your own nearest and dearest were to need treatment in your field, to whom would you refer them — and why?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The consultants who earned the most votes from their peers are the ones who made it into our guides — though patients should bear in mind that this is not a scientific study.</p><img id="i-56fa2acb9c603088" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/22/4CFD0F4300000578-5814197-image-a-1_1528319395976.jpg" height="920" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, of course, there are many superb and highly skilled specialists all over the country who didn’t make it on to our list, but who spend every day transforming patients’ lives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To help you make informed decisions about your care, we’ve also talked to experts about the latest thinking on treatment. Today, we focus on knee replacement surgery...</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>It can make sense to delay surgery</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Knee replacement surgery is the most common type of joint replacement operation in the UK, and the number of patients having the procedure is rising.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The average age for getting a new knee is 69, but what worries some experts is that the percentage of younger people going under the knife for this major procedure is on the rise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Almost 110,000 knee replacements were carried out on the NHS and privately in the UK (excluding Scotland) in 2016 — 30 per cent more than in 2010.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And osteoarthritis — wear and tear of the joint that causes pain and deformity — is the reason for virtually all cases.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Obesity is partly blamed for the boost in demand from younger patients; a joint overloaded with excess weight will wear out faster.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But another factor is that ‘the current generation of people aged 40-65 are less tolerant of putting up with a painful knee,’ says Richard Spencer Jones, a knee replacement surgeon at The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital in Shropshire.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He is not suggesting that we should be more robust about pain, rather that he fears the fallout from people swapping their own rickety knee for a replacement too soon, as ‘some of these people will live well into their 90s and that knee is likely to need replacing a couple more times — [these will be] increasingly challenging procedures with more risks and potential complications’. In fact, 20 per cent of knee replacement patients are not happy with the result and 5 per cent feel worse off after, says Philip Mitchell, an orthopaedic surgeon at St George’s Hospital and the Fortius Clinic, both in London.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-fdb9bb20-69cd-11e8-9364-2ff2f19c7331">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">How to see the specialist you want </h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s a little-known fact, but under the NHS Constitution, patients in England have the right to choose where to receive their NHS treatment — which means you can ask to have your treatment in any hospital or clinic anywhere in the country, as long as it has the necessary expertise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your GP can arrange a referral to the specialist you would like to see. You (and your doctor) can access the electronic national referral service, called the NHS e-Referral Service, which allows you to select your hospital or clinic as well as the date and time of your first appointment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is not a guarantee that you will see a specific consultant — and there may be a waiting list for that specialist. You must also consider practical reasons for not travelling too far; if you need hospital treatment, you may not want to be hundreds of miles away from family and friends.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Note that many of the specialists in our guides work in private practice, too, so seeing them privately may also be an option.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Unfortunately, if you do an MRI of the painful knee of someone in their 60s, you will definitely find some arthritis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘What it won’t show is the degree of pain, or if replacing that knee will make it better. Yet armed with this MRI, the patient will almost certainly find a surgeon prepared to operate.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All orthopaedic surgeons tend to agree that the timing of a procedure is critical in achieving the best result for patients.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Operate too soon and patients with a stiff and occasionally painful knee are unlikely to be happy with the replacement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Delay too long and you risk making patients miserable, housebound and potentially suffering more muscle-wasting and deformity — resulting in more complicated surgery and a more challenging rehabilitation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are concerns that the increasingly long waits too many NHS patients face for surgery may have implications for this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the knee unit at The Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, surgeons will often first try using conservative measures with borderline patients before they undertake surgery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Think of this as a pre-emptive strike,’ says Professor Andrew Toms, an orthopaedic surgeon at the hospital. ‘Typically, this will be a mix of exercise, physiotherapy, weight loss and painkillers with the objective of trying to reduce patients’ pain and improve knee function sufficiently to avoid or stall knee replacement surgery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘If after going through this, patients don’t feel they have improved, then I will operate,’ says Professor Toms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Knee replacement falls into two main categories: partial knee replacement, where just one compartment of the arthritic knee is replaced; and total knee replacement, the choice for patients with widespread arthritis, where two or three compartments are replaced. The advantage of partial replacement is that it is a smaller operation which preserves the ligaments, so the chances are it will feel more like a normal knee; with total knee replacement one or both of the main (cruciate) ligaments are sacrificed. But one of the drawbacks is that surgeons who do few of them get worse results than with a total knee replacement (see box overleaf).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After surgery, patients have to brace themselves for hard work to regain full function in their new knee. But patients still struggling with pain six months or so later should have no qualms about returning to their consultant to be investigated, says Andrew Porteous, a knee surgeon at Southmead Hospital in Bristol.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘This could be caused by infection or because the knee was done badly — some surgeons try to fob patients off because they are worried a number of re-dos will flag a problem with the data they have to submit to the National Joint Registry [which publishes outcomes for every orthopaedic surgeon and hospital unit]. So they will do X-rays and say, “These don’t look too bad, off you go.”</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘In instances like that, the patient should go back to their GP and ask for a referral to a regional centre.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So how do you avoid the pitfalls and pinpoint the very best knee replacement surgeon? The best are high-volume surgeons, who do a large number of operations, and are expert in both partial and total replacements, so you get the full range of options. Patients can check their prospective surgeon’s profile on the National Joint Registry website to see how their surgeon’s caseload measures up against the average (see right).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To identify the country’s very best knee replacement surgeons, we canvassed the views of almost 40 leading consultants from around the country.

If a surgeon is doing fewer than 20 a year, that’s not a good sign and patients should think about going elsewhere. Most specialist knee replacement surgeons will be doing a least 150 a year.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How many knee ops do you have to re-do?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ask your surgeon about his or her revision rate (where a failed implant needs replacing). You can also check The National Joint Registry, which has information on over two million joint replacement operations in England, Wales and Northern Ireland since 2002. This includes more than 2,000 individual surgeons’ results and how they compare with the national average. It also provides data on the number of knee replacements, revisions and mortality rates by hospital. If yours has a higher-than-expected revision rate, ask why. Rather than a red flag, it could mean they’re specialists in salvaging knees when surgery has gone wrong (and such surgeons are very well-placed to avoid such mistakes themselves). See njrsurgeon hospitalprofile.org.uk and njrcentre.org.uk</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Should I try anything else before I go under the knife?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An artificial knee will never be as good as your own — most patients rate them about three-quarters as good, according to the charity Arthritis Research UK. Plus, surgery carries a risk of infection, bleeding and the implant failing, so if you don’t need it, you don’t want it. There are options to try before surgery, ask your surgeon if you are suitable. ‘If you wait too long, the knee gets stiffer and more deformed,’ says Professor Turner, ‘and results of surgery are worse if knees are really bad to start with.’ Steroid injections can ease inflammation and pain, while physiotherapy strengthens the thigh muscles that support the joint. Orthotics (insoles to correct knee alignment and gait) or an ‘off-loading’ knee brace (which applies pressure to the unaffected side of the knee) may have ‘some benefit’, he adds. But in most cases, these only delay surgery by six months to a year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Are there other surgery options for me?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Arthroscopy — keyhole surgery to clear debris in the knee — used to be common for osteoarthritis, but is now rapidly in decline as NICE has said it doesn’t help. A recent review of 25 studies in The BMJ concluded that the procedure offers no ‘important benefits’, as it neither reduces pain nor improves function and mobility, and carries risks of pain, swelling and difficulty putting weight on the leg. But osteotomy — where bone is added or removed from a damaged joint to shift the weight away from the damaged area — can ‘buy’ most patients ten or 15 years before having a knee replacement. Professor Adrian Wilson, a knee specialist at The Wellington Hospital in London, says osteotomy is the ‘operation of choice’ for people who want to stay active. ‘Wherever possible we advise joint preservation procedures such as osteotomy,’ he says. </p><img id="i-826a474a8f1440e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/22/4CFD0F0C00000578-5814197-image-a-18_1528320396506.jpg" height="829" width="586" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" />                            </div>                        </div><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Could you get away with just HALF a knee op? </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">During a knee replacement operation, the worn ends of the thigh and shin bones and any remaining cartilage are removed and replaced with titanium or cobalt-chrome components.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Almost all knee replacement operations — which take around an hour — are carried out through a 10 in incision down the front of the knee. Just 5 per cent of procedures are keyhole (through a 5 in incision).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, we guide you through the different types of implants on offer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>PARTIAL REPLACEMENT</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If arthritis affects only one side of the knee, it may be possible to have a partial knee replacement, where only the damaged bone is scraped out and replaced.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most partial replacements are mobile-bearing implants, which means the plastic insert replacing the cartilage is not fixed to the metal part of the implant attached to the shin. Mobile-bearing is said to wear better in partial knee replacements, but needs support from existing tissue, so isn’t suitable if you have ligament problems.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Because the operation is less invasive than total replacement, as less bone is removed, recovery is quicker and the knee functions better afterwards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It is not uncommon to be off your crutches at two weeks and walking normally by four to six, compared with a total knee replacement where you are off crutches by six to eight weeks,’ says Professor Adrian Wilson, a knee specialist at Winchester University and The Wellington Hospital in London.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A recent study in BMJ Open suggested that half of patients needing a knee replacement could be suitable for a partial replacement. The Oxford University study found that when partial replacements are carried out by surgeons who do lots of them, the outcomes are better than total knee replacements — and it’s cheaper for the NHS.</p><img id="i-b002eeafd0b86693" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/22/4CFD0F3500000578-5814197-image-a-19_1528320472968.jpg" height="634" width="634" alt="If arthritis affects only one side of the knee, it may be possible to have a partial knee replacement, where only the damaged bone is scraped out and replaced (stock image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, if the surgeon only does a small number of partial operations, the outcomes are worse than a total replacement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Researcher Professor David Murray said: ‘This is an important finding. If surgeons use partial knees in a quarter or more of knee replacements, this will improve results, save money and more patients will benefit.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Currently, partial replacements are only used for 20 per cent of patients — more commonly younger, slimmer, active ones — as for most patients the wear and tear in the knee is too advanced and the ligaments are not strong enough.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although movement can be better afterwards than with a total knee replacement, figures from the National Joint Registry suggest a partial replacement is also more likely to fail.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Around 10 per cent will need a second operation after ten years compared with less than 5 per cent with full replacement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>TOTAL REPLACEMENT</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is the most common type of knee replacement surgery, used in 75 per cent of cases. It involves replacing joint surfaces at the end of the thighbone and top of the shinbone and inserting a plastic spacer in between; this acts like cartilage, helping the joint move freely.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are several versions of this operation and 60 different prostheses can be used.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cemented OR uncemented? Most artificial knees are cemented into the ends of the thigh and shin bones for greater stability. If cement is not used, the surface of the implant facing the bone is coated to encourage bone to grow on to it, forming a natural bond.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Uncemented knees are more expensive, but the surgery is quicker, and some say it fits to the bone better. But there is little difference in results.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">FIXED VS MOBILE: Normally, the plastic spacer in an implant is fixed to the metal plate on the end of the shin (a fixed-bearing joint) but, with a mobile-bearing joint, the spacer can rotate within a certain range on the plate, so it can ‘find its own position of comfort’, says Howard Ware, a knee surgeon at Chase Farm Hospital in London. It’s thought this reduces wear and tear, but there’s no evidence yet it’s better than fixed bearing for total replacement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">LigamentS: Keep or sacrifice? Ligaments are bands of fibrous tissue that connect bones to each other. They are essential for keeping the joint stable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some knee implants retain the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) which runs from the back of the shin to the bottom of the thigh; others involve removing it (as the implant is differently shaped) to give the knee the equivalent stability.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the PCL is retained, it should make the knee feel more ‘normal’, but is only suitable for those with ligaments strong enough. Yet research shows keeping or removing the PCL makes little difference to the functioning of the knee.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kneecap: resurface it or not?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A total knee replacement may also involve replacing the under-surface of your kneecap with a smooth plastic dome.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Surgeons are split 50:50 on whether this should be done.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those in favour say it’s an opportunity to treat arthritis in the kneecap as well as the joint itself and reduce pain afterwards, so there’s a lower risk of further surgery. Those against argue that treating the arthritis in the main part of the knee is enough to treat the pain, and resurfacing the kneecap can cause problems of its own.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Persistent pain after a knee replacement can occur, and when it does it can be a significant problem,’ says Mark Wilkinson, a professor of orthopaedics at Sheffield University who operates at Claremont Hospital in Sheffield.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is thought to be caused by the way the nervous system works in some patients. ‘Anything to reduce that risk makes sense, so I always resurface the kneecap,’ he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-italic">GUIDE TO CONSULTANTS compiled by ANGELA BROOKS. </span></strong><strong><span class="mol-style-italic">Additional reporting by Rachel Ellis.</span></strong> </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-77b4f110-69c9-11e8-b5de-c58c727b2d2d">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Deluxe models may not be worth it </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">FEMALE IMPLANTS: Some artificial knee joints have been designed to more closely match the size and shape of an average woman’s knee.

I would say anything beyond 15 minutes would  be harmful.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHAT TYPE OF MILK SHOULD YOU USE </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for the types of milk, Dr Altchek recommends going with an option that is higher in fat content.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the glycemic index chart, which indicates how much a carbohydrate-containing food raises your blood-sugar levels, skim milk has a level of 32 while whole milk has a level of about 27.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Foods that are higher in glycemic index elevate hormones that increase the activity of oil glands in the skin, which could contribute to acne formation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">High glycemic foods also cause prematurely-aged collagen, which causes the skin to lose its elasticity and become more fragile.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the best milk option, according to Dr Altchek, is buttermilk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Buttermilk is laden in lactic acid, which helps a number of skin-related issues including sloughing off dead skin cells, lightening age spots and tightening skin. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Buttermilk has the highest lactic acid in it and will be more emollient to the skin,' Dr Altcheck said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He adds that animals, including pigs and dogs, are often bathed in buttermilk to soften and nourish their skin. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If it’s good enough for the pigs and dogs, it's good enough for us,' said Dr Altchek.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once the bath is done, Dr Altchek says to rinse off thoroughly - because milk decomposes quickly and you could end up smelling like rotten milk - and moisturize your skin. </p><img id="i-2368473b9e95206" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/18/4CFBD38700000578-5813021-Dr_Altcheck_recommends_choosing_buttermilk_for_a_milk_bath_becau-m-50_1528306676258.jpg" height="567" width="634" alt="Dr Altcheck recommends choosing buttermilk for a milk bath because it is high  in lactic acid, which helps a number of skin-related issues including sloughing off dead skin cells" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>OTHER BENEFITS FROM MILK  </strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Milk has more than just skin-nourishing benefits, it can also aid in easing suburns.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a previous interview with Daily Mail Online, Dr Joshua Zeichner said a cold milk compress shrinks the cells swollen from the burn and will drive heat away from the sore area.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'A milk compress can help calm inflamed skin as well, as proteins in the milk coat and soothe the skin,' he said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The lactic acid in milk will help peel away the inflamed, dead skin cells while vitamins A and D promote healing. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the compress, pour the milk in a bowl, soak a washcloth in the mixture and refrigerate until both are cold.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then lightly press the washcloth to your skin, applying even pressure all around the burned area.  </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>In a recent bizarre interview, singer Mariah Carey (left) revealed that she bathes in milk. While a bath in cold milk doesn't sound like the most relaxing activity - this is one instance where the diva offers sound advice. Milk actually contains healthy fats and proteins as well as  nourishing vitamins and minerals that help remove dead skin cells, prevent wrinkles and improve complexion. New York City dermatologist Dr Douglas Altcheck spoke to Daily Mail Online about how the properties in milk work to enrich skin, how long you should stay in the bath and even the type of milk that's best to use.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Mia DeGraaf</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-07T20:20:31.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>How bathing in milk like Mariah Carey can benefit your skin</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-07T20:20:31.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Mariah Carey</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5813093/Mother-two-60-felt-like-cheese-wire-inside-botched-vaginal-mesh-operation.html" title="Mother-of-two, 60, given vaginal mesh claims she can feel the controversial implant CUTTING her internal organs like a 'cheese wire' and admits the scandal-hit surgery left her suicidal"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5811903/B3-Vitamin-slow-effects-Parkinsons-restoring-power-cells-bodies.html" title="Hope for Parkinson's patients as scientists discover taking vitamin B3 can stop nerve cells from dying off in what could be a 'starting point' for treatment"></link></item><item><title>Did a woman REALLY become pregnant from eating squid?

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Accidental injury is one of the biggest single causes of death in the UK for children over the age of one - and kills more than leukaemia and meningitis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Every year, around 2 million children attend A&amp;E due to accidents. Around 76,000 of these require admission to hospital - the equivalent of 1,500 each week. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, in a piece for <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.hippocraticpost.com/paediatrics/how-safe-is-your-home/">The Hippocratic Post</a> for Child Safety Week, a first aid expert reveals that falls, burns, choking, suffocation, poisoning and drowning are the six most common childhood accidents. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Emma Hammett, founder of First Aid for Life, explains the simple safety precautions that all households can easily adopt to minimise the risk of children having accidents.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She argues that children should never be over-protected or wrapped in cotton wool because they need to take measured risks and the inevitable bumps and bruises are a healthy part of growing up. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, it is vitally important to have the knowledge to anticipate and prevent serious childhood injuries that can cause long-term damage and have life-changing consequences. </p><img id="i-c7f2d2e2321b5fbf" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/09/4CF7B7A500000578-5811529-Accidental_injury_is_one_of_the_greatest_causes_of_death_in_the_-a-1_1528274425239.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Accidental injury is one of the greatest causes of death in the UK for children over one" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Being one step ahead</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Children develop at different rates; they reach milestones at totally different times and some miss out stages altogether. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You will know your child well but may not anticipate at what point they will suddenly roll, become mobile or be able to reach new heights.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is exciting to see how quickly children grow, and to revel in new developments such as grabbing things, rolling over, crawling, standing, climbing, opening bottles and turning handles. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, it’s when these new abilities take us by surprise that serious childhood accidents can result.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When my children were younger, we had regular visits from older cousins and friends’ children. This gave us some insight into the next stages for our little ones. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Things of no interest to our children, or things way out of their reach, became a source of fascination for our visitors. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anticipating possible risks was incredibly useful as it meant we were always one step ahead in the battle to stay safe! </p><div>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">What are the hallmarks of a good doctor? Technical expertise and skill, of course — but someone who understands you, someone you trust, is also vital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, research shows that a good relationship with your doctor can actually improve the chances of a successful outcome. But how do you find a specialist who fits the bill?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That’s where this unique series of guides, running every day this week in the Mail, can help. We’ve identified the country’s top consultants — as judged by their peers. We’ve canvassed the views of more than 260 consultants across seven specialties from around the country and asked them this very simple, but key, question: If your own nearest and dearest were to need treatment in your field, to whom would you refer them — and why?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The consultants who earned the most votes from their peers are the ones who made it into our guides — though patients should bear in mind that this is not a scientific study.</p><img id="i-c174497ebaae6f9e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/17/4CF4989200000578-5810027-image-a-36_1528389506475.jpg" height="480" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, of course, there are many superb and highly skilled specialists all over the country who didn’t make it on to our list, but who spend every day of their working lives transforming patients’ lives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To help you make informed decisions about your care, we’ve also talked to experts about the latest thinking on treatment. Today, we focus on breast reconstructive surgery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">Why implants are more common</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-64505a60-6983-11e8-a9ad-a708fb59dc8a">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">HOW DO I SEE THE SPECIALIST I WANT? </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s a little known secret, but, under the NHS Constitution, patients in England have the right to choose where to receive their NHS treatment — which means you can ask to have your treatment in any hospital or clinic in the country if it has the necessary expertise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your GP can help arrange a referral to the specialist you would like to see. You (and your doctor) can access the electronic national referral service called the NHS e-Referral Service — this allows you to select your hospital or clinic as well as the date and time of your first appointment. This is not a guarantee that you will see a specific consultant — and there may be a waiting list for that specialist.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You must also consider other practical reasons for not travelling too far; if you need hospital treatment, you may not want to be hundreds of miles from family and friends.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Note that many of the specialists in our guides also work in private practice, so seeing them privately may also be an option.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just at the point when a woman can be at her most vulnerable, dealing with a breast cancer diagnosis, she is likely to be confronted by further bewildering choices on a matter to which she’s probably never given much thought: Would she like breast reconstruction?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some women may consider this a distraction; others see it as a step to aiding their self-confidence and recovery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Under National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, all breast cancer patients should be offered the full range of breast reconstruction procedures.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Broadly speaking, these fall into two main categories: implant-based reconstruction, or using the woman’s own surplus tissue, known as flaps, harvested from areas such as the abdomen, inner thigh or the back, to rebuild the breast.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Reconstruction can be carried out at the same time as the cancer surgery, or it can be delayed until all other treatment, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, is completed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although all options should be on the table for each woman, in practice it’s far less clear-cut.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most good surgeons will want to take the woman’s preferences into account, but a number of factors will influence which reconstruction option is best. The stage of cancer, the woman’s size and shape, where in the breast the lump is located and whether radiotherapy is necessary — this can scar and shrink tissues and interfere with blood supply to the breast, making reconstruction more difficult — these are all key factors in determining which type of reconstruction will produce the best cosmetic result, and whether it can be done immediately.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A woman with a smaller lump in the lower part of a medium to large, pendulous breast may be a good candidate for therapeutic mammoplasty — where the lump is removed with a cancer-free margin of tissue around it (i.e., a lumpectomy), allowing the surgeon to reshape the remaining tissue into a smaller breast.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a slim and smaller-breasted woman, breast conservation can be more of a challenge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘In a small breast, removing even a 1cm lump can leave a big defect,’ says Simon Smith, a breast surgeon at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford. ‘So then you have to think about whether you can move a bit of tissue from elsewhere to fill this, or consider whether that patient might be better with a mastectomy, then an implant reconstruction.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, 70 per cent of patients electing to have breast reconstruction end up with an implant. It is probably the simplest, most straightforward route and ‘it can get a lovely result’, according to Stephen McCulley, a breast surgeon at Nottingham City Hospital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, it is unlikely to age as well as a flap reconstruction, and if radiotherapy is needed, this may shrink the skin and harden the implant, in which case further surgery may be needed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With own-tissue breast reconstruction, the DIEP flap — where tissue and its blood supply is taken from the abdomen — is the gold-standard treatment. It is ideal for women with surplus fat around the abdomen, providing a soft, natural-feeling breast without any muscle-loss.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The key benefits of such microsurgical procedures — and only plastic surgeons are able to undertake these — is that they can provide a natural-looking and feeling breast which will gain and lose weight with the woman.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there are drawbacks — these are lengthy, complex operations and if some muscle has to be taken to boost blood supply in the breast, it can weaken areas where the tissue was mined.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Breast surgeons are the first port of call in the referral process. They diagnose suspicious lumps, carry out all necessary cancer surgery and also orchestrate chemotherapy and radiotherapy when it’s needed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Breast reconstruction is done by breast surgeons and plastic surgeons, sometimes called oncoplastic breast surgeons.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-b39eaf60-690e-11e8-a048-b7bd339fadd4">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">A tummy tuck can help with rebuilding your breast </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The aim of reconstruction is to restore a natural symmetry to a woman’s figure,’ says Steven Thrush, a breast surgeon at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘So if she’s having a mastectomy and has a generous breast, we might reconstruct a smaller breast and do a reduction on the other side.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, we look out the main available options.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>RECONSTRUCTION</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Partial: This can be an option when the cancer is on the outside of the breast and clearing it involves removing more than 15–20 per cent of the breast, but leaving more than 50 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tissue from elsewhere, such as the fatty pads in the armpits, is used to ‘fill in’ the missing parts — this is known as LICAP flap breast reconstruction.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">PROS: The healing process is quicker, though surgeons are limited by how much tissue is available, says Mr Thrush.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">CONS: There’s a risk that breast tissue that’s left behind contains cancer cells. And as more breast tissue is left with this technique, the risk may be increased, so patients tend to have radiotherapy afterwards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">FULL: This involves removing as much breast tissue as possible — the skin is retained, but the nipple may be removed if the cancer is close.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">THE DIEP FLAP: Here, fat, skin and blood vessels are lifted off the wall of the lower belly and are rejoined near the chest to rebuild the breast. This technique involves an automatic tummy tuck.</p><img id="i-809ac185f0f2dba" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/17/4CF497A100000578-5810027-image-a-34_1528389506443.jpg" height="537" width="586" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">PROS: ‘As this procedure uses fat from the patient’s body, the reconstruction feels and moves like breast tissue,’ says Mr Thrush. ‘It’s warm, changes in shape and ages with the woman’s body.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘If you lose or put on weight, the flap does, too. This is considered the gold standard in breast reconstruction.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">CONS: It’s not suitable if you have a flat tummy. Also, the operation lasts six or seven hours, patients need to be in hospital for six days and it can take three months to recover fully, says Mr Thrush, and some women may not want a long recovery time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Due to its complexity, only some hospitals offer the procedure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The biggest problem is that, because it’s such complex surgery, it doesn’t always work — one in 40 fails,’ adds Mr Thrush. ‘This is devastating for the patient, who’s gone through all that surgery for nothing.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">THE LATISSIMUS DORSI FLAP: The latissimus dorsi is a muscle in the back, just below the shoulder and behind the armpit. We need it for twisting movements, such as opening a door.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, the muscle, along with skin and fat, is moved to the chest to build a new breast. It remains attached to the arm for its blood supply.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">PROS: Unlike the DIEP flap, the blood vessels don’t have to be rejoined, so it’s less complex surgery, explains Mr Thrush.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The operation takes three to four hours, patients stay in a hospital for a few days and recovery time is usually six weeks, quicker than with the DIEP.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">CONS: There’s less fat on the back to create the breast, which can affect the shape. And as the new breast is made with muscle, it can behave like one. ‘So doing movements that affect the muscle can cause the breast to twitch,’ says Mr Thrush.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also, that side of the body might not be as strong as before.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>BREAST IMPLANTS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Implant surgery involves using a silicone gel or a saline-filled silicone shell.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">PROS: It causes very little scarring and is a much simpler operation than flap options.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The implants are anatomically shaped [they mimic breast shape] or are round,’ says Ruth Waters, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and BMI The Priory Hospital in Birmingham.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most surgeons usually use textured implants, which allow tissue to ‘stick’ to them, so they’re less likely to move or rotate. Smooth implants, which move freely inside the breast capsule, may create a rippling effect.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">CONS: The breasts can feel colder or less mobile.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The body can form hardened tissue around the implant [capsular contracture], which makes the breast uncomfortable and distorts its shape,’ says Ms Waters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Implants need to be replaced after ten to 20 years. They can change in size and sometimes rupture without symptoms, so surgeons should recommend regular MRIs.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Oncoplastics is effectively a hybrid of oncology (cancer care) and some types of plastic surgery; oncoplastic breast surgeons are experts in clearing cancer and can undertake implant reconstructions and breast conservation surgery, with the aim of creating the sort of cosmetic result the patient can live with.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, it’s worth noting that the term ‘oncoplastic’ commonly tagged on to the title ‘breast surgeon’ does not necessarily signify any further qualification — many breast surgeons who have adopted the term have had no formal training in oncoplastics, although the majority may well have done courses or visited hospitals to learn from experienced surgeons and have become very good in the process.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Plastic and reconstructive surgeons are qualified to carry out the most complex microsurgical breast reconstructions, but not to remove the cancer, for example with a lumpectomy or mastectomy (although some now do extensive further training for this, too).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In large breast units, oncoplastic breast surgeons work with the plastic surgeons as a team; breast surgeons in smaller hospitals, which are unlikely to have an on-site plastic surgeon, may well refer patients suitable for flap reconstructions to larger regional units providing such services.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘This in itself is a quality indicator, the sign of a hospital wanting to provide the full spectrum of reconstructions for their patients,’ says Mr McCulley.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what are the hallmarks of the best breast and plastic surgeons? ‘Cancer clearance is absolutely the number-one priority,’ says Jo Skillman, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at University Hospital in Coventry.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It has to be safe — but it is a fine balance. We have to take enough tissue, but not overdo it. If we don’t take enough, we can compromise cancer clearance. If we take too much, we compromise the aesthetic result.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To identify the country’s very best consultants in breast reconstruction, we canvassed the views of around 40 breast and plastic surgeons themselves.

Sometimes this may be down to cost — this type of surgery can cost up to £20,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Ruth Waters, a consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon who specialises in breast surgery at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, every woman diagnosed with breast cancer should be offered all the options. ‘Obviously some types of reconstructive surgery are better for certain patients.

Depending on the aggressiveness of the cancer, ‘this can be very successful,’ says Geraldine Mitchell, a breast surgeon at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Between 33 and 46 per cent of patients will respond to this to the extent that under the microscope we can no longer spot any cancer cells.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘That doesn’t mean there will be no surgery — because there could be tiny satellite cancer cells remaining — but it does mean we can save those patients from a disfiguring operation or mastectomy.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This may mean the patient may need a less extensive reconstruction operation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The order of chemotherapy and surgery very much depends on the type of breast cancer being treated,’ explains Lester Barr, a breast cancer surgeon at the Genesis Breast Cancer Prevention Centre at Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘So for example with HER2-positive breast cancer [which tests positive for a protein that promotes the growth of cancer] we like to give chemotherapy first, as it shrinks the tumour and makes the surgery easier.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘And also the chemotherapy is the priority — we have drugs such as Herceptin which work effectively in treating this cancer because they specifically target the HER2 molecule.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘So we like to get the chemotherapy in early.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With triple negative breast cancer, chemotherapy is also suggested before any surgery, he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But with women with certain types of oestrogen receptor positive breast cancers, it’s more usual to wait until after the surgery to decide if chemotherapy is needed, explains Dr Sacha Howell, a consultant in medical oncology at the Christie and Wythenshawe Hospitals in Manchester.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It’s important to look at the biology of the tumour. If it’s a small tumour, less than 2 cm in size, chemotherapy may not be needed unless it is an especially aggressive cancer or if it has spread to the lymph nodes.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If chemotherapy does take place first, it can take up to a couple of months after treatment has finished for a woman to be well enough to go ahead with surgery, adds Mr Barr.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘By then haemoglobin levels — needed for red blood cells — will have recovered and white cells, needed to fight infection, are functioning well.’ Of course, the order of treatment is ultimately the patient’s decision — some will want to have reconstruction first to get all their surgery ‘out of the way’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It’s important to remember that if you do a simultaneous immediate reconstruction as part of a mastectomy operation there’s a chance chemotherapy will be delayed because you are making a recovery from quite a big operation,’ says Mr Barr.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It’s one of the reasons, if chemotherapy is strongly advised, to have it first.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the chemotherapy is to be given after the surgery, the timing depends on the procedure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Recovery of about four weeks is needed after a mastectomy before chemotherapy can begin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The same is true if the operation also includes implant surgery. For more extensive reconstructive surgery using the patient’s own tissue, recovery before chemotherapy can take between four to ten weeks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">IF YOU’RE HAVING RADIOTHERAPY . . .</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If radiotherapy is needed, different factors have to be taken into account for reconstructive surgery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The treatment can mean the surrounding tissue on the breast won’t heal well, says Dr Howell. ‘If you have had radiotherapy prior to reconstruction, it limits the wound healing ability.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Reconstruction is possible before radiotherapy, but the treatment may spoil the cosmetic outcome, as radiotherapy can change the shape or size of the reconstructed breast, explains Mr Barr. (See reconstruction options, on the previous page.)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The job of the team is to calculate the risk of local recurrence and long-term survival when deciding treatment options,’ adds Dr Howell.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘This should be discussed very early after diagnosis. It’s vital patients know all the facts and understand the issues and options op</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">How to ensure your bra fits comfortably after surgery</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Adapting to changes after reconstruction surgery also means choosing the right bra, explains Dr Anne Rigg, a consultant medical oncologist specialising in breast cancer at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals in London.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It can take some time, even up to a year, to recover.

Avoid underwired designs as these can be uncomfortable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Opt for styles with a wide band under the cups and round the back as well as full cups.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The bra should provide cup separation, so that the centre of the bra between the cups lies flat on the chest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘For women who have had a mastectomy without reconstruction, it is possible to buy bras with a bra pocket in which to hold breast prosthesis. These bras should be well fitted with full cup to secure the prosthesis,’ says Dr Rigg.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It’s also possible to buy pockets to sew in yourself, though avoid sewing in too tightly. Remember that shape and size can change during and/or after treatment, so it’s a good idea to have your bra size accurately measured before you buy any new ones.’<span class="mol-style-italic"> </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic"><strong>GUIDE TO CONSULTANTS compiled by ANGELA BROOKS.

Unfortunately, up to half-a-million go undiagnosed and, as their condition hasn’t been spotted and, therefore, treated, their risk of stroke is significantly raised.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The good news for those who have been diagnosed is that there’s been a revolution in the treatment of heart rhythm disorders in recent years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These disorders occur when the heart’s electrical circuits, responsible for keeping it pumping, become scrambled, sending faulty messages that override the heart’s natural pacemaker, a cluster of cells known as the sinus node. This problem can be something you were born with or a consequence of coronary heart disease or ageing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Arrhythmias can range from a slow heartbeat, where the organ can’t pump enough blood around the body, to the most dangerous form, ventricular fibrillation —the latter can be fatal without rapid emergency treatment.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Symptoms range from the mild to the alarming. Your heart may seem to flutter or skip beats. Or it can race like mad, even though you’re just quietly watching TV. Or you might find yourself suddenly exhausted, short of breath and prone to fainting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The most common arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation, which causes a fast, chaotic heartbeat. This tends to occur mostly in people over the age of 60 and affects around a million Britons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, random electrical charges cause the upper chambers of the heart (called the atria) to quiver, affecting the heart’s ability to pump blood efficiently.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The most serious consequence of untreated atrial fibrillation is stroke, because the heart’s feeble pumping action allows blood to pool, causing clots, which can break off and travel to the brain. This is why one of the first steps in treating the condition is blood-thinning medication.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whatever the type of arrhythmia, medication can be used to try to control or prevent it.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-7cb7c6c0-68dd-11e8-bf92-f723a1384c47">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">WHAT IS ARRHYTHMIA? </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">More than two million people in the UK have a faulty heartbeat, or arrhythmia.

This non-surgical procedure is becoming the gold standard way to resolve problems with heart rhythm, particularly atrial fibrillation, says Philippa Hobson, a senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is performed by an expert cardiologist, known as an electrophysiologist, and takes between two and four hours. A thin wire with an electrode at its tip is threaded through the veins — usually starting in the thigh — to the heart to create scar tissue, either with heat or freezing, to destroy rogue tissue responsible for sending faulty signals, or effectively block abnormal electrical circuits in the heart.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, as one leading cardiologist told us, it would be a dreadful shame ‘if the technological demands eclipsed the human side’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Edward Rowland, who is based at St Bartholomew’s Hospital in London, says that empathy and a caring attitude are important, too — particularly when patients are worried.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Successfully treating patients, he suggests, is not just about the ablation operation, but how the patient is treated in the run-up to it and their aftercare.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘When your heart starts going crazy and you think you are going to die, it is not surprising that patients can become very anxious,’ says Dr Rowland.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Technical expertise is very important — but this has to be accompanied by other human factors to produce the best results possible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There are some cardiologists who are excellent technically, but you would not necessarily send your closest family to them.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, how do you find an electrophysiologist equipped with not just the technological nous, but also the bedside manner that can help people conquer a distressing, and sometimes disabling, disease?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We asked 40 consultants across the country who they believe are the top performers.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">What are the hallmarks of a good doctor? Technical expertise and skill, of course — but someone who understands you, someone you trust, is also vital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, research shows that a good relationship with your doctor can actually improve the chances of a successful outcome.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But how do you find a specialist who fits the bill? That’s where this unique series of guides, running every day this week in the Mail, can help.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’ve identified the country’s top consultants — as judged by their peers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’ve canvassed the views of more than 260 consultants across seven specialties from around the country, and asked them this very simple but key question: ‘If your own nearest and dearest were to need treatment in your field, to whom would you refer them — and why.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The consultants who earned the most votes from their own peers are the ones who made it into our guides. Though patients should bear in mind that this is not a scientific study and there are many superb and highly skilled specialists all over the country who didn’t make it onto our list but who spend every day of their working lives making a real difference to patients.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To help you make informed decisions about your care, we’ve also talked to experts about the latest thinking on treatment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, we look at the best prostate cancer surgeons.</p><img id="i-1f52e7591cdbdf06" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/17/4CF14EDB00000578-0-image-a-1_1528216917176.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The good doctors guide: Meet the best urologists in Britain and learn the pioneering treatments used in the battle against prostate cancer" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ask most people how prostate cancer is treated and the chances are they’ll say ‘surgery’. In fact, surgery — removal of the prostate — is just one weapon in the arsenal of procedures.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone treatment have as big a part to play for many patients and, increasingly, urologists advocate ‘active surveillance’, where patients are regularly monitored to keep tabs on the tumour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This means they can avoid unnecessary treatment, but it gives them the option to decide on surgery in the event the tumour changes. Active surveillance is earmarked for patients with low-risk cancer which hasn’t spread beyond the prostate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘In the past, we’ve tended to couple cancer diagnosis with treatment,’ says Anthony Koupparis, a urological surgeon at Southmead Hospital in Bristol.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘What we are now doing is disconnecting that process so, at the point of diagnosis, we put the brakes on and have a discussion with the patient and explain the type of cancer they have. If it’s not life threatening, I will tell the patient they genuinely don’t need an operation.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Every now and then I will get a man who, despite the very early low-grade nature of their cancer, cannot deal with the thought of living with it,’ adds Mr Koupparis. ‘I will give him lots to read on the subject and if he returns and says he can’t deal with living with an untreated tumour, then I will definitely operate, if that’s what he wants.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avoiding needless treatment is driven by the fact that surgery to remove the prostate (radical prostatectomy) and radio-therapy can leave men incontinent and impotent as a result of damage to muscles and nerves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Around 15 per cent of prostate cancer patients have surgery. Up to a quarter will suffer temporary urinary leakage afterwards, although only two out of 100 men have major problems with urinary incontinence one year after surgery, according to Cancer Research UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Erectile dysfunction can also be a problem. It is ‘realistic’ to expect some problems with erectile dysfunction after surgery, according to Jane Brocksom, a senior nurse specialist in urology and Vice President of the British Association of Urological Nurses. But ‘most men will have only mild issues’ and sexual function can return.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, it’s important to note that many men may have had such problems before diagnosis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘A lot of prostate patients say that their waterworks and erections are fine, but when we check the questionnaires we ask them to complete, you can see those functions aren’t normal,’ says Mr Koupparis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The risk can be reduced with a technique known as nerve-sparing prostatectomy (which may be possible when the cancer is low grade and hasn’t spread beyond the prostate).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Around six out of ten men will be able immediately to have an erection if the surgeon is able to spare the nerves during surgery, says Cancer Research UK. The technique involves protecting the nerves by peeling them away before removing the prostate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The prostate is removed with a small rim of surrounding tissue and sent to a pathology lab where it is examined under a microscope to see how close to the margins of the gland the cancer has spread.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Surgeons want a cancer-free margin of tissue around the prostate to be certain no cancer cells have been left behind.</p><mol-permabox id="mol-ba77cfd0-68df-11e8-bf70-93c99a3e706e"></mol-permabox><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, labs take three days to process the result, so in borderline cases — men with larger and more aggressive tumours which might pose a threat to the nerves — the surgeon makes a judgment based on what he can see and scans and tests carried out beforehand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Does he take a belt and braces approach, and sacrifice the nerves to be sure the cancer is controlled? Or should he spare them to optimise potency?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A new form of nerve-sparing surgery shows promise in helping men preserve their erections without compromising their long-term health.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">NeuroSAFE speeds up the pathology process so that conclusive results are given to the surgeon while the patient is still on the operating table. A study at the NHS Lister Hospital in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, where NeuroSAFE is now routinely offered to all patients who stand to benefit, 74 per cent of men who were able to have erections before surgery were still able to a year after, compared with 45 per cent of men not assessed with it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the real seismic shift in prostate cancer treatment has been the arrival of the Da Vinci robot — where a surgeon remotely controls three or four robotic arms over the patient lying a few feet away. Robot-assisted prostatectomies now constitute 80 per cent of all prostate removal procedures in the UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The £1.5 million cost of a robot has led to prostate cancer treatment shifting to major centres in cities such as London, Bristol, Newcastle and Canterbury. This in turn has reduced complication rates and improved outcomes for patients, because the number of prostatectomies each surgeon performs has soared.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As Declan Cahill, a urological surgeon at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, explains: ‘The link between high volume [large number of operations performed per year] and good outcomes is undisputed.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Professor Chris Eden, a urological surgeon at the Royal Surrey County Hospital, says he wouldn’t ‘send my own relative to anyone doing fewer than 100 prostatectomies a year — that’s what you need to maintain consistently good results. That may seem unfair to urologists doing fewer, but surgeons have no God-given right to do an operation.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can check how many prostatectomies each surgeon carries out on the British Association of Urological Surgeons website (baus.org.uk — search under Patients).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Surgeons are also required to submit some of their results on the website. Good urologists will record not just their mortality and complication data but also the ‘functional outcomes’ — in other words, results for continence and erectile function.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In any event, prospective patients should certainly ask a urologist about their results — and be cautious about anyone who is less than forthcoming.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what are the other hallmarks of a good urologist? We set out to identify not just those consultants who get consistently good results but those judged to be outstanding by their peers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We canvassed the views of around 40 urologists from around the country on who are the top performers — here we reveal their choices, with a selection of the personal comments about why they chose them.</p><p

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Carbs have been my downfall — I love eating them so much that my 6ft frame once ballooned to 19st as a result (egg fried rice and custard tarts, if you must know). I dropped that to 13st through dieting, but still constantly have to watch my weight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In making my new <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/bbc/index.html" id="mol-5b229250-6843-11e8-9d95-43ff4b3e4088">BBC</a> television programme, The Truth About Carbs, I went on a mission, talking to leading experts to find out how to be clever with carbs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So much dieting nowadays is all-or-nothing. People often try to banish all carbs from their diets. As I know from personal experience, this can just make people miserable — and is therefore almost impossible to sustain.</p><img id="i-d8eda58af923d77" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/22/4CE978F800000578-5805491-image-a-3_1528148427999.jpg" height="599" width="634" alt="Test: The cracker test is a quick and easy way to see how many carbs you should be eating" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But as I’ve now learned, not all carbohydrates are created equal. Some are very good for us, though many are indeed bad, causing us to pile on weight, raise our risk of diabetes and even threatening our fertility.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Learning to eat carbs more intelligently has helped me control my weight more easily. As a medical doctor with a degree in public health, I’m convinced it could bring similar benefits to millions of Britons. Here’s how to live happily on good carbs — and avoid the worst.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>TEST THAT REVEALS IF CARBS MAKES YOU FAT </strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A lucky few can eat carb-heavy foods without piling on fat — because our bodies can process them very efficiently.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many of us aren’t so fortunate. The cracker test is a quick and easy way to see how many carbs you should be eating.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Simply chew on a plain cracker until it changes in flavour from a bland biscuit to quite sweet. If the taste changes in less than 30 seconds, your body probably processes carbs quite effectively.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But if the cracker hasn’t changed taste after 30 seconds, then you should seriously consider eating a lower carb diet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Sharon Moalem, the Canadian geneticist who created this test, says a very slow (or no) taste change shows that your body doesn’t process carbs efficiently. This leads to perilous weight gain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The physiological mechanisms behind this test have not been nailed down completely — it’s probably genetic, reflecting levels of amylase, an enzyme in saliva, which breaks starch down into sugar for the body to use for energy. Some people have saliva that’s loaded with amylase (up to 50 times more than others) and break down carbs more readily, hence the sugary taste.</p><img id="i-3d4d2bb5ed66023b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/22/4CBD918700000578-5805491-image-a-11_1528148524242.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="How does your body react? But if the cracker hasn’t changed taste after 30 seconds, then you should seriously consider eating a lower carb diet" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you notice the sweetness within 0 to 14 seconds, your body processes carbs efficiently for use as energy — you can have 250g of carbs a day (roughly four slices of wholewheat bread).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If it takes 15 to 30 seconds, you can have 175g of carbs a day (around three-and-a-half slices of wholewheat bread).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More than 30 seconds, you’re not a great processor of carbs so the body is less able to use the excess as energy, and so stores it as fat. So you can have just 125g of carbs a day (around three slices of wholewheat bread).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When I did the test, it took me 34 seconds to taste the sweetness — unsurprisingly, given my history of weight gain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>CUT BACK ON BEIGE AND WHITE CARBS </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Beige’ carbs and ‘white’ carbs are the bad carbs and we eat far too much of them. Beige carbs are those in foods with lots of starch, such as potatoes, pasta, rice and white bread.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">White carbs are found in sugary foods such as fizzy drinks, sweets and processed and refined foods including cakes and biscuits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The problem is that most of the starch and sugar in bad carbs are broken down into glucose for energy. If you eat too much, the glucose is stored as fat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there are some carbs we’re not getting enough of — ‘green’ carbs. These are the dietary fibre found in fruit and veg, which releases energy very slowly. It’s good for our gut and doesn’t tend to make us fat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>GOOD CARBS HELP PREVENT CANCER </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most starchy carbohydrates — such as potatoes and white bread — are easily and quickly digested. But about 5 per cent of it is far less digestible: it gets right through the stomach to the bowel. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We call this ‘resistant starch’. This type of carbohydrate is particularly bountiful in high-fibre foods such as lentils, beans and unprocessed whole grains.</p><img id="i-34c52b9230046129" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/22/4CC2F5F500000578-5805491-image-a-1_1528148375577.jpg" height="634" width="634" alt="Slice of life: Scientists have discovered that cooking and cooling turns some of the beige and white carbs into resistant starches" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Resistant starch feeds the growth of beneficial bacteria in the bowel. These bacteria in turn produce chemicals that prevent diseases such as cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This explains why eating the recommended 30g a day of dietary fibre can reduce your chances of bowel cancer by 30 per cent.What’s more, these resistant starches have another key benefit — our bodies take only around half the calories from them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="health-ccox">RE-HEAT PASTA TO MAKE IT 'GOOD'</span> </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can turn ‘bad carbs’ into good ones. Scientists have discovered that cooking and cooling turns some of the beige and white carbs into resistant starches. The effect works best if you reheat carby foods such as pasta, rice and potatoes (make sure everything, especially rice, is piping hot).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What happens is that when the food is cooked and then cools down, fats and oils in the surrounding food attach themselves to the starch molecules, which makes them harder to digest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So when you pop last night’s lasagne into the microwave the following day, you’re doing your health a favour. Yes, it is all right to eat bread!</p><img id="i-48f7688a759eec91" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/22/152F3B38000005DC-5805491-image-m-14_1528149591332.jpg" height="875" width="634" alt="Food for thought: Dr Xand van Tulleken (right) with his doctor brother, Christopher" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But you should switch from mass-produced breads to rye bread or stoneground wholemeal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These are still deliciously bready but are much better for your weight and gut health — and keep you feeling fuller for longer. Sixty per cent of the bread we eat is white. It’s full of starch that turns into fat-producing glucose before it reaches your bowel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, stoneground wholegrain and rye breads contain the fibrous resistant starch that our bodies struggle to break down into glucose, and which instead feeds our gut bacteria.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But check the sugar content on the packaging of wholemeal breads because some large brands add sugar to counteract the bitterness of the whole grain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>EAT WHITE BREAD FROM THE FREEZER </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many of us maintain that only white bread will do when it comes to toast. If you must have it, there is a way of making it a little healthier (though it’s still not as good as wholemeal or rye). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And that’s to freeze your white bread first. Then stick it in the toaster straight from the freezer. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Freezing turns ordinary starch carbs into resistant starch, so your body gets far fewer calories from the bread. In effect, the resistant starch feeds your gut bacteria not you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>SPIT-OUT THOSE SPORTS DRINKS </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Carb-laden sports drinks claim to give you extra energy to exercise, but do you need them?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the TV programme, I completed two gruelling half-hour time trials on an exercise bike. Each time I swilled my mouth with water or sugared water. But I didn’t swallow any of it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just rinsing my mouth with sugared water enabled me to cycle 600m more than with water alone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That’s a massive difference. And it comes down to a brain trick. Sugary sports drinks prompt receptors in your mouth to tell your brain to expect a burst of carbs. Your brain then tells your body it’s OK to expend more energy, because fresh sugary carbs are on their way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But you don’t have to swallow the liquid to get this effect. And just a solution of sugar in water will do just fine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>HOW CARBS CAN HURT FERTILITY </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Recent research shows that overconsumption of refined ‘bad’ carbs can lead to fertility problems. We’re still in the process of discovering precisely how these mechanisms work, but Grace Dugdale, a reproductive biologist and researcher at the Leeds Centre for Reproductive Medicine, told me that if you eat lots of refined carbs, they rapidly convert into blood sugar and create spikes of energy that damage the mitochondria — the batteries that provide power for the cells in eggs and sperm, which are really important for their quality.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Grace is using a low-carb diet to help couples become fertile.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>SMALL STEPS FOR A BIG DIFFERENCE </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eating carbs more intelligently involves making small dietary adjustments. This may mean, for example, eating cauliflower (green carb) cheese rather than macaroni (beige) cheese.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A few of the bigger changes I’ve made include:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">- Making a big pot of porridge that I reheat in batches so it’s full of resistant starch;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">- Eating much more celariac than I ever did — it’s a great substitute for roasties</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">- Buying my bread from a baker and getting them to slice it — making one trip per month — and then freezing it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">- Swapping good carbs for bad not only slims you down but improves your blood-sugar levels, crucial for beating diabetes — without making you hungry or miserable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">The Truth About Carbs, BBC1, 8pm, tomorrow.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Learning to eat carbs more intelligently has helped Dr Xand Van Tulleken control his weight more easily.

In turn, the two parts of the valve that need to meet in order for it to close, known as leaflets, cannot do so.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This causes blood to ‘leak’ – flow back the wrong way – meaning that the damaged heart has to work harder to pump blood in the right direction.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A leaky valve also means that blood doesn’t move around the rest of the body efficiently, causing severe breathlessness, water retention and fatigue.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It can be very debilitating,’ says Dr Michael Mullen, consultant interventional cardiologist at Barts Health NHS Trust in London. ‘Some patients struggle to walk more than 50 yards because they become so breathless and can become virtually housebound.’</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Traditionally, treatment has involved open-heart surgery to make the leaflets in the mitral valve meet again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, says Dr Mullen: ‘Many patients with leaking valves – most of whom have already had a heart attack – simply aren’t fit enough for it. They rely on medication alone, which is often not enough to control their symptoms.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, a new procedure, performed for first time in the UK at St Bartholomew’s Hospital in London, is giving hope to those deemed too high-risk for surgery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rather than the patient being opened up, the leaky valve can be repaired via a 1cm incision made in the groin and by inserting a bracelet-like device called a cardioband.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Mullen, who performs the procedure with his colleague Dr Simon Kennon, says: ‘This is the nearest we have got to emulating open-heart surgery, which is the most successful technique.’</p><img id="i-fccb4c6b17b65762" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/20/0D0BE73D00000514-0-image-a-50_1527967101026.jpg" height="424" width="634" alt="Now, a new procedure, performed for first time in the UK at St Bartholomew¿s Hospital in London, is giving hope to those deemed too high-risk for surgery.

The cardioband – a 10cm-long wire covered in cloth – is passed up to the heart through the tube. Using ultrasound and X-ray guidance, doctors attach the band to the base of the heart valve with up to 17 tiny screws.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The band is then tightened by reeling in the wire that connects the screws to form the valve into a C-shape, rather like pulling the drawstrings on a teabag.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This corrects the enlarged opening of the valve allowing the leaflets to meet properly and reduce the leakage. ‘Most patients will only need a one-night stay in hospital and should feel better almost immediately,’ says Dr Mullen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Richard Pepper, 70, a retired database administrator from Chelmsford, was the first patient in the UK to have the new procedure. He said: ‘I was always breathless and spent most of my time sitting down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Despite having the procedure only at the end of March, I’m already so much better.

The new technique could treat some of the half-million Britons who have problem with a heart valve – the part that ensures blood is pumped round the body in the right direction. The new technique tackles a problem called a ‘leaky’ valve, which affects the mitral valve on the left of the heart.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Rod Ardehali</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-02T22:36:16.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Pioneering keyhole procedure that seals leaking heart valves</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-02T22:36:16.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5798717/Men-untreatable-prostate-cancer-halt-spread-live-longer.html" title="'Lazarus' drug pulling men with lethal prostate cancer back from the brink through pioneering immunotherapy treatment"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5791543/More-women-choosing-breasts-removed-avoid-cancer.html" title="'Angelina Jolie' effect sees number of women choosing to have their breasts removed to reduce their risk of cancer DOUBLE – and women in their 20s are now having the procedure"></link></item><item><title>Kia is finally home: Toddler who has lost all four limbs after being struck by the worst case of meningitis in 25 years is cradled by her parents after leaving hospital for the first time since September</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5794417/Heartwarming-pictures-baby-struck-worst-meningitis-case-allowed-home.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 08:36:04 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5794417</guid><description><![CDATA[Kia Gott, from Wyke, West Yorkshire, refused to give up her fight and yesterday Kia was allowed home for the first time on a day-release basis from Bradford Royal Infirmary.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Wireless carriers are constructing cell towers a stronger, faster 5G network, but some experts warn that the updated service's health effects are unknown and potentially dangerous.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today, there are 154,000 cell towers in the US, according to wireless communication association, CTIA. By 2026, it estimates another 800,000 will be needed to support 5G. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The network update will bring more Americans into closer proximity with milimeter waves, very short-wave radiation. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Research on cell phone radiation has yielded mixed findings, but some studies have linked older wireless service generations to cancers of the heart and reproductive organs, and 5G's health effects have hardly been studied. </p><img id="i-18cd67f920d4a2df" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/23/4CBD38B800000578-5784487-image-a-21_1527631519860.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Wireless providers have begun installing 800,000 'small cell' towers to support the roll out of the new 5G cellular network, but some public health experts warn they may endanger humans" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new network is slated to support at 100 billion devices, connecting to the internet at anywhere between 10 and 100 times the speeds that information travels through the 4G network. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In order to facilitate these speeds, the new network communicates through millimeter waves (MMWs) rather than microwaves, as previous generations have. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The microwave networks are nearly saturated, hence the switch to the virtually untouched, lower frequency MMWs for 5G. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But smaller waves cannot travel as far, or through as many types of materials. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This means that there will need to be far more individual 'small cell towers' closer together - some have suggested they will be on every street corner in the US.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 5G technology is too new to have been thoroughly tested and studied by many parties outside of cell service providers. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Dr Joel Moskowitz, a public health professor at the University of California, Berkeley, MMWs could pose a very real danger. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The deployment of 5G, or fifth generation cellular technology, constitutes a massive experiment on the health of all species,' he told Daily Mail Online. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> Because MMWs are weaker than microwaves, they are predominantly absorbed by the skin, meaning their distribution is quite focused there,  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Since skin contains capillaries and nerve endings, MMW bio-effects may be transmitted through molecular mechanisms by the skin or through the nervous system,' Dr Moskowitz writes on his blog.     </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also told Daily Mail Online that he's concerned that '5G will use high-band frequencies, or millimeter waves, that may affect the eyes, the testes, the skin, the peripheral nervous system, and sweat glands.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Millimeter waves can also make some pathogens resistant to antibiotics,' he added. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Moskowitz is not alone in aprehensions. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The International Society of Doctors for the Environment, its subsidiaries in 27 countries and more than 200 doctors and scientists are all calling for a stop to be put to the roll out of 5G, 'due to concern that 5G radio frequency radiation will have adverse health effects,' Dr Moskowitz says. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So far, their warnings have gone unheeded.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Verizon began rolling out their 5G small cell towers in 11 cities 2017, and AT&amp;T started installing the new generation of service in Waco and Dallas, Texas, as well as in Atlanta, Georgia this year. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Wireless service providers are rolling out 800,000 cell towers to support the new 5G network, but a University of California, Berkeley public health expert warns the radiation may be dangerous.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Natalie Rahhal</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-05-30T00:21:53.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>The rollout of 5G is 'a massive health experiment,' expert warns</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-05-30T00:21:53.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5757461/Humans-causing-cancer-ANIMALS-surge-plastic-waste-light-pollution-pesticides.html" title="Humans are causing cancer in ANIMALS with a surge in plastic waste, dirty oceans, pesticides and even STREET LAMPS "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5742405/Hawaiis-new-ban-sunscreens-kill-coral-outlawed-effective-sunscreens.html" title="Hawaii¿s new ban on sunscreens that kill coral has outlawed the most effective sunscreens for preventing skin cancer, experts warn "></link></item><item><title>A mix of Viagra and the flu vaccine could treat cancer: Bizarre cocktail is now being tested in humans after reducing the disease by 90% in mice</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5746609/A-mix-Viagra-flu-vaccine-treat-cancer.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 May 2018 21:34:39 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5746609</guid><description><![CDATA[The team at the University of Ottawa found that erectile dysfunction drugs block suppressor cells, allowing natural killer cells to do their cancer-fighting job.

But recent scientific research questions this, showing that some fats – such as omega-3 found in oily fish – can reduce blood pressure and the risk of blood clots, and boost brain health. A 2014 study, conducted by researchers at Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard universities, examined more than 80 studies on the subject, involving almost half a million people, and concluded there was no convincing evidence that eating saturated fats leads to a greater risk of heart disease.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, eating a particular type of saturated fat (found in dairy products) can reduce heart-disease risk, and full-fat dairy eaters often have a lower body mass index (BMI) than low-fat converts. Full-fat yogurt containing live bacteria (check the labels) such as bifidio bacteria and lactobacillus will help contribute to a healthy microbiome (the bacteria in the gut). This sort of research inspired me to reintroduce butter and full-fat Greek yogurt into my diet. Avoid highly processed fats in cakes, biscuits and margarines, but healthy fats such as fish, dairy, olive oil and nuts will help to keep you healthy and trim.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHY 800 CALORIES ON FAST DAYS, NOT 600 OR 1,000?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When I wrote The Fast Diet in 2012, I advised that on ‘fast days’, men should eat 600 calories, and women 500. This recommendation – a quarter of the average recommended calorie levels – was based on evidence from human and animal studies available at that time. Many succeeded using this strategy and lost weight, but some struggled. To make the diet more doable, I now suggest eating 800 calories on ‘fast days’. It’s easier to stick to and is still likely to produce significant weight loss.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHY CAN’T I HAVE TROPICAL FRUIT?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While it’s important to get our ‘five-a-day’, the emphasis should be on vegetables rather than on fruit. Fruit tends to be much higher in sugar, and while that might make it tastier, loading up on it is not great for the waistline or blood sugar levels. Tropical fruits such as bananas, mango and pineapple generally cause a much bigger sugar spike than apricots, peaches, apples, pears and strawberries. Apples and pears with skin will boost fibre intake.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>CAN I EAT BREAD?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some loaves can be calorific, especially when loaded with butter and marmalade. Two slices of toast – spread thickly with butter and jam – can add up to more than 400 calories, the same as you’d find in a chocolate muffin. If you crave bread, choose a loaf that contains nuts and seeds for fibre, or go for rye bread.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHAT IF I CAN’T HAVE GLUTEN?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I enjoy wholegrains like barley, rye and bulgar wheat as these release energy slowly and are high in bowel-friendly fibre. But they are best avoided by those with coeliac disease (in which the small intestine becomes inflamed due to an adverse reaction to gluten) or gluten-intolerance, as they all contain gluten. Instead, why not try buckwheat, corn, maize, polenta, pulses (beans and lentils), quinoa or brown rice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ask Dr Mosley: New 5.2 is ace but i need more energy for tennis</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>I have been following your 5:2 diet and have been successful with weight loss, but I struggle with a lack of energy after my daily tennis match.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>I’d love to take up running but worry about a drop in my blood sugar on fast days that may make me feel faint. What snacks would you recommend to boost my energy levels?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I would recommend a small handful of nuts, such as walnuts or almonds. They are high in fibre and healthy fats and will give you a decent amount of slow-releasing energy. A small handful of walnuts (14 halves) adds up to nearly 200 calories, but you should easily burn that and more with an hour of tennis. Perhaps try some full-fat Greek yogurt with a handful of berries. Again, the mixture of fat and protein will satisfy hunger and cost you only 150 calories, providing you stick to 100g of yogurt. A boiled egg is a good savoury option – lots of protein and only about 80 calories.</p><img id="i-5a6736a80a12cead" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/05/22/4BE015BD00000578-5694499-A_small_handful_of_walnuts_14_halves_adds_up_to_nearly_200_calor-a-3_1525557315477.jpg" height="481" width="634" alt="A small handful of walnuts (14 halves) adds up to nearly 200 calories, but you should easily burn that off and more with an hour of tennis" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>I am a 55-year-old man troubled by two prime health concerns for most of my life: insomnia and brittle bones.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">An oestopath has outlined the six most common causes of lower back pain and how to treat the discomfort without analgesics.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Hampshire-based Antonia Boulton, the most common cause of back pain is often muscle or joint strain, which can occur when lifting or overstretching.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rather than reaching for painkillers, such discomfort can usually be eased via hot and cold packs, as well as rest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other common causes include period pain or simply having poor posture at your desk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This comes after research released by the University of Warwick last month suggested many patients are needlessly prescribed strong painkillers, wrongly told to rest or even undergoing unnecessary surgery in a bid to treat lower back pain. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mounting evidence suggests simple exercises and stretches are more effective for easing symptoms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a piece for <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.healthista.com/6-causes-of-lower-back-pain-and-how-to-fix-them-without-painkillers/">Healthista</a>, Ms Boulton discusses how people can overcome crippling back ache.  </p><img id="i-c2b52dc5a31375ea" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/17/16/4B405EA500000578-5625967-image-a-91_1523978426711.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="An oestopath has outlined the six most common causes of back pain (stock)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Painkillers may not be effective</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A study has found painkillers don’t work for lower back pain. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ms Boulton outlines the causes of lower back pain and how to fix them without prescription medication.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lower back pain is now the leading cause of disability in the UK. It tops the list, responsible for more than one in 10 of all serious health complaints.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A major review has found that millions of people with back pain are being given the wrong treatment. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a bid to treat lower back pain – patients are being prescribed strong painkillers, undergoing unnecessary surgery or being told they should rest when that too is unnecessary. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Evidence shows that simple exercises and stretches are in fact more effective as a form of treatment than powerful painkillers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Growing evidence shows that painkillers are mostly ineffective and can do more harm than good. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Exercise, pilates, yoga and massages are preferable when treating lower back pain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From a small niggle to complete debilitation, lower back pain is a common problem that affects literally millions of people worldwide. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unfortunately, we are all likely to suffer at some stage in our lives and the usual solution is to reach for the painkillers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A clinical review published in the British Medical Journal reports that paracetamol, a common pain relieving medication, is ineffective for the treatment of lower back pain. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What’s more, the subjects in the studies who took paracetamol were shown to be four times more likely to have abnormal results on a liver function test. Not good news.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What are the alternatives to painkillers? </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Well, the most important question to consider first is what’s actually causing your lower back pain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By asking this question and discovering the correct diagnosis you’ll be able to choose the right techniques or treatments to get to the root cause and move towards a much speedier recovery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the most part, lower back pain is caused by strains to the soft tissues, the muscles, tendons or ligaments, and/or to the joints underlying them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back issues tend to be lumped together because quite often they have similar symptoms, but the underlying causes can be different and therefore the most effective treatment will vary.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here I have compiled six of the most common lower back problems I see in my clinic to help guide you towards the best form of treatment for your problem.</p><img id="i-a71abe7345d0fb2f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/17/16/4B405EB100000578-5625967-image-a-93_1523978455955.jpg"

causes </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Acute Muscle or Joint Strain</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is probably the most common injury to happen to the lower back and quite often occurs when lifting, over reaching or from a sporting injury. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Symptoms can include muscle spasm, pain (which can be severe) and restricted movement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Overreaching, twisting or stretching causes the muscles, tendons and ligaments in the area to tighten to prevent further damage and inflammation will build up as part of the natural healing process.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fast treatment is the most effective for this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">How to fix it:</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Disc prolapse </strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is a more serious condition that requires medical attention. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A prolapse means that the disc, the fluid-filled sac that sits between the vertebrae like a cushion, bulges out of place. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It can press on a nerve, causing pain or pins and needles down the leg. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Usually it is worse in the morning because the disc absorbs more fluid overnight, therefore making the bulge bigger. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It mostly occurs when lifting awkwardly or in a sporting injury. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You should consult your GP or health practitioner first for a correct diagnosis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">How to fix it:</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Initially rest is important, but once it has settled and on the advice of your medical practitioner, it is a good idea to strengthen the area. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I recommend Pilates because this targets the core muscles of the abdomen. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Strengthening the core muscles will support the lower back and reduce the risk of any further prolapse. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Try to find an experienced teacher and one who understands your problem.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Degenerative joint disease </strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As we grow older the discs that sit between the vertebrae in our back become thinner and the joints become more compressed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wearing of the cartilage in between can occur, known as degenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis (OA). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An injury can also contribute towards this, as can being overweight. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Contrary to popular belief there are plenty of ways to combat OA.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">How to fix it:</span></p><img id="i-d7b1dfa83f4a49e6"

degenerative joint disease" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Repetitive Strain Injury   </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More commonly seen in the upper body, this type of injury can occur in the lower back when an action is continually repeated over a long period of time, causing stress to the joints or soft tissues. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It happens due to a repetitive pattern in movement usually caused by work or sport. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, if at work you constantly have to turn to your right, the right side of your lower back could become compressed, irritated and inflamed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is important to address this issue quickly as it can fast become a debilitating injury.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">How to fix it: </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Work posture </strong></p><p

to Hampshire-based Antonia Boulton, the most common cause of back pain is often muscle or joint strain, which can occur when lifting or over reaching. Rather than reaching for painkillers, such discomfort can usually be eased via hot and cold packs, as well as rest. Other common causes include period pain or simply having poor posture at your desk.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Alex Thompson</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-04-18T01:17:36.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Do you suffer back pain? Osteopath outlines the 6 most common causes</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-04-18T01:17:36.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5625515/Listen-Mozart-taking-high-blood-pressure-pills.html" title="Listen to Mozart when taking high blood pressure pills: Classical music enhances the effects of the medication for an hour, study finds "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5625681/Study-finds-New-York-City-house-mice-hotbeds-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria.html" title="Forget rats - New York City house mice are the real danger!

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Do collagen supplements work?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What isn't so new is collagen supplements in the form of capsules and one of London's leading dermatologists Dr Stefanie Williams is a fan. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At her clinic, Eudelo Dermatology &amp; Skin Wellbeing, she often recommends a three month course to patients to support cosmetic treatments as well as taking it herself.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The body easily absorbs collagen supplements for quick rejuvenation, Dr Stefanie says  </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'A good collagen supplement can boost your own skin's collagen production', she says. 'Natural collagen is too huge a molecule to reach your skin intact after swallowing,' she explains. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'To be absorbed by the gut, it would have to be digested into smaller units. Collagen supplements contain small collagen fragments – peptides and amino acids – which are easily absorbed by the small intestine and distributed throughout the body via the bloodstream, where they remain for up to 14 days.'</p><div class="mol-article-quote floatRHS health" id="mol-ca9a8ca0-1e60-11e8-8def-1d721a04853a">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> Studies do show an improvement to skin with the supplementation of collagen</div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's not possible to reverse ageing (but the way science is going, who knows what miracles are on the horizon – that's one thing millennials can look forward to).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, there are some studies that do show an improvement to skin with the supplementation of collagen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a double-blind placebo-controlled study on over 100 45- to 65-year-olds, researchers concluded there was a significant reduction of eye wrinkles in those who took a collagen supplement (called Verisol) daily for eight weeks, compared to those who took a placebo. And the effects continued four weeks later.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A similar study assessing 'skin elasticity, skin moisture, transepidermal water loss and skin roughness', found positive results, and a significant increase in 'collagen density, skin firmness and nasolabial fold depth' with the daily use of Pure Gold Collagen for 60 days.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How does collagen work in the body?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Looking at the collagen market is a minefield – or should I say a menu at a restaurant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Marine collagen from fish claims to improve skin firmness in eight weeks, while Dermacoll,used by Dr Stefanie Williams, is made of cattle cartilage called bovine.</p><div class="mol-article-quote floatRHS health" id="mol-e7df1290-1e60-11e8-8def-1d721a04853a">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> Our skin responds by increasing its own collagen production</div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Because there are suddenly unusually high amounts of collagen building blocks floating around, your skin is tricked into thinking there must be some breakdown – a major injury, perhaps,' says Dr Williams. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Skin responds by increasing its own collagen production conveniently using the building blocks we've supplied,' she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some experts aren't so convinced, such as London anti-ageing doctor, Dr. David Jack.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I was once told by a sales rep for one of the brands that "the presence of the hydrolyzed collagen tripeptides in the blood tricks the body into thinking it is in an anabolic state, so it releases growth factors to boost collagen levels in the skin." I've tried to research this and can't find anything whatsoever to support it so I suspect it is just based on someone's wild guess,' Dr Jack says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What's more, according some experts, if you're looking to improve the skin specifically, you won't get very far. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If it is the case that these growth factors essentially stimulate a fibrotic reaction in the body, then why would it just be the skin? Would it not happen in muscle and other tissues too?', asks Dr Jack. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Well, incidentally, a lot of these products rave that their collagen product could also soothe achy joints, improve gut health, and enhance athletic performance, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Collagen, like all other protein, is broken down during digestion, according to Maira Silva, a graduate of Biochemistry from Kings College London.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Collagen is not absorbed AS collagen, it is broken down into amino acids,' Silva says. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But it does provide the constituents required to synthesize more collagen in the body. Not much is required because our own collagen is recycled but a small amount can help since some is always lost.' </p><img id="i-565bd6cc4bae9aa" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/03/05/49BF9D4E00000578-5456533-Vida_Glow_is_one_of_the_latest_trendy_collagen_powders_that_can_-a-71_1520056529756.jpg" height="453" width="634" alt="Vida Glow is one of the latest trendy collagen powders that can be added to a coffee or shake" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What are collagen drinks?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you're looking at labels of powdered collagen supplements, chances are you'll come across the word 'hydrolzsed'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Broken down into smaller units, this type of collagen has become popular because it can be dissolved in both hot and cold liquids. Collagen coffee, collagen soup, or collagen smoothie, anyone?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not only are these powders easier to use, they're also easier to digest, according to Silva. 'Collagen is a fibrous protein (rather than a globular one) and so digestion of its native form is difficult.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hydrolyzed collagen on the other hand (also called gelatin), a by-product of collagen hydrolysis, is a much better form of collagen to be ingested because it's simply easier for the body to deal with.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Do be aware though, we are talking about a a product that comes from cows, chickens, fish and other animals, so if you're vegan, it's not for you.</p><div class="mol-article-quote floatRHS health" id="mol-1f585320-1e71-11e8-8def-1d721a04853a">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> By blending your sachet contents with your favorite smoothie or water, the collagen remains stable in liquid</div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Anita Sturnham, GP and dermatologist, agrees. 'In order for collagen in a supplement form to be active in the deeper dermal layers of the skin, the collagen has to survive the acid digestion in our stomach and then cross the intestinal barrier in our gastrointestinal tract, before it can reach the bloodstream.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Absorption studies confirm that within six hours of reaching the blood stream, 95 percent of the collagen has left the blood stream and can be found in the dermis, the layer of the skin where peptides are actually needed and where they can get to work to stimulate remodeling', she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pills and tablets have an absorption rate of 20 to 30 percent in comparison, according to marine collagen-makers Vida Glow. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Pills and tablets can take up to 40 minutes for the body to breakdown', they say.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another difference between powder forms and capsule supplements is the 'bioavalibility', or 'freshness' to you and me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'By blending your sachet contents with your favorite smoothie or water, the collagen remains stable in liquid for approximately 30 minutes, which is why pre-formulated liquid collagen is unlikely to be bioactive', says Dr Sturnham.</p><img id="i-645d3d2a41aa5cfd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/02/23/49BF9D6500000578-0-image-a-3_1520033178493.jpg" height="708" width="634" alt="Vitness Berry Boost is a fruity-flavored powder you can add to a beverage " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Not just a fishy drink  </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What these new sachet drinks do offer are a much more glamorized version of the common supplement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Up until now, a drink supplement has most often come as fishy-flavored granules thrown back in a shot. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Vitness now do berry and matcha flavors which are rather pleasant, especially added to nut milk for a sweet milkshake, for about $55. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What's more, they are bursting with added vitamins and minerals such as astaxanthin, hyaluronic acid, acai berry, raspberry, maca, green coffee bean and vitamin C, which have been shown to promote healthy skin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There are a lot of nutrients inside of these drinks which are good building blocks for collagen', says Dr Maryam Zamani, a leading oculoplastic surgeon and aesthetic doctor. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'However most people who do take a collagen drink are also those who eat better, exercise and generally look after themselves, so its hard to say whether it's the drink that's doing that or a combination of many different lifestyle choices', she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Do collagen drinks work?

These aren't necessarily accounted for.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Taking collagen orally has 'minimal if any effect and very temporary', says Dr Nick Lowe, a renowned London dermatologist. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They aren't locating the places you want them to work, like the neck, décolletage and hands where women usually find they are ageing. That's my scientific rationale.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Injections of your own platelets deliver the collagen directly to problem areas</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What may work for targeting that, albeit at a far heftier price, is the use of a new cosmetic treatment called PRP – Platelet Rich Plasma, which Dr Nick Lowe has been using for a couple of years. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Original collagen injections made from protein and connective tissues from cows fell out of favor a few years back due to dodgy side effects and injections were taken off the market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But PRP uses your own platelets in your blood plasma which contain high levels of growth factors and stimulate the skin cells to produce more collagen. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'That's also used to very successfully to increase hair growth in specific types of hair loss. If you correctly protect and maintain the skin, it can last a year or more.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The good thing about it is the results look natural because you're not injecting anything like volume fillers. Production of your own collagen gradually ages so it's a very natural appearance.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How can you boost collagen naturally? </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new drinkable skincare regimens can put you out $48 plus for a months supply, which isn't great news if you were already trying to cut back on your Starbucks morning coffee. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When it comes to the extortionate ones, skeptical Dr Jack says, 'Why spend $276 per month on what a simpler supplement [such as vitamin C] would do for less?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although the evidence that ingesting collagen has a positive effect on wrinkles and fine lines is 'not convincing', the evidence for foods and vitamins is, says anti-ageing nutritionist Rick Hay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Don't overlook the foods and vitamins which we have good research on. You may be better off taking ingredients that stimulate collagen production rather than straight collagen which may not directly impact on more formation', he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Vitamin C has a really positive effect on collagen cross-linking', says Rick Hay, nutritionist. 'It becomes like a mesh which plumps and lifts the skin'. And a vitamin C-packed orange will only cost you the change in your pocket.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hay delves more into the fruit bowl. 'Blueberries, raspberries, macqui berries and strawberries are filled with polyphenols and anthocyanidins, powerful antioxidants that can help fight free radical damage on the skin's surface', he says. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Bitter orange and bilberry have, as the name suggests, a bitter quality. Skin health is linked to digestive health, digestive function and regularity, and the bitter qualities of foods such as these will help promote a healthy liver and gallbladder function, resulting in better fat metabolism and toxin elimination which means the skin won't need to work as hard.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Jack, adds, 'I really don't think it's of any benefit taking collagen in supplements over a good protein with a wide spectrum of amino acids'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Or what easier way than making sure you're eating enough amino-acid high protein such as salmon, chicken, steak or plant-based sources (quinoa and soy products provide all of the essential amino acids).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Collagen and lifestyle</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Diet and genetics are only part of the collagen puzzle. Other lifestyle factors including smoking and high amount of sun exposure contribute to depleting collagen levels, and 'air pollution can age you by ten years', according to Dr Daniel Glass, leading Harley Street Dermatologist from The Dermatology Clinic. 'If you are looking to slow down the ageing process, I would recommend that you protect your skin from excessive skin damage and pollution'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are tempted by the collagen supplements, Dr. Glass recommends, 'the smaller collagen molecules are more effective, but this is difficult for a consumer to identify. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Therefore, I would suggest picking a supplement whose effectiveness is demonstrated in published clinical trials.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those that are successfully clinical trialed have a 'gold standard dose' anyway, according to Dr. Williams. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Therefore, 'my recommendation is 10g per day, that is 10,000mg. There are countless collagen drinks on the market, many of them too low in dose that contain, in my opinion, less effective types of collagen. it's also important to make sure the product is not stuffed with sugar or artificial sweeteners.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Otherwise, we can only have faith in face yoga, slatherings of SPF, hydration and a healthy diet.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons explain the ins and outs of various collagen products, including new powders that make the skin-rejuvenating protein drinkable.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Natalie Rahhal</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-03T09:27:58.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Could a collagen drink REALLY make you look younger?</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-03T09:27:58.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5450245/Selfies-make-snouts-look-BIGGER-drive-people-NOSE-JOBS.html" title="Selfies make noses look BIGGER than they are - and more people may be getting surgery to change the way they look on social media, study suggests"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5450577/The-popular-cosmetic-procedures-surgeries-revealed.html" title="The most popular cosmetic procedures and surgeries revealed: Business is booming, driven by Botox, fillers, breast lifts and lipo"></link></item><item><title>Mother, 44, diagnosed with deadly breast cancer claims she has cured herself by using cannabis oil after refusing to have chemotherapy </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5339261/Mother-44-cures-cancer-taking-cannabis-oil.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 10:42:57 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5339261</guid><description><![CDATA[Dee Mani, 44, from Birmingham, refused chemotherapy when she was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer - deemed the deadliest form - and instead opted to try cannabis oil.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>White bread vs wholemeal</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Due to the grains being ground down during processing, white and wholemeal breads have a higher glycaemic index (GI) than wholegrain bread. This  results in glucose being released into the bloodstream more quickly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Foods with a high GI index can can cause blood sugar spikes and have been liked to a raised risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Regular consumption of lower GI foods helps to regulate blood glucose levels, keeping us fuller for longer, and helping us eat fewer calories to keep our weight in check. </p><img id="i-54077d04d52f419e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/19/15/48522D4300000578-5289307-image-a-15_1516377179048.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Wholemeal bread has a lower glycaemic index (GI) which is healthier as it's better for our sugar levels (stock image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Furthermore, white bread is made from wheat that has had the germ and bran removed, thereby reducing the fibre, B group vitamins, vitamin E and minerals such as iron, zinc, magnesium and phosphorus.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wholemeal bread is made from wholegrains that have been milled to a fine texture, giving a plain brown appearance. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wholemeal flour contains more fibre than white flour. Wholemeal bread also contains more vitamins and minerals than many white breads, but has a higher GI than wholegrain breads. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What about white bread labelled 'high fibre'?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">High fibre white breads are white breads that have fibre added to them. This makes them a better choice than regular white bread especially for children (or fussy adults) who won't eat wholegrain bread.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Wholegrains </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wholegrain bread has a dense wholemeal flour base and well as lots of grain and seeds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They contains the entire grain: the bran (outer layer), endosperm (starchy middle layer) and germ (nutrient rich inner part). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's a rich source of carbohydrates, protein, unsaturated (good) fats, vitamins and minerals and healthy fats as well as three types of fibre: soluble, insoluble and resistant starch.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Diets high in wholegrains are linked to a reduced risk of health conditions such as excess weight and obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The high dietary fibre helps keep us feeling full. It  is also beneficial for bowel health by preventing constipation and feeding the 'good' gut bacteria which is likely to result in a number of health benefits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A recent study found a diet high in wholegrains was associated with a lower risk of bowel cancer.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Soy and linseed bread has the added benefit of healthy omega 3 fats. Wholegrain bread is low GI as are wholemeal breads with added grains. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Multigrain bread</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Often multigrain bread is made from white flour with some added grains. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite this, multigrain breads tend to have more fibre and a lower GI than white bread, resulting in longer lasting energy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Rye bread </strong></p><img id="i-534d53194bc98e19" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/19/15/48522E8600000578-5289307-image-a-16_1516377187772.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Wholegrain rye with added grains has more fibre and vitamins than light rye (stock image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rye bread has a heavier texture due to a lower gluten content (but it's not gluten free). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wholegrain rye with added grains has a higher fibre and vitamin content than light rye and has a lower GI, as does rye sourdough. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wholegrain rye is a good choice for health and even light rye is better than white. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sourdough </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sourdough bread has a lower GI due to the higher acidity level. Fibre, vitamin and mineral levels vary with the flour used, with wholegrain sourdough being the preferred choice. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Be sure to choose an authentic sourdough, as some are faux sourdough and contain yeast rather than the traditional starter.</p><img id="i-61009e10a5657367" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/19/17/485232C500000578-5289307-Sourdough_bread_has_a_lower_GI_due_to_the_higher_acidity_level_s-a-7_1516381689568.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Sourdough bread has a lower GI due to the higher acidity level (stock image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Authentic sourdough takes a long time to produce and results in an acidic and chewy bread, two features that lower the GI. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Look for a chewy texture and the absence of yeast in the ingredients, preferably with wholewheat flour or rye wholemeal, grains and seeds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Gluten free </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gluten free breads are made from an alternative grain to wheat, so as to avoid the wheat protein gluten. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Traditionally, gluten free breads have had a lower fibre content and higher GI than their wheat-containing counterparts, although, there are now some with added seeds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These breads are useful for people with a gluten intolerance such as coeliac disease, but offer no additional health benefits beyond regular breads for the rest of us. </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-fd928e20-fd2f-11e7-9ca9-c535415b1885">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">GLUTEN FREE FOODS CONTAIN MORE FAT AND LOWER PROTEIN AND FIBRE THAN EQUIVALENTS</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gluten free foods contain more fat, salt and sugar than their gluten-containing equivalents, and are generally more than twice has expensive, a study published yesterday  found.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Researchers at the University of Hertfordshire said it was clear that gluten free (GF) products offer no nutritional advantage to regular foods and are not a healthier alternative, which may surprise many consumers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They also found that gluten free foods were 159% more expensive than their regular counterparts.</p><img id="i-aacc18dd1c552c19" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/19/15/4845B15100000578-5289307-A_study_found_that_gluten_free_products_are_not_healthier_altern-a-13_1516376846086.jpg" height="391" width="586" alt="A study found that gluten free products are not healthier alternatives to regular food – and they're considerably more expensive too (stock image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">More than 1,700 food products from <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/tesco/index.html" id="mol-fd9637a0-fd2f-11e7-9ca9-c535415b1885">Tesco</a>, <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/asda/index.html" id="mol-fd9637a1-fd2f-11e7-9ca9-c535415b1885">Asda</a>, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Ocado, were compared by researchers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They found that, with the exception of crackers, gluten free foods contained more fat, salt and sugar and also had lower fibre and protein content than their equivalents.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A GF diet is the only treatment option for those who suffer from coeliac disease but many more people in the UK and around the world avoid gluten foods as it is perceived to contribute towards a healthy lifestyle. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This has lead to a huge increase in sales of GF foods in recent years. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A gluten free diet – of which <span style="font-size: 16px;">Victoria Beckham Gwyneth Paltrow and Miley Cyrus are said to be fans – </span>avoids the proteins found in wheat, rye and barley.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Advocates believe our modern diets have become increasingly high in refined wheat products and believe over consumption may lead to digestive symptoms such as bloating, pain and stomach cramps in those who are sensitive to gluten.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is believed that around 13 per cent of the UK population are gluten-free. And the figure is even higher in the US, with a quarter saying they had consumed such foods in 2015 – a 67 per cent increase in two years. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The findings come after gastroenterologist Dr Suzanne Mahady, a senior lecturer, Monash University, earlier this week said only those diagnosed with coeliac disease – caused by a reaction of the immune system to gluten, which is different to gluten sensitivity <span style="font-size: 16px;">– should keep to the strict diet.</span> </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>FODMAP breads </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Low FODMAP breads have recently hit the market.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Tobacco giant Philip Morris International aims to stop selling cigarettes in the UK, it announced on Wednesday in a new advertising campaign. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Marlboro-maker's move is the latest in a wave of big tobacco companies' - including the unaffiliated Philip Morris USA - efforts to re-brand themselves in an increasingly anti-smoking world.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Philip Morris International (PMI) also launched a new website, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://smokefreefuture.co.uk/">smokefreefuture.co.uk </a>to inform and encourage its UK customers to quit. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its campaign is also pushing PMI's smokeless products, such as e-cigarettes, as healthier alternatives - an initiative that backfired against Philip Morris USA earlier this year when the legitimacy of its internal studies on e-cigarettes was called into question.</p><img id="i-3f6c9a8cca26d525" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/03/23/47BC9EEA00000578-5233401-image-m-2_1515021204395.jpg" height="219" width="634" alt="Philip Morris International's new advertising campaign promises that it is now dedicated to switch from cigarettes to safer alternatives, along with its customers" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">PMI placed advertisements in a number of UK-based newspapers today, with the abbreviated ones stating simply, in the company's signature shades of blue that 'Our New Year's Resolution' is that 'we're trying to give up cigarettes.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its full-page advertisement details the actions that PMI has taken and plans to take to ween itself and its customers after the cigarettes it 'is known for.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Recent events indicate that big tobacco companies around the world are finally accepting that cigarettes, their bread and butter, may finally be on their way out amid irrefutable evidence that cigarette smoking is the leading cause of early death.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, tobacco companies are embracing anti-smoking messaging - albeit, a bit late in the game - and the international trend toward e-cigarette use. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Between 2014 and 2015, sales of battery powered, smokeless vaping devices surged by 14.4 percent across the US as cigarette sales slowly continued to peter out, declining by 1.4 percent. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an effort to join the growing e-cigarette industry, Philip Morris USA sought Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its iQOS device last year. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The FDA has not yet issued its decision on the product, but reports of inconsistencies and low quality research that surfaced last month do not bode well for the company's foray into the vape market.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Several countries, including the UK have passed laws requiring cigarette cartons to be devoid of appealing advertising, and, in some places, to feature graphic health warnings instead. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This sort of legislation was met by outrage and concern by big tobacco companies and lobbyists, but recent research has suggested that, at least among teenagers at risk of taking up smoking - the warnings may have the opposite of the desired effect. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But in the face of this change, PMI is taking a different approach with today's announcement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In its full-page advertisement, the company said that its 'ambition is to stop selling cigarettes' to the 6.7 million smokers in the UK, because 'the best action they can take is to quit smoking.' </p><img id="i-ab6eefcd1e67d3b4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/03/23/47BC9EEA00000578-5233401-The_big_tobacco_company_laid_out_its_new_initiatives_in_full_pag-m-7_1515021579641.jpg" height="791" width="632" alt="The big tobacco company laid out its new initiatives in full-page advertisements in several UK newspapers, but anti-smoking organizations are dubious of its claims" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">For those that will continue to smoke, the company wants to 'replace cigarettes with products, such as e-cigarettes and heated tobacco which are a better choice.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">PMI claims to have already invested the equivalent of $3 billion USD in developing the products in Europe. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The company promised to back government quitting campaigns and to seek approval for quitting and 'switching' informational inserts to put in its cigarette packs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">PMI's own anti-smoking website, smokefreefuture.co.uk, is curiously 'only intended for UK and Ireland residents,' and is not accessible from people seeking information from 'restricted' countries, including the US.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You might wonder if we really mean it.

Sip water slowly</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If your mother swears by a glass of warm water to ease trapped wind then she knew what she was talking about.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Dr Wakim-Fleming, this does two things. Firstly it can help to get any undigested foods to get moving through your digestive system.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The walls of the intestines are lined with layers of muscle that contract as they move food through your digestive tract. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So secondly, sipping water prevents them from contracting too quickly and strongly, creating painful spasms. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. Reduce the amount of air you swallow</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Drinking water helps but don't take big gulps o at a time, warns Dr Wakim-Fleming. Avoid using straws, drinking fizzy beveragesand chewing gum. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don't talk and eat at the same time, sit down to eat (sitting upright and not slumped over), and chew with your mouth closed so that you're not taking in excess air.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. Get up and walk around</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It might feel like that last thing you want to do when you're in agony, but some gentle exercise can  help clear up painful gas and bloating. A quick walk or other gentle movement can work wonders.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Try doing toe touch stretches to let gravity  work to get the gas out of your body.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Twisting exercises can help push air out of digestive system, this can be done in a chair or on the ground. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sit with your feet facing forward then rotate your torso to the right and reach around to hold back of the chair, then repeat other direction. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4. Cut down on dairy if you think it is  the culprit</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the main symptoms of lactose intolerance is bloating. But even if you aren't intolerant, dairy is well known for causing indigestion and it's possible you've overindulged on the cheeseboard and creamy Bailey's.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Dr Staller, many people in their twenties and thirties have symptoms and don’t suspect that it’s the dairy products.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So if you suspect dairy is contributing to your painful wind, try cutting it out for a few weeks – or at the very least, the rest of the day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5. Drink peppermint tea</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Peppermint is said to relieve bloating by relaxing your muscles and allowing you to release any pent up gas or flatulence, says Dr Staller.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has a spasmolytic affect, meaning it can help your intestines from cramping – which is what increases wind.</p><img id="i-476cdb8b01b29fb2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/26/02/4781653F00000578-5202889-Peppermint_tea_is_said_to_relieve_bloating_by_relaxing_the_muscl-a-8_1514254048473.jpg" height="422" width="633" alt="Peppermint tea is said to relieve bloating by relaxing the muscles in your digestive system (stock image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">While this is well known to happen with sufferers of irritable bowel syndrome, the same process of muscle contractions occurs during general bouts of trapped wind, he explained.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Peppermint tea should not be given to small children or infants or taken by people with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Check with your doctor if you're unsure if you should take it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>6. Apply a heated pad on your stomach</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don't forget that exercising and movement helps – but along with this you could try cozying up under a blanket with a heated pad on your abdomen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Warmth can have an antispasmodic effect on your body and help your intestines to relax instead of contract too hard or too much, said Dr Wakim-Fleming.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>7. Up your fiber intake</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We're always told to up our fiber intake to help keep our digestive systems running smoothly.It bulks up your stool, which helps you stay regular and avoid constipated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But on the other hand, consuming too much  can make you gassy as the bacteria in your colon works to break this tough nutrient down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The vegetables you've had on your Christmas dinner, especially broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage, can cause problems. It's <span style="font-size: 16px;">best to avoid those foods until you feel better.</span> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Flatulence occurs when food fails to breakdown  in the stomach and intestines.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">When something bad happens to you, is it possible to pass on this psychological trauma to your children? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Can our experiences somehow live on in the next generation?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Should you worry that if your childhood was very difficult, this could somehow affect people further down the family tree, years later?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These are questions that humans have pondered for a long time, and until the discovery of genes (which seemed to indicate inheritance doesn't work like this) there were various theories about how one generation passed things on to the next.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The psychoanalyst Carl Jung came up with the fanciful notion of the collective unconsciousness; that there existed an unconscious mind that was shared by all people and which collected our unconscious thoughts and experiences and put them in a sort of melting pot that influenced our behaviour without us realising it.</p><img id="i-6fce3e2110174975" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/01/22/46E417BC00000578-5137649-image-a-1_1512168517076.jpg" height="413" width="634" alt="When something bad happens to you, is it possible to pass on this psychological trauma to your children? Asks Dr Max Pemberton" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another popular theory was that things that happened to people in life were literally passed on physically down the generations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The French scientist Lamarck used the giraffe as an example and concluded that as it stretched its neck to reach the top leaves on a tree, the neck got longer — and this longer neck was passed on to future generation. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Obviously this isn't true, or things such as scars would also be passed on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the advent of genetic science put all these theories to rest. We finally understood that we inherited sets of genetic information from our parents, and that these were fixed. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our genetic make up didn't change depending on what happened to us during our lives but was set at birth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, we've now realised this also isn't true. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The birth of epigenetics — the study of how our environment affects genes and the way they are expressed — has produced some startling revelations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This week, a fascinating piece of research was published which flew in the face of much of the basic understanding of genetic inheritance. </p><img id="i-5b45ac52f9302627" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/01/22/46E3E6EE00000578-5137649-image-m-4_1512168539473.jpg" height="655" width="634" alt="The psychoanalyst Carl Jung (pictured) came up with the fanciful notion of the collective unconsciousness; that there existed an unconscious mind that was shared by all people and which collected our unconscious thoughts and experiences and put them in a sort of melting pot that influenced our behaviour without us realising it" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It showed that childhood trauma can be passed on from one generation to the next — and that this can have serious implications for the mental health of the family's future generations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So those early ideas weren't so fanciful after all. The study looked at the offspring of children displaced due to World War II, and showed that childhood trauma altered genes that could then be passed on to future generations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These altered genes made people more susceptible to mental health problems such as depression.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The study found the next generation was four times more likely to experience mental health problems.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not only does this show how immensely complex genetics are (we clearly have only the faintest grasp of them), but this research has tremendous implications for both society and individuals. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Poverty and inequality does not just affect this generation, it jeopardises the mental health of the next — and we're storing up trouble for ourselves unless we do more to improve the living standards of poor children.</p><img id="i-32334d89e49d6ad6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/01/22/46E3EDC500000578-5137649-image-m-5_1512168549327.jpg" height="538" width="634" alt="The French scientist Lamarck (pictured) used the giraffe as an example and concluded that as it stretched its neck to reach the top leaves on a tree, the neck got longer — and this longer neck was passed on to future generation" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I also think it gives weight to the need to step in early and remove children from abusive families.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it has implications for many other people, too. If you've had a difficult upbringing, for instance, is that it? Are your progeny condemned to inherit this?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is where I think things are very interesting. There's some evidence that addressing the trauma helps to nullify the effect it has on genes. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tackling the problems that you've had in your life —– by having psychotherapy, for example, to process and understand the trauma and allow yourself to move on from this — can reverse the risk that your genes will be altered and passed on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It also emphasises the importance of early mental health input if youngsters are having a difficult time. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So if you're concerned about your child or grandchild, don't assume things will blow over: get professional help.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This science is still in its infancy, but it does suggest the 'stiff upper lip' mentality and trying to ignore our difficulties can have repercussions for generations to come.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>NHS cash wasted on private contracts </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We were told that allowing private companies to compete for contracts to deliver NHS services would improve quality of care and push down costs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it's been an expensive disaster and resulted in an inferior system. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Quite how ludicrous the situation is was demonstrated this week in reports that Virgin Care, part of Richard Branson's empire, had threatened to sue the NHS after losing out on a contract to provide a three-year, £82 million deal covering health visitors, school nurses and occupational therapy in Surrey.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The cases have now been settled and are 'confidential' but it seems one local health authority's liability was £328,000.</p><img id="i-18664a9da2be3f8c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/01/23/0E8FCBEA00000578-5137649-Virgin_Care_part_of_Richard_Branson_s_pictured_empire_has_report-a-6_1512170864114.jpg" height="456" width="634" alt="Virgin Care, part of Richard Branson's (pictured) empire, has reportedly threatened to sue the NHS after losing out on a contract to provide a three-year, £82 million deal covering health visitors, school nurses and occupational therapy in Surrey" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I feel sick to the pit of my stomach that while blind or crippled elderly people are being denied cataract surgery or a knee operation, bully-boy companies such as Virgin Care are suing the NHS. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And why are the terms confidential, when it's our money being paid out?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Competition was supposed to be about patient choice.

One of the first encounters I had with a patient was when a nurse paged me to prescribe paracetamol.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I went to the ward and the nurse pushed the prescription chart in front of me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I froze. I knew what you gave paracetamol for, and I even knew the pharmacology behind how it worked. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But how to actually prescribe — the doses, what to write and where, how often it should be given and so on — was something that doctors weren't taught at medical school.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The nurse looked at me and, barely able to control her smugness, whispered '1g QDS' (abbreviated Latin for 'four times a day'). I scribbled it down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We weren't taught how to prescribe drugs at medical school because that's not the hard bit. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The hard bit is knowing how they work, why they work, why some interact with others. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The hard bit is working out what's wrong with someone. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's differentiating between a sub-arachnoid brain haemorrhage and a headache that takes six years at medical school and countless years of training afterwards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That's why the majority of prescribing on a ward is done by the doctors. In fact the juniors rarely prescribe anything stronger than a painkiller without the say-so of a much more senior and experienced doctor.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My heart sank when I heard the latest hare-brained scheme from NHS bosses to allow paramedics to prescribe medication. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Under controversial reforms, ambulance workers with special training will be able to take on duties traditionally performed by GPs and hospital doctors, so more patients can be treated on the spot.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let's be clear here: this has nothing to do with what's best for the patient. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like the proposals to get GP receptionists to triage patients, NHS bosses are just trying to stop sick people coming to hospital and seeing a doctor.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The NHS is bursting at the seams and — amid desperate staff shortages and underfunding — bosses are getting increasingly desperate to plug the tidal wave of patients deluging A&amp;E. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But you can't cut corners with cheap and cheerful alternatives without there being consequences. </p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I'm profoundly worried about the effect that hours of staring at a screen has on the tender, developing brains of children — so I welcome recommendations this week that their time on smartphones and TV should be limited to 90 minutes a day. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Researchers say this would help to stave off obesity.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The flexibility of the vagina is impressive – it can stretch to accommodate a penis as well as rather large babies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But can sex have an effect? It's a question that's been debated repeatedly over the years. And if so, is it permanent?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now gynecologists have set the record straight: and the answer is yes and no. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The vagina is basically a muscular rubber band that stretches during sex and returns to its original shape and size,' Dr Michelle Metz told <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/can-sex-stretch-out-vagina">Women's Health</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An exception is however, the very first time you have sex as this will cause a change in the size of the vagina.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The hymen – a membrane that surrounds or partially covers the external vaginal opening – will break or tear which can sometimes lead to mild bleeding. And 'the vaginal opening increases in size,' explained Dr Metz.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The vaginal wall can also stretch if you have sex with men with different-sized penises, according to the New York-based board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist.</p><img id="i-15580ae52a35c881" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/22/08/46985A1700000578-0-image-a-1_1511339204529.jpg" height="413" width="634" alt="The vaginal wall can also stretch if you have sex with men with different-sized penises partners – but this is not permanent say experts (stock image) " class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">If you're a gym bunny, it's likely that you give most of your muscles a fair bit of attention. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there's one group of muscles that don't get talked about enough and certainly don't get enough TLC. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our pelvic floor muscles are crucial, not only for supporting our organs from the bladder to the anus (and everything in between) but they also have a big impact on our sex lives. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Reports suggest that one-third of adult women in the UK are affected by pelvic floor disorders which can leave them with a whole host of problems including incontinence and an unwillingness to have sex due to pain, lack of feeling or simply embarrassment. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Intimate health brand Intimina found that only half of women asked feel confident in their pelvic floor muscles. And on top of that, only 35 percent of them admitted to performing Kegel exercises only sometimes and a further 19 percent revealed they performed them almost never.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We spoke to three women's physiotherapists about why it's so important to keep on top of those muscles and the different ways we can exercise to strengthen our pelvic floor – and improve our sex lives in the process.</p><img id="i-2b4fea0d7bcde56f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/02/13/45F0809B00000578-5043029-image-a-2_1509630752991.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Pelvic floor muscles are key for agility, control and endurance during sex. Three physiotherapists explain why they are so essential - and how to control your sexual prowess with these moves" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How will training my pelvic floor improve my sex life?</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So how can this muscle help improve sex? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Physiotherapist, physiopilates instructor and spokesperson for the Professional Network of Pelvic, Obstetric and Gynaecological Physiotherapists Amanda Savage, puts it simply – 'Vaginal sensation is felt with pressure and deep touch more than light sensations. Sexual pleasure comes from the movement and build-up of friction against the vaginal walls. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The vaginal walls are layered with the pelvic floor muscles. Pelvic floor muscle exercises tone and strengthen these muscles, improving blood supply and nerve activity, all leading to greater pleasure. Many women report they are able to reach orgasm more easily, and that their orgasms are more powerful, after focusing on pelvic floor muscle exercises.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These muscles are big players when it comes to penetrative sex and like other muscles, when we build them up, they get stronger and bulkier. Physiotherapist and PhD student, Kate Lough describes how improving the strength of this muscle can spice up your sex life. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If you go to the gym for six months you'll see a difference, your shoulders and hamstrings might get more muscular – it's the same with your pelvic floor. You will get a bulkier pelvic floor that is going to take up more room and it will mean that the space available for a penis or whatever you're using will be smaller and you may be more aware of what's going in and out.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it isn't just physical, Lough explains that it's psychological too, 'If you've got a fantastic pelvic floor and you feel that it's worthy of some really great sex, the chances are you're going to have some really great sex. If you feel as though your pelvic floor muscles are weak and your partner says 'It's not the same since you had the kids' the loss of confidence can be just as big a factor as the possibility of weaker muscles for less satisfactory sex. Knowing that your pelvic floor muscles can improve can help you build your self-confidence.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We spoke to three women's health physio experts about the different ways to exercise our pelvic floor and spice our sex life up in the process. First, the basics.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How to contract your pelvic floor</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The simplest, easiest, cheapest way to do pelvic floor exercises (and the way that's been around for thousands of years) is to tighten and release your muscles' says Savage. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So how exactly is that done? Lough explains it in a way that might leave you blushing but makes the technicalities of the movement very clear. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I always tell people to think about their back passage and imagine they're going to slide a poo back up the tube. If you can't go to the toilet for some reason, you have to slide it back up the storage cupboard – tighten up your back passage as much as you can and draw right in.' </p><img id="i-6d90ebd6605183fe" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/02/13/45F080B100000578-5043029-image-a-3_1509630769593.jpg" height="507" width="634" alt="Pelvic floor muscles support our organs from the bladder to the anus (and everything in between) but they also have a big impact on our sex lives" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">And if that doesn't make much sense to you? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If that doesn't work you can think about where your labia are – and try and close them together tight or try to tuck your wee hole under the bone at the front. You can sit on your hands so that your bum bones are on your hands and then try and slide your bum bones together without clenching your buttocks,' (don't forget to breathe!) Got it? Right, the next step is to try and hold the muscle contraction and then release.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="health-ccox"><span class="mol-style-underline">To build endurance:</span> squeeze and hold</span></strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Much like a bicep, Savage explains that there is only one type of contraction that you can do with your pelvic floor. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Your bicep muscle has one action – it folds your hand towards your arm. Your pelvic floor has its own special action, drawing in and sucking – it's the movement you do when you're trying to hold your wee or stop yourself from passing wind.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The amount of time you're able to hold for will vary from woman to woman but if you have no dysfunction, the experts say you should aim to hold for around 10 seconds. Christien Bird, women's health physio and owner of the White Hart Clinic suggests doing this hold 10 times – and then doing that twice a day to see the best results.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-underline">To build speed:</span> short, powerful squeezes</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Building up your pelvic floor muscle is not only going to make you feel more confident in the bedroom but if you suffer from a weaker pelvic floor this exercise also has the power to make a huge difference to your day-to-day life. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pelvic floor muscles kick in when we sneeze, pass wind or feel that our bladder might leak. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By practising short, powerful squeezes we can improve their capabilities and learn to squeeze them in time to cough, keeping our wee in our bladder. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Using the technique that you learned in exercise one Savage explains, 'Like all muscles in the body the pelvic floor muscles can perform in different ways. Practice short, powerful squeezes (10-15 in a row).' Draw your muscles in quickly and release, repeating this in short bursts.</p><img id="i-28b6ed60df2f321b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/02/13/45F080A400000578-5043029-image-m-6_1509630785720.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="Practice short, powerful squeezes (10-15 in a row), physiotherapist Amanda Savage says" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-underline">For mid-sex pleasure:</span> hold while he's inside you</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now it's time to put that endurance building squeeze and hold into practice. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As Lough says, 'It's good to know where those muscles are and then when it comes to your sex life you can decide to have a bit of fun with it. During sex, you can squeeze and try and get your partner to feel it. Use those muscles for some effect, for some fun.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The more firmed and toned you are, the more you'll feel yourself and your partner during sex and according to the professionals, this will help to improve your orgasms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-underline">To reduce muscle tension:</span> don't forget to release</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bird explains that one thing that is incredibly important to remember is that releasing those muscles is just as essential as tightening them up. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like some women are unable to tighten those muscles, other women may find it difficult to let them go. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's like if you lift your arm and hold it with a weight to strengthen it – you don't leave your arm up there, you bring it down again. It's very easy to store a lot of tension in your pelvic floor and you can get pains and your muscles can go into spasms.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It can be the result of urinary tract infections, bouts of cystitis or even stress and anxiety that causes your muscles to tense but one thing is for certain, it can have a huge impact on intimacy. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There's a group of women we see that have pain during sex and that can be due to an overactive pelvic floor.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While suffering from this may mean having to see a professional, there are ways that you can work on this in the privacy of your own home. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'On your own, you can practice releasing your pelvic floor. Try and tighten up your pelvic floor and if you don't feel much movement there, you may already be tensing. Release your tummy and let that space between your bum bones open out – it's really about feeling your tummy go really floppy… if you're struggling with this, it may be useful to go and see a physio.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-underline">For a multi-purpose exercise:</span> squat</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From building strength to burning calories, we've all heard about the benefits of squatting. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there may just be one more. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When you squat, you contract your glutes – your big bottom muscles. If you do that and you're lucky enough to be someone that has an automated co-contraction of your pelvic floor then without you doing anything else you can just squat and your pelvic floor muscles will kick in,' explains Bird. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While this is a great way for many women to exercise the pelvic floor, it doesn't work for everyone. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And in some rare cases such as prolapse, it can even be damaging which is why the experts insist it's important for you not to feel embarrassed about any problems you may have. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lough says 'Some women have real issues around prolapse – they join a gym and are too embarrassed to tell the instructor about their problem and then they get inappropriate exercises which are loaded with too much pressure and their pelvic floors are too weak to cope with them.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a rule, the experts say if any exercise starts to make your problem worse – go and see an expert.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-underline">For a confidence boost:</span> Pilates</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you've got the squeezing and tensing down, Pilates can really help with pelvic floor training. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Savage explains: 'All Pilates exercises aim to work your core muscles together as a group.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The core muscles used are your abdominals, your pelvic floor, your back muscles and your diaphragm. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You first focus on learning to use each one separately (the basic pelvic floor, the basic abdominals, the basic breath) but then the goal of Pilates is to use them all in balance together. </p><img id="i-6cd5ef0d2ca103ca" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/02/13/45F080BE00000578-5043029-image-a-5_1509630779670.jpg" height="431" width="634" alt="Pilates exercises aim to work your core muscles together as a group" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Once you are certain that you are definitely using your pelvic floor correctly you will include your pelvic floor in all your pilates exercises too. You will be practising using your pelvic floor muscles not just in isolation but as part of all movements. This is a great progression from the basic pelvic floor exercises as in real life all our muscles have to work together and we have to do lots of complex movements.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While Pilates has been heralded as helping with pelvic floor training, the experts fall on two sides. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lough believes that Pilates can be very useful for many women hoping to train their pelvic floor but adds, 'some women will tell me how they used to leak and since doing a Pilates DVD for six months they feel better and they'll say it's all because of those exercises. It may be because of those exercises but it might also be because they've taken the time to look after themselves properly for the first time and if they'd done any other exercise they may have seen the same results.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pelvic floor specialist admits there can be a hugely positive psychosexual impact. 'If you're doing things that make you feel good, you generally have more confidence and you'll feel that things are better.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In turn, this newfound confidence will spice things up in the bedroom.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While there are no magic Pilates moves that you can specifically do to target your pelvic floor, Savage suggests paying extra attention to your pelvic floor while exercising to ensure you're engaging the muscles. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If you have a problem with your pelvic floor muscles (clues are incontinence or vaginal prolapse) it is important not to rush up to the advanced levels of Pilates too quickly. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You and your instructor need to keep checking that your abdominal wall is not bulging and that you don't feel pressure below in the vagina with any of the tasks. If you do feel pressure below you need to go back down a pilates level. Not all Pilates instructors will emphasise the pelvic floor.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-underline">The digital fix:</span> pelvic floor toning apps</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the age of all answers coming from the internet, is it any wonder that there's an app for pelvic floor training too? Multiple apps in fact. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Physiotherapist Bird is a fan of one created by the NHS called the Squeezy app, 'it gives you notifications to remind you to train. If you know how to do an effective contraction and how long you can hold for you can individualise your training (although you may need an assessment for this) and it gives you really simple instructions on how to do your exercises. It costs a couple of pounds but it has a visual aid that goes up and down as you squeeze and you have to keep up with it – that will help you train your speed.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-underline">For a bit of help:</span> pelvic floor trainers</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And if you're really struggling to do it on your own, there are plenty of gadgets you can invest in. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are a whole host of pelvic floor trainers that work in a variety of ways. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The experts say that if you're struggling to train your pelvic floor simply by following instructions to squeeze and you aren't able to see a professional, a gadget might be the thing for you. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trainers like Elvie can be inserted into your vagina and then tracked and used from your phone and others such as the Intimina use vibrations to help you squeeze and a sensor to help you progress by moving you up a level depending on your performance. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With the Elvie being handed out at goodie bags in this year's Emmy's, this once taboo trend is turning over a stylish leaf (if it's good enough for the red carpet, it's good enough for us).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>This article was originally published by <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.healthista.com/8-best-pelvic-floor-exercises-that-will-spice-up-your-sex-life/">Healthista</a></strong> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Pelvic floor muscles are key for agility, control and endurance during sex.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Every night, in homes across the country, bedrooms reverberate with the trumpeting, whistling, whining and grunting of the nation’s snorers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s a deafening cacophony that blights an estimated 60 per cent of the population — and their long-suffering partners — and fuels a lucrative and ever-growing trade in snore-busting gadgets and remedies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But as anyone who’s tried the throat sprays, nasal dilators, jaw slings or mouth splints that claim to ease snoring will know, snoring is infuriatingly difficult to fix.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is just one more insulting consequence of the ageing process, and therefore extremely common. But despite that, few people appreciate quite how debilitating it can be for your health and your relationships.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Scroll down for video </strong></p><img id="i-b1df1a953c75e798" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/09/15/20/3BE0577500000578-4889158-image-a-1_1505503742055.jpg" height="480" width="634" alt="At night, when we drift into the deepest phases of sleep and all our muscles relax, the tissues at the back of the throat can become floppy, causing the air that passes through them to makes a noise like a flag flapping in the wind" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">As one of the UK’s top ear, nose and throat consultants, I see a regular stream of patients whose lives are blighted by the sounds they make when they’re asleep. But I am convinced that the vast majority of snoring cases can be swiftly and inexpensively fixed — by spending just five minutes a day doing a few simple throat exercises.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The plethora of gadgets and sprays on the market rarely work — but my studies show that these exercises definitely do.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>FROM AGEING TO BOOZE, WHY SNORING HAPPENS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although the shape of your face, skull and neck could make you more susceptible to snoring, and a blocked nose, enlarged tonsils and a heavy night of alcohol will make things worse, the single most common cause is slack throat muscles.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At night, when we drift into the deepest phases of sleep and all our muscles relax, the tissues at the back of the throat can become floppy, causing the air that passes through them to makes a noise like a flag flapping in the wind.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The volume and intensity of those snores will depend partly on the turbulence of the airflow (how hard you have to force the lungs to push air through this restricted space) and partly on the resonance (or floppiness) of the tissues of your throat. These include the soft palate (the fleshy part at the back of the roof of the mouth), the uvula (the dangly thing at the back of your throat) and the epiglottis (the flap of tissue which sits beneath the tongue at the back of the throat and closes the windpipe while you are eating to prevent food entering your airways).</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">As these tissues vibrate they trap air against the back wall of the throat for a split second, causing a high pressure build-up of air and subsequent sound waves, like that produced when you clap your hands together.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are overweight the problem — and volume — will be exacerbated as layers of fat increase the pressure on the windpipe when you are lying down, forcing your lungs to work harder to push air through the restricted gap.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A few drinks will make snoring worse, too, because alcohol acts as a sedative, keeping you for longer in the deep sleep that relaxes all your muscles — including the muscles of your throat and tongue.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-65afe360-9a4b-11e7-bb28-a57ff696037e">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">'I used to snore half the night'</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><img id="i-bd555dbc43597f4b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/09/15/20/4451795400000578-4889158-image-m-10_1505503954061.jpg" height="383" width="284" alt="'Derek is a heavy sleeper but my kids say they can hear it when they¿re coming up the stairs,' said his wife, Maxine (pictured)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic">Maxine Severn, 52 is a school administrator. She lives in Birmingham with husband Derek, 65, a retired stockbroker’s clerk. They have two children, aged 24 and 27. Maxine says:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was recently away on a school trip and people mentioned that my snoring was horrendous. Derek is a heavy sleeper but my kids say they can hear it when they’re coming up the stairs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When I set up the app I was shocked to find I was snoring for more than half the night, mostly at ‘epic’ levels, so I was happy to try the exercises. I found most of them pretty easy. You look silly, but it works.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My snoring plummeted from 50 per cent to 9 per cent of the night! I’m getting much more deep sleep, giving me the energy to improve my fitness and lose weight, which will help the snoring even more.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHY IT’S BAD FOR YOU...</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The snorer might sound as if they are blissfully sleeping, but their body will be struggling to get air in and out through slack and floppy airways and this extra effort will ultimately compromise the quality of the deeply restorative phases of sleep.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is the time when the vitally important mental and physical repair process is supposed to happen, and the heart should be able to slow and rest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although snoring is more likely to occur if you are overweight, it can also trap you in a vicious cycle whereby the snoring itself triggers weight gain. Studies show poor sleep typically stimulates the appetite for sweet and fatty foods as your body fights to cope with fatigue.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As long-term snoring causes protracted sleep deprivation, which in turn means your snoring worsens, the weight piles on. This then increases your risk of obesity-related disorders such as diabetes, heart disease, even some cancers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>... AND YOUR RELATIONSHIPS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Snoring is a potent trigger for bitterness, ridicule and resentment in relationships and studies show that for around 6 per cent of couples, bad snoring can be enough to trigger marriage breakdown.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Inveterate snorers, and therefore their bed partners, rarely get close to achieving even the lower recommended target of six hours of restful sleep each night. Studies show the partner of a snorer loses 90 minutes of sleep most nights and so gradually builds a sleep debt that can never be replenished.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-6972b7c0-9a4b-11e7-bb28-a57ff696037e">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Humming can help!</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Try this short, effective and fun stop-snoring exercise:</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s nothing sexy about snoring, and it is such a subject of ridicule that the psychological trauma of appearing unattractive to your partner (even when asleep) can have irrevocable consequences for both sexes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Studies show men and women who are deprived of sleep report lower libidos and less interest in sex due to depleted energy, sleepiness and increased tension. Men are often alarmed to learn that snoring can have a direct effect on their ability to maintain an erection, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over time, the elevated blood pressure caused by regular snoring will damage the blood vessels, making them thicker and restricting blood flow — a problem which very often affects the tiny capillaries of the sex organs first.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If your snoring is a source of stress between you, this can make ‘performance anxiety’ worse, and concern about ‘underperformance’ can be the kiss of death for a sexual relationship.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>REMEDY THAT'S FREE AND SIMPLE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s not surprising that so many snorers search for solutions on the chemist’s shelves. But they may well be wasting their time — and money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the vast majority of cases the problem can be cured — or massively reduced — for free.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Studies have shown that if you exercise those slackened throat muscles, just as you would your quads or biceps in the gym, you can build back their strength and tone, and return the structures of your throat to their former youthful condition.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stopping snoring is within your grasp — and it’s as simple as committing to a few minutes of throat exercises every day.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-e057d740-9a4a-11e7-bb28-a57ff696037e">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">'This has stopped me keeping my wife awake'</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><img id="i-f5110c8934589c0a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/09/15/20/43FA2ABC00000578-4889158-image-m-7_1505503867206.jpg" height="399" width="284" alt="Robin George (above): 'My snoring had definitely worsened with age'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Robin George, 63, a magician, lives in Purley, Surrey, with his wife Sharon, 63. They have two daughters aged 30 and 28. Robin says:</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My snoring had definitely worsened with age and I was in a separate bedroom to my wife on most nights just to let her sleep. I’d tried inhalers and lavender oil, but nothing made a difference and most mornings I woke up absolutely shattered.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The exercises have definitely helped. I’m familiar with some of them as I do that kind of thing before going on stage. The results have been impressive. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before I started, I was snoring loudly for an hour, very loudly for two minutes and only regularly got two hours of ‘quiet’ sleep. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now I will typically snore loudly for 17 minutes, very loudly for less than a minute and enjoy more than six hours of quiet sleep. My wife says she can’t hear me as much and I’m getting much better quality of sleep.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>GIVE YOUR THROAT A DAILY WORKOUT</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For some years specialists in the U.S. have been studying the effectiveness of exercises in tightening and toning the throat muscles, and research shows near-miraculous results.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daily targeted exercises can reduce snoring volume by 60 percent and frequency by 39 per cent. That’s a far, far better result than you’d get from anything you might be able to pick up at the chemist.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the muscle-toning routines used in these American studies are complex and convoluted, requiring reams of instruction and 45 minutes of diligent daily practice. This, in my opinion, isn’t sustainable, no matter how much snoring blights your life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So I have distilled the essence of those elaborate plans to create a complete high-energy throat workout of nine simple exercises which everyone can quite quickly run through after brushing their teeth at night or every morning. I think of it as yoga for the mouth and recommend it to all my snoring patients, with great success.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-7d044a20-9a4a-11e7-bb28-a57ff696037e">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">How loud?</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Snoring can vary from 60-100 decibels, with the average volume equivalent to a vacuum cleaner and extreme cases matching the noise of a chainsaw or motorbike.</strong></p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many people will notice improvements even after the first night, but you’ll need to stick at it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It might take three months of daily practice to achieve top tone (and minimal snoring), but once there, dipping into the exercises every so often is usually enough to stop the throat from falling back into its former slack state.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I urge my patients to download one of many snoring apps available. Many, such as Snorelab, are free for the most basic function, which is perfectly adequate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once you have downloaded it on to your phone (or tablet) you place your device face down on the bedside table next to you before you go to sleep and it will record your snoring throughout the night.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Try using it before you start the exercises, to get a baseline reading, then use it again at intervals to monitor your progress.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Very quickly you should notice a reduction in the volume of your snoring as the tissues tighten, and ultimately a reduction in snoring frequency, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Adapted by LOUISE ATKINSON from Stop Snoring The Easy Way: And The Real Reasons You Need To, by Dr Mike Dilkes and Alexander Adams, published by Seven Dials, £12.99.

And it wasn’t until three months after the symptom appeared that Lisa discovered what was really wrong: she had breast cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although a lump in the breast is the most obvious and best known symptom of breast cancer, one in six women with this disease have symptoms other than a lump, according to a study of more than 2,000 women published in May in the journal Cancer Epidemiology.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These can include a swollen arm, breathlessness, weight loss or, as in Lisa’s case, back pain.</p><img id="i-479dd7417f5723a4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/09/04/19/43E7E61200000578-4851764-image-a-5_1504551190117.jpg" height="953" width="634" alt="Battle: For months the 46 year-old assumed she had lifted something incorrectly and caused minor damage to her muscles or, worse, her discs" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But because of a lack of awareness about such symptoms these women are more likely to wait three months or more before seeing their GP than those who find a lump, the University College London (UCL) researchers said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed the possibility of cancer only occurred to Lisa — and her GP — when she finally found a lump herself, on holiday with a friend in Lanzarote three months later in April 2014.</p><div class="mol-article-quote floatRHS health" id="mol-6dfc7630-91a6-11e7-b2e9-cd24bccfdd87">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"><strong> I hadn’t contemplated checking my breasts when my back was hurting</strong></div>                        <div class="mol-article-quote-attribution"><div>Lisa Harvey </div></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I hadn’t contemplated checking my breasts when my back was hurting,’ says Lisa, 46, who is married to Tim, 51, a sales director.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But I’d forgotten to pack the shower puff I wash with, so I had to use my hands.’ That’s how she came to find a pea-sized lump, on the underside of her right breast.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She went back to her doctor after her holiday and was immediately referred for tests that confirmed the cancer diagnosis. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thankfully, although the tumour was aggressive, it was still confined to the breast. One in eight women are diagnosed with breast cancer during their life and the symptom of back pain is typically associated with cancer that has spread to the bones.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Bones are the most common site of secondary breast cancer, and it tends to affect large bones such as the spine, ribs and shoulder blades,’ explains Emma Pennery, clinical director of the charity Breast Cancer Care.</p><img id="i-b479452cefde9fc8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/09/04/19/43E7E5F900000578-4851764-image-a-6_1504551196398.jpg" height="953" width="634" alt="Recovery: Later a lump appeared in her breast and, thankfully, it was confined to that area " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">A swollen arm, breathlessness and weight loss — some of the symptoms flagged up in the recent UCL study — also tend to be associated with breast cancer that’s spread (to the lymph nodes in the arm or lungs, for example). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However there are a number of reasons why back pain may occur with cancer confined to the breast too. ‘Sometimes the specific location of the cancer can trigger a symptom, such as pain, for example by pushing on a nerve,’ says Emma Pennery. ‘There’s also a recognised syndrome called referred pain, where pain is felt in a part of the body other than its source.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We don’t know exactly why this happens, but because cancer attaches to tissue and can pull down on it, and can intrude on blood vessels and nerves, that can sometimes lead to pain elsewhere in the body.’ General ill health, too, can be a trigger for back pain, explains Dr Martin Johnson, clinical lead for chronic pain for the Royal College of General Practitioners.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘If someone isn’t feeling well they become less mobile and start to slouch, causing back pain — your muscles get stiffer and can start to spasm.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s also possible that someone may have back pain and then find a breast lump, but the two events are not entirely connected.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One difficulty is that back pain ‘is one of the vaguest symptoms known to man’, says Dr Johnson. ‘Nearly everyone gets it at some point in their life and the vast majority of it is muscular.’</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-50b71070-91a7-11e7-b2e9-cd24bccfdd87">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">CAN DIET CAUSE BREAST CANCER?  </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Researchers estimate that we might be able to prevent as many as 9 out of every 100 cancer cases (9%) by changing our diets. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> Research also suggests that about 5 out of 100 cancers (5%) could be avoided by maintaining a healthy body weight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An overview study has reported that women had an increased risk of breast cancer if they had more fats in their diet after the menopause. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another study has shown that women who ate higher levels of saturated fats had double the risk of breast cancer compared to those eating the least. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">People who eat a lot of foods containing fish oils (marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) seem to have a lower breast cancer risk than people who only eat small amounts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> <strong>SOURCE: Cancer Research UK</strong> </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">For this reason, Breast Cancer Care does not list it as a key symptom of the disease. ‘As there are so many things that can cause back pain, from the very banal to the more serious, it could be misleading — you don’t want everyone with back pain to assume they have breast cancer,’ explains Emma Pennery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘That said, it’s important that if someone has a symptom that’s not going away and is difficult to explain — that is, there’s not obvious cause, such as having spent three hours digging in your allotment — then it’s sensible to see your GP.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other red flags that indicate there may be a more serious cause include pain that wakes you at night or that gets worse despite the patient taking painkillers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unfortunately there is a lack of awareness surrounding the less well-known symptoms — on the part of patients but also potentially among GPs, says Dr Anne Rigg, a consultant medical oncologist at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Hospital Trust in London.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for patients, she adds: ‘There is no doubt that when there is a lump, almost everyone knows that it might be cancer and they go and see a doctor quickly. When it’s a lesser known symptom people do tend to see a doctor much later.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By the time Lisa received her diagnosis she had prepared herself for the fact it might be cancer. ‘But when I broke it to my husband he looked as though he’d been punched in the face,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She had surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and tamoxifen, a hormone therapy drug, and says: ‘The worst thing was that the treatment put me into an early menopause — I’ve have hot flushes and joint pain as a result.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But the back pain subsided when I had surgery, and as far as I’m aware I’m free from cancer now.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">If you've got ovarian cysts, one thing to be sure of is that you're not alone. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ovarian cysts are common, with one in 10 of us having one at some stage of our lives that requires surgery. Ovarian cancer is relatively uncommon with only one in 1,000 ovarian cysts being cancer in a pre-menopausal woman and three in 1,000 in post-menopausal women.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ovaries are designed to produce eggs each month (if you're not on the pill). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These eggs develop from follicles in the ovary at about day eight of the cycle and grow to about two centimetres before ovulation occurs. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some follicles get even larger and become a simple cyst of about less than five centimetres. This is something which doctors generally don't regard as significant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Medical guidelines suggest these can either be ignored or your GP should send you for a scan in about 12 weeks (guidance says one year but understandably, most women and GPs would prefer not to wait that long).</p><img id="i-a4810628a7c867b6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/11/16/423A4F6A00000578-4685982-image-a-31_1499786339261.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="If you’ve got ovarian cysts, one thing to be sure of is that you’re not alone.

At least 60 per cent of such cysts will go away by themselves so there's no need to panic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If your cyst is less than five centimetres and complex then you need a blood test for tumour markers, called a CA125 test. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These are chemicals made by the cysts and other tissues and will alert the GP to the possibility of cancer if raised. If they are raised don't panic, the cysts can still be benign but you should be referred under what is termed a two-week wait. If the levels are normal then a routine referral is all that is required.</p><img id="i-ed6ce7f3db913858" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/11/16/423A4F4000000578-4685982-image-a-30_1499786322348.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The best way to test for a cyst is to be examined internally by ultrasound scan.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong><span class="mol-style-large">Always report sudden change </span></strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The main problem with ovarian cysts is that they rarely cause symptoms unless they twist, rupture or bleed into themselves – this is termed a 'cyst accident'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The woman usually complains of sudden onset severe pain. This is an emergency and should prompt either an examination by your GP or going to Accident and Emergency (or both).</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-911b1120-664b-11e7-9e0f-d3d04e35c732">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox">Ovarian cysts rarely cause symptoms unless they twist, rupture or bleed into themselves </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is a condition called 'polycystic ovaries' which should not be confused with ovarian cysts. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In polycystic ovaries numerous little follicles develop up to eight millimetres in diameter, they don't cause pain and do not rupture/twist or bleed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They can cause a lack of periods and should be managed by weight loss (if overweight) or medical treatment depending on the symptoms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong><span class="mol-style-large">What actions should the GP take?</span></strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong> 1. If the scan is normal but the CA125 level is normal or raised</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He/she should look carefully for other causes of your symptoms. If no other cause is found then nothing is required. But if your symptoms or their frequency gets worse, do return to your doctor.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. If the scan is abnormal:</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If it shows a simple cyst less than five centimetres it can be left alone. If the cyst is five to seven centimetres in diameter, you should repeat the scan after around 12 weeks (60 per cent will resolve). If the cyst is seven centimetres or more in diameter you need to be referred to a gynaecologist.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If your doctor identifies the cyst as 'complex' and you're post menopausal, he/she should do a CA125 test and then refer you to a gynaecologist. If you're pre-menopausal and the cyst is less than five centimetres he/she needs to repeat a scan after 12 weeks. If it's more than five centimetres, you will need an urgent CA125 test and referral within two weeks to gynaecology for further investigation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once you've been seen in hospital you will be offered surveillance (regular scanning and blood tests every four months for one year) or an operation. The type of operation offered depends on if the consultant believes your cysts to be benign or cancerous.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So the above shows that a cyst on your ovary is common, almost certainly benign and may go away without surgery.

The most common cause for this is dehydration, so increase fluid intake to make up for any lost through sweating.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2 YOU REALLY ARE STRESSED</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stress activates the body’s ‘fight-or-flight response’, a cascade of hormones released that raise blood pressure and heart rate, and change the circulation. These hormones also slow down the digestive system.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3 IT’S YOUR THYROID</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The thyroid gland, located in the neck, is responsible for producing hormones that control the metabolism. An underactive thyroid – hypothyroidism – leads to loss of appetite, tiredness, sensitivity to cold temperatures and weight gain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4 BLAME MEDICATION</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A number of prescription drugs can suppress appetite, including some anti-depressants and cancer treatments. If you are on medication and experience significant weight loss, see your doctor.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5 IT’S MORE THAN ‘THE BLUES’</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">People with depression often lose interest in food, so if you have experienced low mood for a longer period of time, as well as having lost your appetite, it is a sign that it may be something more than just being a bit sad. Speak to your GP, or get in touch with a specialist charity such as MIND.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>6 YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO GLUTEN</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Coeliac disease – an intolerance to gluten, which is a protein found in grains – often leads to diarrhoea, abdominal pain and indigestion, but can also result in a loss of appetite. If you fear you may be intolerant or sensitive, it is worth excluding gluten from your diet for a short period of time to see if the symptoms improve.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>7 YOU’VE PICKED UP A PARASITE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Giardiasis is a rare parasite infection of the digestive system which causes cramps, nausea, indigestion, fatigue and loss of appetite. Often first contracted from drinking contaminated water, it can spread from person to person.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>8 IT’S A BOWEL DISEASE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, cause inflammation of the gut. Symptoms include stomach cramps, diarrhoea, fatigue, anaemia and loss of appetite. Most sufferers first develop the diseases in early adulthood, and the cause of many is not yet known.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>9 NO ADRENALINE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Addison’s disease, also known as hypoadrenalism, is a rare illness that affects the adrenal glands, which are responsible for producing ‘stress’ hormones such as adrenaline. It is often confused with other illnesses that share the same symptoms: fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle weakness and increased thirst. Patients have to take hormone replacements for life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>10 IT COULD BE VIRAL</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Loss of appetite is one of the symptoms of hepatitis, a virus infection of the liver, along with abdominal pain, high fever, muscle and joint pain and jaundice. While hepatitis C is the most common type in the UK, it is usually spread only through blood contact. Hepatitis A and E, on the other hand, are spread through consuming contaminated food and drink. They are both more widespread outside Europe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>There are many reasons why you may not feel up to eating.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="health-ccox">Does general anaesthetic affect your memory? In the past eight years I have had six general anaesthetics and my memory is not as good as it once was. Or is my memory loss down to old age? I am 72.</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic"><strong><span class="health-ccox">Stuart Ballard, by email.</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You and many others will be reassured to hear that general anaesthetics are not a proven cause of long-term memory loss.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although there is much debate on the subject, there is no evidence that the drugs used in anaesthesia cause damage to the tissue of the brain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your concern is not unusual, however. It is a universal experience that after the age of about 50, people find their memory is not as sharp as it used to be. They tend to have particular trouble remembering names and recent events, such as what they had for lunch yesterday.</p><img id="i-a72e449df183e3e2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/19/23/4190248B00000578-0-image-a-1_1497910175718.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="There is no evidence that drugs used in anaesthesia cause damage to the tissue of the brain" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s a common issue that people see their GP about. Like you, they often voice anxieties about anaesthetic — after all, so many people in this age group will have had surgery or will be scheduled to have an operation — or they’re worried their memory has been affected by prescribed medication.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the background, there is the fear that dementia is on the horizon. Yet these sorts of memory difficulties can be a normal part of the ageing process: brain scans of elderly people suggest the brain shrinks with age.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is a matter of judgment and considerable expertise for doctors to differentiate between normal ageing and a condition known as mild cognitive impairment, an intermediate state between normal function and early dementia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The cornerstone of the evaluation is the medical consultation. This face-to-face examination gives the patient’s GP a sense of the extent of the problem and enables them to make comparisons with others of the same age.</p><img id="i-10985f467f63e490" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/19/23/4190249B00000578-0-image-a-9_1497910187212.jpg" height="424" width="634" alt="Many people voice their anxieties about anaesthetic to their GPs " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is one reason why it is so important to be seen by a doctor who knows you and has followed you over the years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are also screening tests available that GPs, neurologists and psychiatrists use, for instance a questionnaire called the mini-mental state examination. This includes questions about the date and time; it also tests the patient’s ability to recall a list of words, to do mental arithmetic and to spell a word backwards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the result of this test is abnormal it will be followed by more detailed neuro- psychological testing. This usually involves longer tests under the care of a clinical psychologist, who will use questionnaires to determine which areas of cognitive function are affected.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The patient may also undergo a CT or magnetic resonance brain imaging scan to check for cerebrovascular disease (where there are problems with blood supply to the brain — a possible cause of dementia) and other issues.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would be unwise of me to venture an opinion about your own situation, but from what you have told me it is worth having a conversation with your GP.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I must stress again, however, that general anaesthetic is unlikely to have been the cause.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"><span class="health-ccox">I had my gallbladder removed a year ago and now my wife needs hers removed. Is this normal? Or could there be something else going on in both of us that we should be tested for?</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic"><strong>Alan Daly, by email.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The gallbladder is a reservoir for storing bile — a fluid that helps with digestion — that has formed in the liver.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If it starts to malfunction (for reasons that are not fully understood), then small stones — usually made of cholesterol — can form inside it, potentially triggering symptoms such as pain in the abdomen and vague sensations such as bloating, heartburn, acidity and belching.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The diseased gallbladder can also become infected — known as acute cholecystitis.</p><img id="i-bbd50c4ed1f80f67" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/19/23/419024A900000578-0-image-a-10_1497910193410.jpg" height="637" width="634" alt="If the gall bladder starts to malfunction  then small stones can start to appear inside it " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Symptoms and infection are not inevitable, but once they do start to occur then the recommended treatment is to remove the gallbladder (known as cholecystectomy).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your body does not actually need a gallbladder, and after the operation the digestive system will adapt and function normally.Gallstone disease is common. Around 6 per cent of men and 9 per cent of women are thought to have gallstones, though only about 20 per cent of those with stones will develop symptoms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To answer your question we need to look at the risk factors for developing gallstone disease, and there are many of these.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Age is the major risk factor (stones usually develop in middle age). Being female is a risk factor, as is being pregnant or having been pregnant in the past, because oestrogen, the female sex hormone, alters the chemistry of the bile. For the same reason, taking oral contraceptives or HRT also increases the risk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Family history is a risk factor along with obesity, diabetes and cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and having a sedentary lifestyle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Given the frequency of this condition, and the numerous risk factors, the fact that both you and your wife have developed gallstones does not suggest either of you has a sinister underlying condition. Although you may lead similar lifestyles, it is basically a coincidence, and your respective risk factors will be somewhere in that long list. There is no reason to undergo any other investigations. </p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>By the way... The men who MUST have cancer tests </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing was introduced some 30 years ago, doctors were pleased at last to have a means of screening men for prostate cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most don’t have symptoms until the cancer has spread, so being able to identify — and therefore treat — it early seemed like the Holy Grail had been found.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it soon transpired that this test (which measures levels of a protein produced by the gland) was a false dawn.</p><img id="i-a9ef44d4cf5dab71" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/19/23/4190233600000578-0-image-a-11_1497910198376.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="It transpired that the tests for prostate cancer introduced 30 years ago were a false dawn " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Studies in subsequent years have cast a shadow over it, on account of the high false positive rate — more than 20 per cent of men with a raised PSA do not have prostate cancer at all (raised levels can also be a sign of an enlarged prostate, for example).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What’s more, although a positive test in some men does indicate cancer, a proportion of those tumours are so slow growing as to never be life-threatening. This can lead to a situation in which treatment is more disabling than the cancer itself — in other words, the test has led to over-diagnosis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Medical professionals are still divided about the effectiveness of PSA testing and the ratio of benefits versus harm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The best summary of the evidence is that for every 1,000 men who undergo screening several times each over ten or more years, one death from prostate cancer will be avoided.</p><img id="i-a1a956ac5afad9ec" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/19/23/4190232D00000578-0-image-a-12_1497910214020.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Screening must be structured to the risks of the individual and not simply a blanket edict" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But that is set against the many men who will be damaged by radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy and other cancer treatments, which carry the risk of urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or bowel problems.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, it now seems that the pendulum has swung too far the other way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As many as one in ten men who request PSA screening are turned down by their GPs, the charity Prostate Cancer UK reported last week. Yet we know that about one in eight men will get prostate cancer, rising to one in four men who have a family history of the disease (such as a brother or father who had it).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These are the very men who should be screened, along with those with family history of the faulty BRCA gene and black men (all these groups have a significantly higher risk).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What all this means is that doctors and patients must bear in mind what I so often bang on about on these pages: screening must be structured to the risks of the individual and not simply a blanket edict.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Care must be taken to go through the patient’s history so that doctor and patient can decide, together, whether to screen or not.

I’m now being treated to help me avoid another one’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like me, many of you might have received a similar mailing from Bluecrest, offering screening appointments in your area. These are typically held in hotels or conference centres. With over 1,700 such clinics across the UK, Bluecrest are one of a number of commercial organisations that market health screening.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For a basic screening (price £129), I was offered checks to assess my risk of heart disease and stroke, my liver and kidney function, energy, muscles and bones. I’d get a gout check, diabetes check, a full lipid profile (cholesterol etc) and a metabolism check.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If I took up the offer within 28 days, I’d have my body fat percentage measured for free, ditto height and weight, my ten-year heart disease risk and (because I’m over 50) lung function.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And for £70 extra, I’d get a full blood count. Bluecrest explained: ‘With blood disorders early detection is critical; many issues can be cured but treatment is required straight away.’</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I imagine that many people would think this was money very well spent. But is it?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the NHS was created in 1948, there was little concept of health screening, ie checking to unearth previously undetected conditions — a sort of stitch in time saves nine approach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fast forward 30 years to when I started out as a GP trainee in Barnes, West London. By then we were conducting smear tests and looking at cholesterol levels, blood pressure and smoking history as risk factors in heart disease, but there was little appetite for NHS health screening as we, too, were under the cosh financially.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet even back in 1972, Sir Richard Bayliss, physician to the Queen and the consultant under whom I trained, published an article in the British Medical Journal questioning screening.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His view was that the most important information comes from the conversation with the doctor, when a patient’s medical history, their family history and lifestyle help identify the genuine risk factors. Anything else — blood tests, X-rays, physical examination — is secondary.</p><img id="i-35f119e203fde402" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/12/23/415F80DF00000578-4597558-image-a-3_1497305765445.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Sceptical:  Back in 1972, Sir Richard Bayliss, physician to the Queen and the consultant under whom I trained, published an article in the British Medical Journal questioning screening" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even now, with technology such as MRI or CT scans, it is the conversation with the doctor that is important; and subsidiary to that, simple tests including weight, blood pressure and a physical examination.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So when I received my Bluecrest letter, my initial reaction was to ignore it — but I know some of my patients have received this mailing, or similar, and curiosity got the better of me, so I booked myself in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ‘clinic’ itself was in the basement of a seaside hotel in Lowestoft, Suffolk, the examination room a meeting room converted for the day with a few items of equipment, including a tray with blood taking kit and an electrocardiogram (ECG) machine to check heart activity. There were also scales similar to those you can buy on the High Street and a portable examination couch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The technician conducting the check-up had worked in the ambulance service as a trained driver, and although utterly professional, it seemed he was working according to a script — and that meant straight into the tests.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, I was astonished that there was no interest in my medical history, which meant Bluecrest had no idea I’d been a kidney donor, that I had undergone abdominal surgery for intestinal blockage, that I had a history of sarcoidosis (an inflammatory disorder mainly involving the lungs), or that I’d undergone eye surgery three times in the past year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This had implications for my tests. For instance, the steroids I took for a year could affect my blood sugar levels or blood pressure; the sarcoidosis caused 12kg weight loss (which affected my BMI, but more of that later).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nor was I asked about my family history or my occupation, which might be relevant in terms of risk factors for future disease. The screening tests themselves, dressed up to look very grand in the printed material, were so lightweight it was embarrassing for me as a medical practitioner.</p><img id="i-88611ce25e60c50b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/12/23/415F807A00000578-4597558-image-a-4_1497305769369.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Not thorough: Dr Scurr was astonished that there was no interest in his medical history" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was asked to remove my shoes and socks (I volunteered to take off my jacket, heavy with phone, keys, wallet and diary) and my height and weight were measured.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Electrical contacts were placed under my feet to calculate my body fat percentage. Bluecrest states proudly that they give you a free body fat percentage, height, weight and BMI calculations, but anyone can do all this at home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I then had to lie down and roll up a sleeve and trouser leg to have my blood pressure measured via cuffs applied to an arm and a leg — a pretty simplistic measure of the health of your arteries.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-f6ce9110-4fbf-11e7-a75b-dd5e4dae4a5c">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"><strong> I was astonished that there was no interest in my medical history, which meant Bluecrest had no idea I’d been a kidney donor, had undergone abdominal surgery or that I had a history of sarcoidosis</strong></div>                        <div class="mol-article-quote-attribution"><div>Dr Martin Scurr </div></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">My heart rhythm was checked by attaching an electrode to each of my four limbs. In GP practices we use 12-lead ECGs, with six leads on the chest, so the Bluecrest version is a bit pathetic really.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finally, a blood test was painlessly and efficiently obtained from my arm. I was excluded from the lung function test as the technician asked if there was any reason I shouldn’t blow hard into the tiny spirometer, and I explained I’d recently undergone eye surgery, so this test was postponed for six months. For an extra £49, I was offered a PSA blood test for prostate cancer which I declined. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As Good Health readers will know, it’s a controversial screening test because of the high risk of false positives; it can also lead to over-diagnosis and over-treatment. None of this was explained. And my view is that offering it requires careful counselling — well beyond this technician’s level of training I thought.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The screening took 30 minutes in all, and you’re meant to receive the full report of your results within 21 days. Mine arrived just one day short of the six-week mark — the kind of delay that might cause anxiety. (What could be amiss? Were Bluecrest obtaining further specialist opinions?)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The results themselves are presented with an introductory text about each, marked by a green, amber or red flag, followed by advice about what to do next.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The good news is that I don’t have gout, though I suspect I might have guessed this from the lack of symptoms. Also, I had no red flags (ie, results well outside the normal range). But I did have six amber flags that triggered recommendations either to see my GP or undergo a repeat test in six or 12 months.</p><img id="i-2c9a68f9b3fc673f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/12/23/414EBD1300000578-4597558-image-a-5_1497306825617.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Mass audience: Thousands are encouraged to buy into the private health screenings, which usually take place in packed conference centers " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, not one of those amber flags was worth a jot to an informed medical practitioner. All had to be seen in the context of my own history, weight and age — yet for the uninitiated, every one of those amber flags could be a reason for sleepless nights.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the ambers was for my kidney function, with abnormal levels of eGFR. My levels were between 60 to 80, denoting a mild reduction in kidney function — if I was a young adult, that is.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I called my colleague, a kidney specialist, who not only said my level was better than his, but that levels decline after the age of 60. He said a better test of kidney function is a urine test for protein — easy and cheap to do. So why no urine test in a Bluecrest screen?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another amber was for heart rhythm. It seems I had ‘a slight abnormality’, a so-called right bundle branch block, and again I was recommended to see my GP. However, I’ve had that variation all my adult life, first noted when I was a medical student: so it is normal for me, not an abnormality.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-336b13a0-4fc0-11e7-a75b-dd5e4dae4a5c">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> <span class="health-ccox"><strong>It is beyond doubt a screen such as this will raise the workload for overburdened GPs and prove unsettling for the worried well. My view is that these lightweight check-ups are a waste of money.</strong></span></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another amber was for my blood count, showing a platelet count (the blood cells that help clotting) at 148 thousand per cubic millimetre, just below the normal range of 150 to 400 thousand. Given that I am healthy, with no bleeding tendencies, no bruising and well in every respect, it can safely be ignored, like going 31 miles per hour in a 30 mile zone. Another example of how lab results must be compared with the patient’s history.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I had similar tiny increases in my total cholesterol and ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol levels: again not an issue in a man who is very lightweight with the blood pressure of an 18-year-old, but sufficient to gain another amber flag, so more for my GP to go through. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another amber flag was raised for my total iron binding capacity — a measure of the iron-carrying proteins in the blood. It was minimally below normal, other tests showed my iron itself was normal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More worry for the uninitiated, and another topic to take up GP time. My BMI was low, another amber flag but not surprising given my sarcoidosis. But the flag came with patronising advice about the need to maintain a healthy body weight. And to see my GP. Quite apart from whether health screening saves lives, it is beyond doubt a screen such as this will raise the workload for overburdened GPs and prove unsettling for the worried well. My view is that these lightweight check-ups are a waste of money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The important thing to protect your health is to stick to the following: take regular cardiovascular exercise, eat at least five items of fruit or vegetables daily, cut back on salt and sugar, avoid smoking, and stick to alcohol intake guidelines. And if you have symptoms, see your GP. Simple.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman for Bluecrest said the service ‘is about long-term prevention of illness’. ‘Rather than creating unnecessary work for GPs, our work aims to help reduce the financial burden on the NHS in treating long-term chronic conditions such as diabetes.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The company has recently taken steps to make recommendations more personal, he said, and has a 24-hour GP helpline for clients to discuss their results.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Dr Martin Scurr signed-up for a physical by Bluecrest Health - but was left shocked by his experience, which failed to even ask about his medical history.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Peter Lloyd</dc:creator><dc:modified>2017-06-13T08:47:07.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>The great health screen rip-off: Are personal MOTs worth it?</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2017-06-13T08:47:07.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4596276/Meet-Britain-s-longest-surviving-heart-transplant-patient.html" title="Britain's longest surviving heart transplant patient: Donor organ that's lasted 30 years is still going strong - but it was only meant to keep the father-of-two alive for a decade"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4595166/Woman-36-develops-dementia-car-accident.html" title="Woman, 36, develops dementia after horrific car accident and is unable to remember her wedding day or other precious memories"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4596868/Could-MARIJUANA-cure-menstrual-cramps.html" title="Could MARIJUANA cure menstrual cramps?

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>FOODS TO AVOID FOR A BODY LIKE KHLOE </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So we know what Kardashian IS eating – we'll be sure to stock up on fatty fish and fruit then. But we also wanted to know the types of food we need to make sure to avoid if we want to get a body like the second youngest Kardashian.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Dairy  </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While many people consider dairy to be a protein, the body will utilise it first as lactose, or milk sugar. Therefore, people who believe that they can get sufficient protein in their daily diet from eating dairy products are misinformed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead dairy as a food is phlegm and mucus producing – disruptive to digestion causing in most people bloating and gas… as well it is inflammatory and will elevate triglyceride levels and the risk of increased sugar sensitivities. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another important consideration is that nearly all adults have an inherent inability to utilise dairy products and are, therefore, lactose intolerant. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aside from possibly elevating cholesterol, a diet rich in dairy products, such as butter and cheese, is going to create digestive difficulties. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Asthmatics do not consume dairy because it is phlegm producing and will inhibit oxygen consumption/utilisation.</p><img id="i-6b5602b584a8d4f1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/07/15/41339D7600000578-0-image-a-13_1496846592729.jpg" height="874" width="634" alt="Red carpet ready: Khloe Kardashian's body transformation happened when she was dealing with a difficult divorce from her then-husband Lamar Odom. Intensive workouts with celeb trainer Gunnar Peterson helped her to craft a body she was proud. Pictured: Khloe at Cosmopolitan's 50th anniversary in 2015 " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Diet foods </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These foods are either low calorie, low fat, low sugar or a combination of those things. As manufactured foods, these items are generally more difficult to digest and can, through the reduction of calories, cause cravings for higher sugar or higher fat foods to compensate for daily energy needs. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The best diet foods are one ingredient foods that have not been tampered with like rice, yams, oatmeal, sweet potatoes, chicken, fish, lean steak, vegetables, and fruits. There are no better diet foods than those.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Soy </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Keep in mind that though there are amino acid groupings (and protein) in plant-based products like soy, it is still a bean which means it is starch or sugar first and foremost. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Additionally, soy is high in oestrogen and has been linked to numerous cancers primarily breast cancer in both men and women. Products high in oestrogens like wheat and soy are unfavourable choices especially for men.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Juice  </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Juice rapidly penetrates the blood stream causing an almost immediate rise in blood glucose and an insulin spike resulting in a rapid energy response and then within a number of minutes a loss of energy, lethargy and the risk of additional sugar cravings. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Freshly squeezed juices do have macro and micronutrient benefits, some are high in antioxidants and some are high in Vitamin C and have immune-boosting benefits. Juices are best consumed as a fresh squeezed or cold-pressed product. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Juices from concentrates have a low nutritional value and can be extremely caloric. Cold pressed juices should be consumed within 48 hours of manufacturing.</p><img id="i-a1e252c3d3f4c304" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/07/15/41339D8400000578-0-image-m-31_1496846796648.jpg" height="899" width="634" alt="Dr Goglia advises his clients to stay away from soy because it is high in oestrogen and has been linked to numerous cancers primarily breast cancer in both men and women" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Dried fruit </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dried fruit is a source of sugar and fiber, only with no additional water for transport. Dried fruit is highly caloric and easily spikes energy and insulin levels and then can just as quickly cause a substantial drop in energy and additional sugar cravings caused by the insulin spike. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dried fruit can be digestively disruptive, causing gas and bloating for many people with IBS. The better choice over dried fruit is fresh fruit with its naturally occurring water for more efficient sugar transport. As with all fruits, there can be micronutrient and antioxidant benefits but in the context of dried fruit it will come at a disruptive digestive cost.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Multi-ingredient foods like bread, muffins or bagels </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are inflammatory foods and can reduce metabolic efficiency and stimulate food sensitivities, like digestive gas and bloating and slow digestion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even many of the 'whole wheat grain' breads are coloured to look darker or healthier and the fibre used in them are insoluble fibers. Foods used daily should be one ingredient starches like potato, rice, yam, sweet potato, and oatmeal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Fizzy drinks and diet drinks </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ah, yes, the sugary satisfying and addictive taste of soda and even diet soda. Both should be grouped in the same category as they contain numerous adverse metabolic side effects. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A 20-ounce bottle of soda contains 16 teaspoons of sugar. After 6 months, daily consumption of sugary drinks will increase the fat deposits in a person's liver by 150 percent, a direct contributor to diabetes and heart disease. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Diet sodas are useless and do not promote weight loss. In fact, they adversely affect metabolism by de-regulating correct insulin response and carbohydrate management. The result can be nutritionally devastating as in many cases the use of diet soda stimulates unwanted sugar cravings.</p><img id="i-17586a3c6000d5c9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/07/15/4133997300000578-0-image-m-33_1496847259235.jpg" height="673" width="634" alt="The health expert also cautions against juice because it 'rapidly penetrates the blood stream, causing an almost immediate rise in blood glucose and an insulin spike'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHAT MISTAKES DO MOST OF US MAKE WHEN WE DIET? </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to the doctor, there are a number of mistakes that most of us make when we're trying to diet. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Number one? Reducing and restricting your calories. 'By restricting and drastically reducing your calories you're actually hurting your chances in the long run of losing and keeping the weight off.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Being too strict with calories can actually decrease your metabolism. As well as this Dr Goglia explained that we shouldn't rely on supplements over eating nutritious food and exercising.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another common mistake we're guilty of? Impatience. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'People expect results too quickly. You need to invest in the journey and lifestyle aspects of nutrition and exercise and the life lessons learned from the successes and obstacles along the way.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what can we take away from a talk with this celeb nutritionist? Stay hydrated. Eat plenty of fish and really invest yourself into your health journey.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">For this year's Coeliac Awareness Week, Healthista spoke to the director of the national charity, Norma McGough, who revealed the 12 symptoms of coeliac disease to never ignore.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Head to Instagram and you'll find over 14 million #glutenfree posts and that's no surprise when we realise that over 500,000 people in the UK alone are believed to suffer from coeliac disease without knowing it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition which means it develops when your body decides that healthy cells are foreign and so it sends antibodies out to 'protect' your body.</p><img id="i-221c3923a37751fc" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/08/14/4018557600000578-4484824-image-a-1_1494251224003.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder where gluten causes damage to the small intestine. There are 12 symptoms of the disease that could lead to diagnosis" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">When someone has coeliac disease, their body triggers an immune response to gluten entering their systems. During this process, antibodies are released that damage the lining of their gut and can cause a number of unpleasant symptoms, some of which are not even tummy-related.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-dacb68d0-33f4-11e7-b03d-99009cea3ca1">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">WHAT IS COELIAC DISEASE? </h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Coeliac disease is a genetic autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These attacks damage the villi, small finger-like projections that line the small intestine that promote nutrient absorption.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is estimated to affect one in 100 people worldwide. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One percent - or three million Americans - are living with coeliac disease.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are more than 200 symptoms of coeliac disease but the more common ones are:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The only treatment for the disease and  is a strict gluten-free diet. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Only foods and beverages with a gluten content less than 20 parts per million are allowed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> <span class="mol-style-italic">Source: Celiac Disease Foundation</span></p></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The problem with coeliac disease, explains Norma McGough, director of Coeliac UK, is that it often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">McGough explained: 'It's a common disease with a prevalence of about one in 100 in the UK but we've only got one-quarter of those people currently medically diagnosed.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This means that there are still around half a million people in the UK who have coeliac disease but don't know it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what does having this condition mean? According to McGough, coeliac disease can be hugely detrimental if left untreated, allowing a number of problems to develop. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said: 'It can result in children missing school, adults missing work and having days off for various reasons… there are links with depression and I think in terms of your ongoing health, coeliac disease can have a big impact on an individual's life.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it's not all bad. Unlike other autoimmune diseases, there is a simple treatment for coeliac disease that works – sticking to a gluten-free diet. 'Symptoms can be reversed by identifying what the problem is and treating it properly by cutting gluten entirely from the diet.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Coeliac disease is a problem that affects the gut and so we often associate the condition with gastrointestinal symptoms. However, the range of symptoms that coeliac disease is thought to cause is hugely varied. Here are some of the signs and symptoms to look out for.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1. Gastrointestinal problems </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Symptoms are very often gut-related,' said McGough. 'Nausea, diarrhoea, stomach pains and even constipation.' While these are the symptoms that most people associate with the condition, they often go misdiagnosed as IBS. Research has shown that 11 percent of the population globally have IBS but this diagnosis can lead coeliacs to live life untreated and as such their symptoms will not disappear.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">McGough revealed that one in four of those diagnosed with coeliac disease had been previously wrongly diagnosed with IBS. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. Skin rashes </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Or more specifically dermatitis herpetiformis, often referred to as 'DH', a skin condition linked to coeliac disease. 'It's an autoimmune condition and causes tiny little blisters to develop. They occur mostly on the elbows and knees but can be anywhere,' says McGough. Both itchy and stinging at the same time DH responds to a gluten-free diet often by clearing up. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Diagnosis of DH is confirmed by a simple skin biopsy test and if you're found positive you'll be referred to a gut specialist.</p><img id="i-ebad3e4e6bbf32d1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/08/14/4018555800000578-4484824-image-a-5_1494251275555.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Skin rashes may be a sign you suffer from coeliac disease. The blisters, mostly on the elbows and knees, are small and itchy. The rash responds to a gluten-free diet often by clearing up" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"> <strong>3. Tiredness </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'One of the problems with the under-diagnosis of coeliac disease is many of the symptoms are what you might class as every day and can be associated with other things.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tiredness is one example of this. Extreme fatigue can be a result of the other symptoms such as when your body isn't getting the right nutrients because of the reaction its having to gluten.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you find that you have extreme tiredness, Coeliac UK would recommend that you contact your GP so that they can test your blood and whether gluten is causing these issues.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4. Mouth ulcers </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While this is a symptom that might not spring to mind when we think of gut problems, mouth ulcers are a common symptom of coeliac disease. In fact, they're a common symptom of autoimmune problems such as coeliac disease because they indicate a generally rundown system. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The dietitian revealed that this is a symptom to be particularly aware of, especially if they're serious. 'I'm talking about mouth ulcers that have a particularly detrimental impact because the whole mouth is covered. They're particularly large and sore and it's an ongoing problem for coeliac undiagnosed, not just the odd mouth ulcer.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5. Anaemia and Vitamin B deficiencies </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Coeliac disease damages the lining of your gut which can mean your body doesn't properly absorb the vitamins and nutrients that it needs from the foods you eat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anaemia can occur when your body doesn't absorb the right amount of iron in particular, which can lead to anaemia. But while not everyone with anaemia will have coeliac disease, it can often be a key giveaway as can deficiencies in B vitamins. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While you would have to have a blood test to know whether or not you're anaemic, signs to look out for are tiredness, shortness of breath, paleness and a tingling along with a crawling feeling in the legs. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">McGough explained also that 'nutritional deficiencies such as those in iron and Vitamin B are due to gut damage which then results in malabsorption of nutrients from the food you eat.' </p><img id="i-d6b73a954714cbd7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/08/14/4018556100000578-4484824-image-a-3_1494251252070.jpg" height="461" width="634" alt="Deficiencies in Vitamin B can often be a giveaway to having the autoimmune disorder " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>6. Poor coordination and balance</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Neurological problems such as a condition called ataxia are another surprising symptom that your body simply can't do gluten. According to the NHS, ataxia is a term for a group of disorders that affect coordination, balance and speech and can result in problems with balance and walking, vision and even speaking and swallowing. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's an interesting area because neurological problems associated with coeliac disease highlight the wide range of manifestations and symptoms that can be triggered by gluten,' said McGough. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While of course not all neurological problems can be treated with a gluten-free diet, 'there is some evidence and work ongoing at the moment which shows that some individuals with problems like ataxia can be treated with a gluten-free diet if the problem is caught early enough. This is known as gluten ataxia.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>7. Weak bones and osteoporosis </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Osteoporosis is a condition that weakens bones making them fragile and more likely to break. It's a common condition that according to the NHS affects over three million people in the UK and more than 500,000 people in this country receive hospital treatment for fragility fractures. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While for many people osteoporosis is not related to coeliac disease it can be a long-term complication of the disease if it goes untreated, 'and yet once established on the gluten free diet and sticking strictly to it, that can make a huge difference to bone health and bone density,' McGough asserts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>8. Depression</strong> </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-20eff3d0-33f5-11e7-b03d-99009cea3ca1">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TREND OF GOING GLUTEN-FREE </h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">The number of Americans avoiding gluten tripled between 2009 and 2014,  figures revealed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the proportion of people with coeliac disease (which causes gluten intolerance) dropped over the same period.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It demonstrates the fierce influence marketing and diet trends have on eating habits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The last five years have seen a surge in claims that bread, pasta, rice, cake, and all other glutenous products are disastrous for your waistline, skin, and mood.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2009 0.5% of people ate gluten-free, in 2014 1.7% followed the diet But number of coeliac sufferers went from 0.7% to 0.58% at the same time </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eliminating all foods that contain gluten could be damaging for your health if you do not have an aversion or an intolerance.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to coeliac UK depression is another symptom of coeliac disease that it could be important not to ignore. While experts are still uncertain about the exact relation of depression and the autoimmune disease McGough said: 'If you're unwell physically but you can't put your finger on exactly what's wrong and you've been back and forth to the doctor and they haven't either then there is a potential for you to be feeling depressed.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But while there are many individual studies highlighting the risk of depression for coeliacs, McGough asserted that there is still a lot of work to be done, 'there is still no clear picture about why this is.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>9. Multiple miscarriages </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is a symptom that might shock some people, and again McGough stated that we are still not fully sure of the reasons for this association. 'It's certainly something that there should be awareness of,' said McGough, 'in the case of repeated miscarriages and problems with infertility that have been checked out then certainly it's worth screening for coeliac disease.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While the evidence base is limited, McGough explained that 'there are studies that indicate that in undiagnosed, untreated coeliac disease there is this link with infertility problems. Therefore it's certainly prudent to do a blood test for coeliac disease.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>10. Sudden weight loss </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You might wonder how sudden weight loss can occur from a life-long condition but McGough explained that much like some of the other symptoms this is related to the autoimmune nature of this condition. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While the disease can be triggered in childhood, certain symptoms may not manifest until adulthood. 'We used to think this was a disease of childhood and we didn't realise that people were going through their lives with undiagnosed coeliac disease… today the peak diagnosis age is around 50.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's possible that if you have undiagnosed coeliac disease and feel particularly stressed or had some other unrelated illness it might weaken your immune system and then exacerbate the symptoms.' This could result in more malabsorption of nutrients in your gut and result in unexpected weight loss.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>11. Hair loss </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Autoimmune diseases can result in the loss of hair. 'In undiagnosed coeliac, disease alopecia [the medical term for hair loss] might be something that occurs but it may just be patchy hair loss as opposed to significant loss.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While it isn't a symptom that is as typical as gut problems, mouth ulcers, anaemia and tiredness, it is listed as something to be aware of on Coeliac UK's website.</p><img id="i-feb83f957ac9c52a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/08/14/4018552C00000578-4484824-image-a-4_1494251260527.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Hair loss or even patches of hair loss is a rate symptom of coeliac disease. In recent years, gluten-free diets are rapidly increasing " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>12. Tooth damage </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Again this symptom is a little rarer than most and is typically identified in children. 'Tooth damage from undiagnosed coeliac disease a particular sort of discolouration and grooving of the enamel'. And while you might not be able to easily notice it in yourself it is something that your dentist would be able to identify.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Coeliac UK has had links trying to raise awareness of coeliac disease to healthcare professionals in order to try to address this,' said McGough.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What do I do if I think I have coeliac disease?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The most important piece of advice I can give you is not to change your diet and see if it makes a difference. You should go to your GP or doctor and have a test,' warns McGough. If you stop eating gluten and then go and have a test the results can come back false.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The screening test is the first step on the journey to diagnosis and you have to be on the gluten-containing diet when you have that test because otherwise, it's a complete waste of time.' Then to confirm your diagnosis you will be referred for an endoscopy which will determine whether or not you have the disease.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The gluten damages the lining of the gut and starts to cause the symptoms of coeliac disease and when you have an endoscopy a tiny, tiny piece of the lining of the gut will be sampled and then that can be analysed and the appearance of that can confirm diagnosis of coeliac disease.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This article was originally published by<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.healthista.com/symptoms-coeliac-disease-never-ignore/"> Healthista.com</a>  </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder where gluten causes damage to the small intestine.

Large letters suggest you are very outgoing and love a lot of attention. But it can also mean that you are pretending to have a lot of confidence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Looking at Trump's notes, most of the letters are written in uppercase - overtaking most of the page.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="health-ccox">NARROW SPACING</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Narrow spacing indicates people who can't stand to be alone.

In the notes, Trump's dots appear high above the actual letter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>HEAVY PRESSURE </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Handwriting with a heavy pressure, where the words appears dark, is an indicator of high levels of energy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is also a mark of someone who is good with commitment and taking things seriously.

According to US dietary specialist Dr Jonathan Aviv, the best way to banish your it for good is by changing your diet.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Most people's image of the typical acid reflux patient is an overweight, middle-aged man who's overdone it on burgers or pizza and is complaining of heartburn.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But as an ear, nose and throat doctor, I see patients every day who break the stereotypical mould — for acid damage afflicts people of all ages, including the very young. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, more than 7 million Britons suffer from it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it doesn't just manifest itself as heartburn or regurgitation. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These aren't even the most common symptoms — in my practice, most acid reflux patients are more likely to have throat-related complaints, such as a lump-like sensation that causes difficulty swallowing.</p><img id="i-90df70dafa45483" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/31/00/3CAD272D00000578-0-Most_acid_reflux_patients_are_more_likely_to_have_throat_related-a-41_1485821636973.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Most acid reflux patients are more likely to have throat-related complaints, such as a lump-like sensation that causes difficulty swallowing" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other common symptoms include a chronic cough (that persists longer than eight weeks), frequent throat-clearing, hoarseness and a sore throat. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Often, someone with these symptoms won't realise they have reflux because the oesophageal tissues have likely been exposed to acid for so long, they've been numbed to its effects.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These 'silent' symptoms mean the condition can be overlooked, which has its own risks: a growing number of people are now succumbing to oesophageal cancer — the most extreme manifestation of acid damage.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But why are so many of us plagued by acid reflux in the first place? The answer, I believe, lies in the food and drink we consume every day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Doctors used to be concerned about only the acid that came up from the stomach into the oesophagus — now we know the problem is also the acid from certain foods on their way down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These foods cause problems in two ways: they loosen the valve at the bottom of the oesophagus (the lower oesophageal sphincter), allowing the stomach contents and acid to rise up, or they directly irritate the oesophagus.</p><img id="i-ac604cef08180e16" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/31/00/3CAD2B5B00000578-0-Eating_late_at_night_can_cause_inflammation_or_put_pressure_on_t-a-42_1485821643510.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Eating late at night can cause inflammation or put pressure on the oesophageal valve, as well as lead to bloating and gassiness" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our lifestyles also play a part. Smoking, eating late at night, rushing our food and being overweight can cause inflammation or put pressure on the oesophageal valve (rushing our meals and eating late can lead to bloating and gassiness). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stress is also implicated, as it triggers the release of hormones that can increase production of gastric acid.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Based on my 27 years' experience treating patients with acid reflux, I've devised a plan to tackle this growing problem, which I set out in my new book, The Acid Watcher Diet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This plan has two stages: a 28-day 'healing' phase, where you avoid foods that trigger acid damage, such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, coffee, peppers, seed oils, chocolate and processed food generally, and choose instead those rich in compounds that help repair the damage, some of which are listed in the box below.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatLHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-be698ce0-e7a4-11e6-8b19-6f195a4c0382">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">DIRTY DOZEN FOODS YOU SHOULD AVOID</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">These are the foods and drinks you must eliminate in the first phase to create a digestive clean slate:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Fizzy drinks: </strong>Even sparkling water — though not acidic, its bubbles can rise from the stomach, carrying acid</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Coffee and tea</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Citrus fruit</strong>: Any with pH 4 or less, including lemon, lime and pineapple</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Tomato</strong>: This activates and releases pepsin — the enzyme that can eat away and damage throat tissue — but can be neutralised in the second phase</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Vinegar:</strong> All varieties activate pepsin</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Wine:</strong> It is very acidic, measuring from pH 2.9 to pH 3.9</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Caffeine</strong>: Be aware it’s in some painkillers</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Chocolate:</strong> This contains methylxanthine, which increases stomach acid production and is a carminative</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Alcohol: </strong>Vodka and tequila are allowed in the next phase</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Mint</strong>: A powerful carminative, whether as a herb, chewing gum or tea</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Raw onion:</strong> This is a carminative and also a fructan, which means it causes the intestines to absorb water, causing bloating</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Raw garlic:</strong> Also a carminative and a fructan.

This is when the real trouble begins. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once pepsin is planted in your oesophagus, it is activated each time you eat or drink something acidic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As you may recall from your school chemistry lessons, the pH scale runs from 1 to 14 — anything below pH 7 is considered acidic; everything above that is alkaline.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pepsin becomes most active in an environment with a pH level between 1 and 4.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If there are no food proteins for it to break down (as there are in the stomach), the activated pepsin will eat away at the throat and oesophagus, causing problems from inflammation and heartburn to Barrett's oesophagus — and possibly oesophageal cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What's especially worrying is that once pepsin gets into your gullet, it floats through the airways and can end up anywhere, including your lungs, where it can cause inflammation and conditions such as asthma and bronchitis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pepsin receptors have been found in the sinuses and middle ears in people with acid reflux. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The concern is that, if activated repeatedly, pepsin can spark inflammation throughout the body.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A key feature of the Acid Watcher diet is that it keeps pepsin in your stomach, where it belongs, and prevents the activation of it outside the stomach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>DITCH CANNED SOUP AND VEG</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The secret is not letting calories, carbohydrates or fat dictate whether a food is 'good' or 'bad': make choices based on a food's acidity or pH value. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A general rule is that the more processed a food, the more acidic it is, due to the chemicals used to preserve it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dietary acid is found in carbonated drinks (sweetened, fizzy drinks can have a pH of 2.5), commercially produced fruit juices and in products containing high-fructose corn syrup (a sweetener made using sulphuric acid), such as biscuits, cakes and ice cream.</p><img id="i-53513264e9d43d09" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/31/00/3CAD2D5E00000578-0-A_general_rule_is_that_the_more_processed_a_food_the_more_acidic-a-45_1485821651553.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="A general rule is that the more processed a food, the more acidic it is, due to the chemicals used to preserve it" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's even in canned soups and vegetables — especially if they've been pickled or fermented.

Eliminate acid triggers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2. Rein in your reflux-generating habits — quit smoking completely and cut out processed food. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">3. Avoid fried food — it loosens the oesophageal valve.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">4. Eat three meals, and two mini-meals, at regular intervals between 7am and 7.30pm. This ensures you don't overeat and allows the stomach three hours to digest before lying down, avoiding night-time reflux.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">5. Practise the rule of five: you can eat foods with a pH value of 5 and higher, while pH 4 foods can be introduced in the maintenance phase. These foods will help heal the damage to your oesophagus by keeping pepsin in check.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">6. Introduce more fibre into your diet — it keeps your digestion healthy, reducing reflux. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eat a daily minimum of 450g of vegetables above pH 5 (for example, five medium-sized carrots) — half of which should be raw — and a daily minimum of 225g raw fruit (a handful of cubed cantaloupe with a banana).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One meal a day should be vegetarian to maximise fibre intake.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">7. Drink only water.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">8. Avoid seed oils. These — rapeseed, sunflower, sesame oils — have a borderline pH, but are essentially acidic because their extraction process involves chemicals. Instead, use extra virgin olive oil.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other borderline foods are peppers, berries and honey, as these stimulate pepsin production. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">(However, berries are permitted in both phases of the diet if you balance them with an acid neutraliser, such as almond milk, in a smoothie for example. Similarly, honey can be eaten if combined with a nut butter.)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Spices such as chilli are also not recommended during the healing phase, as they can loosen the oesophageal valve.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHY SIT-UPS MAY BE A BAD IDEA</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Regular exercise helps to accelerate weight loss, reducing pressure on the oesophageal valve.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the type of exercise you do is important. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Heavy weight-lifting, sit-ups and crunches, excessive jumping (such as in high-impact aerobics), competitive cycling and advanced yoga should all be avoided, as these can encourage gastric acid to flow upwards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, gentle yoga can be beneficial because its emphasis on deep-breathing can help reduce stress hormones that increase acid production (but be careful with the 'downward dog' pose, where the head is positioned below the waist, as this may trigger symptoms).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Reflux-safe exercises include cycling on a stationary bike (or one that doesn't require you to crouch) and light weight training.</p><img id="i-a21d1589a4eb2316" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/31/00/3CAD2F2D00000578-0-Heavy_weight_lifting_sit_ups_and_crunches_excessive_jumping_comp-a-49_1485821661370.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Heavy weight-lifting, sit-ups and crunches, excessive jumping, competitive cycling and advanced yoga should all be avoided, as these can encourage gastric acid to flow upwards" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>CHOOSE TO BE ACID-FREE FOR LIFE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After 28 days, you should notice your reflux is much improved.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Next is the maintenance phase, where you can introduce foods with a pH of 4 or above — including red, yellow or green bell peppers, some varieties of apples and soft cheeses including feta and cottage cheese. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This phase should last for two weeks, after which you can eat normally again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If your symptoms return, or to protect yourself long-term, you can choose to stick to this stage for life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Dr Jonathan Aviv is the clinical director of the Voice and Swallowing Centre at ENT and Allergy Associates in New York. </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>He is also an ear, nose and throat professor at Icahn School of Medicine, New York.</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Adapted from The Acid Watcher Diet by Dr Jonathan Aviv, published by Hay House at £12.99.</strong> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Acid reflux affects millions worldwide, but many don't even know they have it.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Most of us are familiar with the idea of Dry January — giving up alcohol for the month, often in an attempt to make up for the excesses of the Christmas period.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It's a concept popular with medical experts, who are warning that Britain is in the grip of an <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="/news/alcohol/index.html">alcohol</a> epidemic. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">More than ten million Britons drink to harmful levels, regularly exceeding the recommended maximum of 14 units a week (a medium glass of wine is two units, as is a pint of beer), according to a report last month by Public Health England.</font></p><img id="i-d6be1bba62af06a5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/02/22/3BC98EC600000578-0-image-a-1_1483396213439.jpg" height="381" width="634" alt="We asked five brave people who all drink over the official limit — most would be classed as heavy drinkers — to give up alcohol for a month" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And nearly two million of us are thought to be heavy drinkers — defined for women as having more than 35 units (three-and-a-half bottles of wine) a week, or for men, more than 50.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Exceeding limits is easily done — for example, a large glass of wine can equal a third of a bottle — and drinking at this level can leave you with more than just a hangover.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Not only is alcohol high in calories, but heavy drinking contributes to high blood pressure and cholesterol — and probably increases blood sugar levels by making the hormone insulin less effective at processing sugars, raising the risk of Type 2 diabetes.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Plus as the liver breaks down alcohol, it produces toxins that damage cells, leading to inflammation and scarring.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Around 20 per cent of drinkers will develop liver problems that could ultimately prove fatal. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Alcohol also increases the risk of cancer, stroke, dementia and heart disease.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Such is the concern about the number of people with liver damage that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) last month proposed that all heavy drinkers should have a scan to screen for liver disease.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But it's not just the liver that suffers, so too can your sleep, says Professor Kevin Moore, a liver specialist at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Regular drinkers often have impaired sleep because they are more likely to snore or wake more frequently during the night as a consequence of their poor breathing, or because they need to use the bathroom, leaving them with poor concentration during the day,' he says.</font></p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-f949d890-d13f-11e6-b23f-277f2e562a83">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">IS YOUR DRINKING HABIT DAMAGING TO YOUR HEALTH? </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">NICE recently recommended liver scans such as a Fibroscan, which is available on the NHS, for women drinking more than 35 units and men who drink more than 50 units a week. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">If you drink heavily or have done so in the past and are worried, your GP may be able to refer you for assessment. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">A liver health check is also available privately at the Royal Free Hospital. </font></p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But is giving up alcohol for a month enough to undo this damage to your body? Experts believe so.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Our recent research on people drinking an average of 35 units a week has shown that going dry for just one month decreases liver stiffness [a sign of liver damage] by 10-15 per cent and leads to significant reductions in weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and insulin resistance,' says Professor Moore. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'So it is well worth it.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">To find out for ourselves, we asked five brave people who all drink over the official limit — most would be classed as heavy drinkers — to give up alcohol for a month.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">They then had their weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels checked, and underwent various other blood tests before and after their alcohol-free month.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Blood tests measuring levels of certain liver enzymes provide important information about how healthy the liver is,' says Professor Moore.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The volunteers also had an ultrasound scan of the liver, known as Fibroscan. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This involves 'flicking' the organ with a vibration sent through the skin to see how the liver responds.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'A wobbly liver (with a score of less than seven) is healthy, while a stiffer liver, with a higher score, is a sign of damage, inflammation and scarring,' he adds.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Here, we reveal our volunteers' surprising results.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>IT FIXED MY HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE </strong></font></p><img id="i-f45597df5a890848" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/02/23/3BC9755700000578-4082714-Gordon_Charlton_pictured_enjoys_a_couple_of_pints_of_beer_after_-a-2_1483398252693.jpg" height="459" width="306" alt="Gordon Charlton (pictured) enjoys a couple of pints of beer after leaving work, then a couple of glasses of wine at home.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘And researching my symptoms on the internet, it didn’t seem that they fitted the menopause, save for the night sweats.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Wendy, a sales manager from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, persisted and was eventually offered various tests including one to check her hormone levels, a cervical smear and blood tests.

I knew I wasn’t going mad. I hadn’t been in denial about going through the menopause.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">For months Christine Scott battled with inexplicable breathlessness. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">'I struggled to keep up with my family on walks and was breathless and wheezy when I climbed stairs, yet I wasn't a smoker and didn't have asthma,' says Christine, now 64.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">She assumed it couldn't be an animal allergy either, as the family had kept a pet cockatiel, Tweety, for many years.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But it turned out Christine did have a condition caused by her pet — the quaintly-termed 'bird fancier's lung' (BFL) — and it can also be triggered by duvets made of duck and goose down.</font></p><img id="i-ec30bbece8639ef3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/11/07/18/3A27D04300000578-0-Symptoms_of_hypersensitivity_pneumonitis_or_bird_fancier_s_lung_-a-2_1478543901407.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Symptoms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or bird fancier's lung, often go unnoticed for years because the changes are so subtle" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Aside from mild hay fever, I'd never had any breathing difficulty before and couldn't think what could be causing it,' says Christine, who lives in Brackley, Northamptonshire, with her husband Cyril, 65, a retired telecoms engineer. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'It was deeply worrying, but eventually I put it down to being overweight.' Christine, who is 5ft 6in, weighed 15st, although that weight gain pre-dated the wheeziness by years.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But after months of problematic breathing and embarrassed that she couldn't walk up stairs any more without stopping, Christine — who'd previously been reasonably fit and enjoyed walking — finally went to her GP.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He told her it was nothing to worry about and said she should rest. </font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Christine wasn't convinced and used private medical insurance to see a lung specialist. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">After tests, including an MRI, an X-ray, and a bronchoscopy (where a viewing tube was inserted via her nose and down her throat), she was told her lungs were scarred and inflamed.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'When the doctor said my breathing was so bad I had to stay in hospital, I couldn't believe it,' she says.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">After quizzing Christine about her lifestyle the consultant diagnosed an allergy to birds — specifically a protein found in their droppings and feathers.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'He prescribed steroids but said Tweety had to go, which was sad because he'd been a big part of our family for so

style="font-size:1.2em">Christine thought that if she avoided birds, she would recover.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But after a couple of years of improvement, in 2014 her condition suddenly began to worsen. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'I was breathless on the treadmill and cross-trainer at the gym before I even got started, and I was trailing behind my family on days out,' she says. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'I always had to take the lift rather than the stairs and I was wheezy at night, too.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Her GP referred her for more tests including a chest X-ray which showed significant deterioration in her lungs. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A biopsy revealed fibrosis (stiffening of the tissue) and scarring.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Christine's specialist explained that, although most people with bird allergies get better when they avoid them, her immune system was still reacting as if it was being exposed to Tweety's feathers and droppings even though the cockatoo hadn't lived with them for six years.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Her allergy had led to a condition called hypersensitivity pneumonitis — she had the most common form, bird fancier's lung.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Essentially an allergen causes the alveoli (the small sacs in the lungs) to become inflamed, causing changes to their structure and reducing their ability to move air in and out of the body, which is what causes breathing difficulties.</font></p><img id="i-f64824e7fc45b00b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/11/07/19/3A27F08300000578-0-image-a-26_1478546959742.jpg" height="1413" width="634" alt="Christine's allergy had led to a condition called hypersensitivity pneumonitis — she had the most common form, bird fancier’s lung" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Symptoms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis often go unnoticed for years because the changes are so subtle, explains Stephen Spiro, a professor of respiratory medicine at Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, and medical adviser to the British Lung Foundation. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The condition nibbles away at the lungs and causes them to stiffen over a long period.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'The amount of allergen (in this case avian proteins) needed to cause damage to the lungs is tiny and it happens so slowly, over so many years, that typically people aren't diagnosed until the disease is quite advanced,' he says.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'It usually stops or slows if the bird is removed from the patient's home, but the lungs may be so damaged from past exposure that the full extent of damage is not noticed until it disrupts breathing.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It's not clear why some people develop hypersensitivity and others don't, or why only some people develop serious lung disease because of it. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'In most people inflammation is short-lived and can be controlled by steroids and avoiding the allergen — however, sometimes the only treatment for extensive damage is a lung transplant.</font></p><img

by an undiagnosed allergy to her pet cockatiel 'Tweety'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Up to 20 per cent of pigeon breeders were found to have BFL in a recent study in Salt Lake City in the U.S., although doctors 'don't know why birds seem to cause more of a problem than other animals,' says Professor Spiro.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A similar condition — feather duvet lung — has also been diagnosed in people who have duvets filled with duck or goose down.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Tests showed that Christine's lung function was down to just 33 per cent. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'My specialist told me he was referring me for assessment for a lung transplant,' says Christine, who cried when she realised she had a life-threatening condition.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Doctors could treat the inflammation but couldn't do anything about the scarring, which was getting worse and meant I was vulnerable every time I had a chest infection.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Christine is on a waiting list for a lung transplant and in the mean time is hooked up to a constant supply of oxygen and on strong medication to try to stop any more damage (but which makes her more susceptible to infections for life).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'All of this is because we kept a cockatoo as a pet. I wish now I hadn't ignored my wheeziness and breathlessness for so long and explained them away by saying I was overweight and getting older.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Her story may be extreme but there are many, more common causes of chronic wheezing that shouldn't be ignored.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Wheeziness' is defined as a continuous, coarse whistling sound caused by turbulence in your air flow,' explains Dr James Hull, a consultant respiratory physician at Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'If you're wheezing, some part of the respiratory tract must be narrowed or obstructed, or the speed of air flow affected,' he says, adding that chronic wheeziness needs investigating.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Here we look at some of the most common causes . . .</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>WHEEZING WITH BREATHLESSNESS</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>Could be: Asthma</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The classic symptoms are recurrent attacks of wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing and chest tightness — which happen when the lining of the small airways become inflamed and swollen and the muscles around the airways constrict, reducing the flow of air and in and out of the lungs.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'As asthma is so common ( affecting 5.4 million in the UK) it is often assumed it must be the cause ( of wheezing),' says Dr Hull. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But asthma symptoms can be very similar to symptoms of other lung conditions, so patients need to ensure they're given the right tests to avoid being misdiagnosed.</font></p><img id="i-2237c9ae79957c26"

significant proportion of the patients I see at Royal Brompton, who have been initially diagnosed with asthma, will end up with a different diagnosis,' he adds.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'This is a key reason why NICE is testing the feasibility of a better way of performing diagnostic tests for asthma in general practice.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Tests include spirometry, which involves breathing in as fast as you can through a mouthpiece attached to a machine called a spirometer, which measures the amount of air you can hold in your lungs.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A 'peak flow monitor' can measure how fast you can blow out air from your lungs.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Treatments include daily steroid preventer inhalers to reduce inflammation in the lungs, and reliever inhalers which contain Beta2 agonists to widen the airways.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>BREATHLESSNESS AND A COUGH</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>Could be: Cardiac asthma</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'This isn't asthma at all but a symptom of heart failure,' explains Professor Spiro. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Heart failure is where the heart can't pump blood efficiently around the body — it often occurs following a heart attack and causes fluid to build up around the lungs.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As well as breathlessness with or without wheezing, patients suffer from a chronic cough and rapid shallow breathing. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A common sign is if these symptoms wake you up at night because when you are lying down, adds Professor Spiro.</font></p><img id="i-217c77f0fc91f002"

style="font-size:1.2em">'Blood that normally pools in the legs re-enters the bloodstream and those with heart failure can't cope with the increased volume — resulting in a fluid build-up inside the lungs which affects your ability to breathe.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'It's more common in older people who are most at risk of heart failure, and is usually diagnosed after a patient is admitted to hospital with breathing difficulties at night.' </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Treatments include medication to

IT’S AN INFECTION</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A sharp and sometimes burning pain in the ear is a common problem, and is often the result of an infection in the ear canal or behind the eardrum (the middle ear). </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Most infections clear up on their own, but if the pain persists for a few weeks, a GP may prescribe antibiotics.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>2. YOU’RE BLOCKED UP</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A build-up of mucus in the eustachian tube – the canal connecting the middle ear to the nose and throat – is known as glue ear. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The mucus puts pressure on the eardrum, causing dulled hearing and pain. Too much wax in the outer ear canal can cause similar symptoms.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>3. BLAME THE FLU</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Sinusitis, an infection in the air-filled cavities behind the nose and forehead, is normally caused by a cold or flu, and can also affect the ears. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Symptoms tend to clear up within a few weeks.</font></p><img id="i-60910dcbcd3a547f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/09/03/16/30AB5E2200000578-3772333-image-a-42_1472916788234.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="A sharp and sometimes burning pain in the ear is a common problem, and is often the result of an infection in the ear canal or behind the eardrum (the middle ear)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>4. IT’S ARTHRITIS</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Arthritis can affect the temporomandibular joints (TMJs), where the jawbone is attached to the skull. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As the TMJs are located in front of each ear, this causes pain in that area, which may spread to the cheek and temple.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>5. THE DAILY GRIND</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Grinding your teeth can affect your ears too, thanks to ‘referred pain’. The grinding puts stress on the TMJs. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">About six million Britons grind their teeth, most commonly between the ages of 25 and 44, and its is usually because of anxiety.</font></p><img id="i-a437d567a3063de5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/09/03/16/30C9CD9400000578-3772333-image-a-43_1472916791719.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Earache and a difficulty in swallowing indicates a throat infection, such as tonsillitis" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>6. UNDER PRESSURE</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Ear barotrauma, also known as airplane ear, is caused by altitude changes. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The air pressure inside and outside the body is normally the same, but when descending or ascending at speed – for example, during a flight – the inner ear does not have time to adjust, causing a blockage of the eustachian tube. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Chewing gum or yawning can help.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>7. COTTON BUD DAMAGE</strong></font></p><img id="i-8be2caa65fec69a2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/09/03/16/0B67506F00000578-3772333-image-a-41_1472916739252.jpg" height="461" width="306" alt="Cotton buds  can cause damage to the ear canal  if inserted too far" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Many people use cotton buds to clean their ears, but they can cause damage to the ear canal or even perforate the eardrum if inserted too far. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A pharmacist will be able to advise on suitable treatment for any build-up of wax.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>8. SPOT ON</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A spot in the outer ear canal can be very painful. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">However, do not try to clean the area or burst the boil using your fingers, as bacteria can travel from your nails or fingertips and cause an infection. Instead, alleviate the pain with a hot towel or painkillers.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>9. NERVE DAMAGE</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Damage to the trigeminal neuralgia – the main nerve in the face – can be caused by a fall or an accident. If the branch of the trigeminal nerve which has been damaged is in the cheek, this often results in pain in the ear.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>10. IT’S IN YOUR THROAT</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Earache and a difficulty in swallowing indicates a throat infection, such as tonsillitis. Antibiotics may be prescribed if the symptoms persist for several days or if they get worse.</font></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>From an infection in the ear canal to a build-up of mucus, having the flu, arthritis and using cotton buds - here are the ten reasons explaining why you suffer with earache.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Amie Gordon</dc:creator><dc:modified>2016-09-04T01:31:24.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>The ten reasons you get earache </mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2016-09-04T01:31:24.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3770514/I-bullied-went-bald-Nurse-dubbed-Dumbo-cruel-tormentors-says-stress-caused-hair-fall-out.html" title="'I was bullied until I went bald': Nurse dubbed 'Dumbo' by cruel tormentors says the stress caused ALL her hair to fall out"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3770590/Girl-3-sepsis-battle-left-traumatised-speak-stuns-parents-finally-says-love-mummy.html" title="Baby whose sepsis battle at just 13 weeks left her too traumatised to speak stuns her parents to finally say her first words 3 YEARS later"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3770247/Boy-receives-breast-implants-treat-illness-covers-moles.html" title="Four-year-old Atlanta boy undergoes 26 breast implant operations to treat rare illness that has seen his entire body covered in moles "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3769286/Being-hot-cold-pregnancy-increase-risk-premature-birth.html" title="How a heatwave can harm your baby: Being too hot or cold during pregnancy 'may increase the risk of premature birth'"></link></item><item><title>Horrific moment woman removes ENORMOUS cyst from her boyfriend’s face in graphic 10-minute video </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3767783/Horrific-moment-woman-removes-ENORMOUS-cyst-boyfriend-s-face-graphic-10-minute-video.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2016 20:05:52 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">3767783</guid><description><![CDATA[WARNING - GRAPHIC CONTENT: Unlike acne cysts, true cysts like this are treated by doctors and should never be handled at home.

The menopause is a common trigger, as the change in hormonal balance leads to drying of all mucous membranes.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>2 THE PROBLEM’S IN YOUR NOSE</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A lack of saliva leads to friction in the mouth when talking and eating, resulting in discomfort, ulcers and sores. Persistent ‘mouth breathing’ can be caused by a blocked nose as a result of a cold or hay fever.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It can also be caused by narrow or obstructed nasal airways, having an overbite which causes the lips to not close properly at night, or abnormally large tonsils.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>3 BLAME YOUR DECONGESTANT...</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Decongestant medications work by shrinking blood vessels in the mucous membranes, reducing inflammation and easing breathing. An indirect effect of this action is that less fluid from the circulation gets into the nasal cavity – so decongestants do ‘dry you up’. In the short term this is a relief, but when used long-term, this effect can cause an uncomfortably dry nose and mouth.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>4 ...OR YOUR MOUTHWASH</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Mouthwashes that contain alcohol are double-edged swords, because though they kill harmful bacteria in the mouth, they can cause dryness. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This is because the alcohol in the mouthwash irritates the mouth’s mucous membranes and dehydrates them. </font></p><img id="i-262053fd79112dd0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/13/16/1CCF250F00000578-3738869-image-a-3_1471101302152.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Mouthwashes that contain alcohol are double-edged swords, because though they kill harmful bacteria in the mouth, they can cause dryness" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Saliva is the mouth’s natural ‘cleanser’ and protects against tooth decay and gum disease, so a dry mouth is a risk factor for both. Avoid this by choosing a non-alcohol based mouthwash.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>5 ACID REFLUX</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A dry mouth is a less common side effect of gastroesophageal reflux disease – sometimes called heartburn. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">When stomach acid travels up the oesophagus to the throat, this causes irritation and inflammation that can dry out the throat and mouth, prompting increased swallowing of saliva to lubricate the throat and alleviate the dryness.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>6 TOO MUCH COFFEE</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">High consumption of caffeinated drinks can lead to dehydration. Caffeine is a mild diuretic, meaning that it makes you urinate more frequently. In addition, tannins – a naturally occurring plant compound found in coffee and several types of tea – cause a dry sensation in the mouth.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>7 BLAME DIABETES</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Consistent high blood sugar levels caused by untreated diabetes can lead to dry mouth. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As well as tiredness and weight loss, symptoms of hyperglycaemia include a more frequent need to urinate. </font></p><img id="i-f32cd4a5dd7baf82" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/13/16/221597EF00000578-3738869-image-m-5_1471101338902.jpg" height="464" width="634" alt="Consistent high blood sugar levels caused by untreated diabetes can lead to dry mouth" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">When there is a high concentration of glucose in the blood, the kidneys lose capacity to reabsorb fluid, instead flushing it out as urine, dehydrating the body. Dry mouth can also be caused by diabetes medication.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>8 IT’S YOUR JOINTS</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or vasculitis – inflammation of the blood vessels – can cause secondary Sjögren’s syndrome, a condition in which the immune system attacks the body’s tear and saliva glands, causing dry mouth and eyes. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Nine out of ten sufferers are women and it commonly appears in late middle age.

That's aside from the pelvic pain and skin break-outs. It is tempting as some stages in your cycle to drop all your good intentions and just bury yourself in a sofa with pizza. But there is a healthy way to work with your body to stay vibrant, trim, and nourished - while giving yourself a break when you need it.

This two-pronged investigation would double check whether I had acid reflux and also help detect other problems that could be masquerading as it.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Part one took 45 minutes. It involved sitting upright while a thin wire containing pressure sensors was passed through my nose, down my throat (numbed with anaesthetic) and into my stomach.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Then I was fed water and bread to make me swallow, so that the contractions of my gullet would press on the sensors.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Poor contractions can indicate achalasia — one of the four problems that can pass for reflux. Achalasia is where the gullet loses its ability to move food along due to a problem with nerves in its wall. ‘This causes food, saliva and oesophageal juices to build up causing irritation,’ explains Mr Reddy.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The pressure-sensor test also checks whether the valve into the stomach is working. With acid reflux, this valve opens too often. But sometimes the opposite happens and the valve does not open enough, so that food fails to descend into the stomach as it should.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This may be related to achalasia or, rarely, growths. Ironically, it can also be caused by previous reflux, because this can cause tissues around the valve to thicken — known as a stricture — preventing the valve opening properly.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Whatever the cause, the consequence is an irritating build-up of food in the throat.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The first tube was then removed and, for part two, a thinner one was inserted via my nose where it would remain for 24 hours. Thankfully, I was only conscious of it when I swallowed. I was sent home so it could monitor my stomach and throat.</font></p><img id="i-c6602479a8424d66" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/01/22/36C8ECCD00000578-3718535-Acid_reflux_can_be_a_life_altering_condition_as_many_sufferers_h-a-23_1470088038123.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Acid reflux can be a life-altering condition, as many sufferers have to change their lifestyles" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Its purpose was to check the acidity in my stomach, and whether acid was reaching my throat.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If everything is normal on the acid front, it can indicate the third problem that may cause reflux symptoms: bile acid.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Because of a faulty muscle and valve bile acid can escape from the duodenum into the stomach and into the oseophagus.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Bile acid is actually alkaline and so acid suppressing drugs won’t act on it — but it’s very corrosive to the oesophagus,’ says Mr Reddy.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And if these two tests were negative, I might have the fourth potential cause of symptoms — slow gastric motility, where the stomach empties too slowly, causing pressure to build and force open the stomach valve, so its contents spill upwards.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">My investigation revealed a problem with the valve going into my stomach — it wasn’t that acid was splashing up, but food wasn’t going down properly, so some was sticking in my oesophagus.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>Many people suffer from occasional acid reflux, but for some it becomes a chronic problem that can lead to ulcers and potentially cancer. </strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>Matthew Foster, 28, a Royal Engineer who lives near Ripon, North Yorkshire, underwent a new NHS procedure, as </strong><strong>he tells CAROL DAVIS.</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong><span class="health-ccox mol-style-large">THE PATIENT </span></strong></font><br /><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">All my life I’ve kept pretty fit, eaten healthily and had no health worries. But around five years ago I started having a painful burning feeling in my throat after I’d been hurtling around the rugby field, or if I’d been for a jog.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I knew it was heartburn, though didn’t think much could be done so I just bought over-the-counter remedies — Gaviscon liquid helped, and so did Rennie tablets, which I’d take after food or exercise.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But I was gradually having to take more and more — in just one day I’d get through a packet of Rennies and a whole bottle of Gaviscon.</font></p><img id="i-bb23f37096afbb44" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/18/21/36103E8100000578-3696002-image-m-2_1468873931161.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Matthew  suffered from chronic heartburn, presumably due to a small hernia, and underwent the new procedure" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If I went for a pint with my mates I’d have to take a sip of Gaviscon before going out, and then again as soon as I got back to stop the painful burning.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Two years ago — around three years after the problem first started — I went to my GP, who confirmed that it was acid reflux causing my symptoms.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He explained that acidic juices from my stomach were rising up into my throat because the valve separating the gullet and stomach was too weak to keep them down.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He suspected that this had been partly caused by a small hiatus hernia he said I had — basically part of my stomach was being squeezed, pushing the stomach contents up the gullet.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I was prescribed lansoprazole, which reduces the amount of acid your stomach produces, and referred to the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough for more tests.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Two months later I had an endoscopy — where they put a flexible tube with a camera on the end down your throat — and a special X-ray called a barium swallow to see where the stomach acid was in my gullet. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">These confirmed I had a hiatus hernia and acid reflux which needed treatment with surgery.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The doctors told me they could operate to wrap part of my stomach around the bottom of the gullet — this would strengthen the valve and stop acid washing back up.</font></p><img id="i-3523c4c8b2890154" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/18/21/36103E9A00000578-3696002-Today_Matthew_can_eat_and_drink_what_he_wants_without_having_to_-a-7_1468874224818.jpg" height="350" width="306" alt="Today Matthew can eat and drink what he wants without having to take medication" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But that sounded like a major operation, and I really didn’t want that. So I went on taking the lansoprazole daily. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I even tried avoiding things that made it worse, such as pastry and lager.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It wasn’t enough though, and the heartburn got unbearable. After training I’d be sick as acid washed back up my throat — exercise clearly put extra strain on my stomach.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I also didn’t like the idea of being on pills for life, so I got referred back to the James Cook. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This time I saw Dr Y.K.S. Viswanath, who said they was a new procedure to end acid reflux without surgery.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It involves putting a tube with electrodes at the end down my throat and onto the faulty valve.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The electrodes fire radiofrequency waves at the valve to strengthen it and help it close properly.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I had the hour-long procedure in April this year, under local anaesthetic.

Lifestyle changes, for instance avoiding caffeine and citrus fruit (which can increase the amount of stomach acid) can help.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Antacids such as Gaviscon, which coats the stomach lining to stop acid rising, are also worth trying, or doctors can prescribe drugs to reduce stomach acid, which patients usually have to take for life.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">When these fail, we can offer surgery. Conventionally this means a keyhole procedure to wrap part of the stomach around the gullet, which strengthens the valve.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But not all patients are suitable for or want surgery, so a newer option, called Stretta, is better.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It has been approved for use in the NHS and is now available at two NHS trusts (at South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and the Royal Liverpool And Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust) as well as privately.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It involves passing a catheter, a tube which is roughly 16-18 mm in diameter, down the throat.

Months later, she was diagnosed with medullary thyroid cancer and Jake flew back from Sydney where she was living to be by her side. Within weeks, she was told her body was riddled with cancer and it was incurable - meaning she had just a 20 per cent chance of living for another five years. The pair began fertility treatment immediately so they could have a baby via a surrogate in future. Now, Emmy has started chemotherapy (right inset) and is hopeful for the future. Wanting to raise awareness to this deadly disease - and raise money for the Royal Marsden hospital where she was treated - she plans to cycle 1,200 miles from London to Copenhagen on a tandem (left inset) with Jake. And despite her bleak prognosis, she remains resolutely positive. She told MailOnline: 'I'm genuinely so happy Jake and I are back together - I forget I have cancer. Love truly is the best drug and I have been totally smothered in it.'</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Anna Hodgekiss</dc:creator><dc:modified>2016-06-01T11:19:28.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>'At 13 years old he told me he was my lobster'</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2016-06-01T11:19:28.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Cancer (Old)</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3619460/Mother-drank-20-cans-Red-Bull-DAY-damaged-liver-badly-doctors-thought-alcoholic.html" title="Mother who drank 20 cans of Red Bull A DAY damaged her liver so badly doctors thought she was an alcoholic"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3619417/Woman-17-STONE-legs-speaks-joy-finally-shrinking-time-40-years.html" title="Woman with 17 STONE legs speaks of her joy that they're finally shrinking for the first time in 40 years"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3618213/Star-Trek-style-visor-help-blind-begins-trials-European-patients.html" title="Star Trek-style visor that could help the blind see begins trials in European patients"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3617757/Why-women-today-obsessed-labias-Leading-gynaecologist-reveals-3-main-reasons.html" title="Why ARE women today so obsessed with their labia?

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>The NHS is expected to pay out a staggering £1.4 billion for clinical negligence claims this year. And where will that money go? Well, some goes to patients and their families who have suffered harm or distress. But about a third is paid to the legal profession, and most of that goes straight into the pockets of patients’ lawyers.</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>Having spent 25 years as a medical expert advising patients, doctors and hospital trusts on clinical claims, I see patients going down the stressful, expensive and often futile legal route when their complaint could have been resolved at a much earlier stage.</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>I know of a relatively straightforward case where damages of £30,000 were dwarfed by legal fees of hundreds of thousands of pounds. The money settled the matter, but I don’t think the patient himself felt he had the answers, or the heartfelt apology, he was after.</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>I think one of the reasons people end up being channelled into the clutches of ambulance-chasing lawyers is the often bewildering NHS complaints system, at times a frustratingly slow and impersonal process. But in almost all cases, you can air grievances, and resolve disputes, quickly, with the minimum amount of fuss, without paying a penny – and here’s how...</strong></font></p><img id="i-7d34feaaca967dbb" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/04/09/16/3300014B00000578-0-image-m-2_1460216116833.jpg" height="577" width="634" alt="The NHS is expected to pay out a staggering £1.4 billion for clinical negligence claims this year. File image" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><font style="font-size:1.2em">WHAT CAN I COMPLAIN ABOUT?</font></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Anything you are unhappy about. Of the 4,159 investigations completed by the Parliamentary Health Service Ombudsman in 2014-15, 30 per cent were to do with diagnosis, including delays or misdiagnosis. Other complaints included staff attitude, and communication and information issues, including confidentiality.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Under the NHS constitution, patients have the right to have complaints dealt with efficiently, properly investigated and resolved, and receive compensation if it is found they have been harmed.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I’ve been involved with more than 8,000 medical legal cases on both sides and people complain for a whole range of reasons. Maybe their expectations were not achieved and they’ve suffered financial loss as a result – such as the man who was told he’d be back at work days after a hernia operation but who was still at home three weeks later.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Perhaps you feel you’ve been unfairly treated by your GP, or you just have a niggling sense that not everything went according to plan during your treatment and you want to know why. Or you could be in hospital, and find the environment or staff aren’t up to scratch.</font></p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><font style="font-size:1.2em">FIRST STEP: TRY TO NIP THINGS IN THE BUD</font></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In my experience, many problems that spiral out of control could have been tackled sooner. You may have been kept waiting a long time for your hospital appointment, or a member of staff was rude to you. Perhaps you felt an elderly relative wasn’t getting adequate pain relief, or even enough to drink. In these circumstances, do as you would in any restaurant when you aren’t happy: ask to speak to a manager.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Of course, this isn’t always easy. You may be feeling frustrated or anxious (or just too unwell!). Maybe you don’t want to feel like a nuisance or you’re worried your care will suffer if you say something. But if something is really bothering you, don’t be afraid to speak up.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Jot your concern down on a bit of paper, and how you want it put right. Be calm. Approach a member of staff, explain your problem briefly and ask to see someone senior. Most doctors and nurses are generally compassionate people and trained in dealing with patients, so they should be willing to listen to your complaint. It’s much more satisfying to receive an explanation from a member of staff who already knows you than a faceless person at the end of a phone.</font></p><img id="i-ed74dd77d4796be" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/04/09/16/1CE3566600000578-0-image-a-4_1460216461030.jpg" height="443" width="634" alt="Of the 4,159 investigations completed by the Parliamentary Health Service Ombudsman in 2014-15, 30 per cent were to do with diagnosis, including delays or misdiagnosis. File image" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><font style="font-size:1.2em">STILL UNHAPPY? THEN PUT IT IN WRITING</font></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you feel your initial complaint is handled unsatisfactorily, you can start to go down the formal NHS complaints process (but see your GP if there is something acutely wrong medically).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Every NHS organisation has its own complaints process. You usually need to put your complaint in an email or a letter to the service provider. If it’s about your GP, you can complain to the surgery directly or, if you feel uncomfortable doing this, contact NHS England (0300 311 2233, or email england.contactus@nhs.net).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For hospital-related complaints, hospital trusts usually have a complaints manager you can write to, or address your letter to the trust’s chief executive. Check the complaints section of the hospital trust’s website for who to contact.</font></p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><font style="font-size:1.2em">FEELING LOST FOR WORDS?</font></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Complaints can be daunting, especially if writing letters isn’t your forte. My advice is keep it simple. Focus on the key issues. If your main concern is that you feel you were given the wrong treatment, just mention this, rather than also complaining about the state of the toilets on the ward.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Make it clear what you want to happen – whether it’s an explanation, an apology, a change to the system or compensation, for example.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Of course no one expects you to have kept copious notes when you had, say, a hip replacement, but try to include any details of dates, times and names you may have.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Have a friend or family member read your letter before sending it off. Get a file together with copies of any correspondence.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You can get free advice about putting your complaint together. Most hospitals have a Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) who offer confidential advice on health-related matters to patients, families and carers. Search for PALS on the trust website for more details.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The Citizens Advice Bureau can help, and it has a very detailed webpage on NHS complaints (citizens advice.org.uk). Your local branch of consumer organisation Healthwatch (healthwatch.co.uk) will also offer free advice.</font></p><img id="i-33ce9081cc6afe01" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/04/09/16/29C71ACF00000578-0-image-a-5_1460216466726.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="Many problems that spiral out of control could have been tackled sooner.

File image" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><font style="font-size:1.2em">YOU’RE TOLD YOUR ISSUE IS HISTORIC</font></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You may be told you only have 12 months to submit a complaint, which is the official NHS line. Don’t let that put you off.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Some problems may not become apparent for months or even years after the event, or it can take time for it to dawn on you that not all is as it should be. Time limits can be extended, for example if you were grieving or undergoing trauma.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Having said this, the earlier you can complain, the easier you may find it.</font></p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><font style="font-size:1.2em">CAN I ASK TO SEE MY MEDICAL RECORDS?</font></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Yes, and you might find it helpful. Records contain letters, charts, correspondence, outpatient and inpatient clinical notes and so on.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Under the Data Protection Act, you have a legal right to apply for access to information held about you. It’s known as a Subject Access Request and includes your NHS or private health records held by a GP, dentist, optician or hospital.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Apply via email or in writing to the relevant place – your GP surgery, optician, dentist or your hospital trust’s health records manager or patient service manager.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Your hospital website should have contact details. Most organisations have a standard Subject Access Request form that you can fill in online.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Requests for access should be met within 40 days, but be aware that you may be charged up to £50.</font></p><img id="i-7f22c1704051537a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/04/09/16/1AFDA137000005DC-0-image-a-8_1460216670836.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="Hospital complaints must be acknowledged by the complaints manager or similar within three working days verbally, or in writing. Once it has been received, you should be offered a meeting. File image" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><font style="font-size:1.2em">WHAT HAPPENS THEN?</font></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Hospital complaints must be acknowledged by the complaints manager or similar within three working days verbally, or in writing.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Once your complaint has been received, you should be offered a meeting to discuss it and give you an idea of the likely timescales involved.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Unfortunately there are no limits on how long they can take to deal with your complaint, and it can depend on factors such as how many staff they need to speak to and how easy it is to access your medical records. But be persistent. If you’ve been waiting for more than six months for it to be resolved, you can report it to the independent Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (ombudsman.org.uk).</font></p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><font style="font-size:1.2em">FACE TO FACE IS BEST</font></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Always take up the offer of a face-to-face meeting, and ask that it includes staff involved in your care – nurse, doctor, consultant.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Again, prepare some notes in advance to keep your focus. Keep to the key reasons why you have a complaint and what you want to achieve.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Have a list of questions ready. For example, if you feel you have suffered harm or distress following an operation, ask:</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A health professional worth their salt will be able to explain things clearly to you, and if you don’t understand, ask them to repeat it.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You may find it helpful to have a friend accompany you to take notes, and for moral support.</font></p><img id="i-b60e800902fb2fe4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/04/09/16/32C5FCFA00000578-0-image-a-6_1460216477502.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Always take up the offer of a face-to-face meeting, and ask that it includes staff involved in your care ¿ nurse, doctor, consultant. File image" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><font style="font-size:1.2em">WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?</font></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You should be given a timescale at the meeting of when to expect your complaint to be resolved. At the end of the investigation, the complaints manager will send you a written response explaining how the complaint was handled, an explanation or apology if appropriate and any compensation offered.</font></p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><font style="font-size:1.2em">YOU’RE NOT HAPPY WITH THE OUTCOME</font></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you haven’t received a decision six months after your complaint or are unhappy with the outcome, you can contact the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The ombudsman will need details of your complaint, when it happened, how it affected you and what you want them to do to put it right.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The ombudsman can make recommendations to the organisation and can ask it to make a payment to you. While free of charge, this option could take up to a year and in my opinion the decisions can be variable.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I’d advise instead to try mediation, a grossly underused method that is effective, less stressful and a hell of a lot cheaper than going to court. Mediation is a relatively new concept in the NHS and takes the form of an independent, voluntary and confidential meeting in which a trained neutral sits with patients and NHS staff to allow both sides to outline their position, and see if common ground can be established and if issues can be narrowed and an agreement reached.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">About three-quarters of mediations result in a satisfactory outcome, often within a day, but mediation is not legally binding until a written agreement is signed and the case can proceed to court. The NHS Litigation Authority launched a mediation service in 2014 for cases that have reached the compensation stage (contact the trust involved directly for more information). The Tutu Foundation also offers a mediation service (tutufoundationuk.org, tel 01865 514830).</font></p><img id="i-a2ba267a1a17158f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/04/09/16/1B13B93A00000578-0-image-a-7_1460216485216.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="If you haven¿t received a decision six months after your complaint or are unhappy with the outcome, you can contact the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. File image" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><font style="font-size:1.2em">ANYONE ELSE THAT WILL BE ON MY SIDE?</font></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Every doctor and nurse has a legal duty to provide a good standard of care. If you feel they have fallen short, you can report them to their regulatory body. For doctors, this is the General Medical Council (gmc-uk.org), or the Nursing and Midwifery Council (nmc.org.uk) for nurses. These bodies can investigate serious mistakes in clinical care, dishonesty or abuse of position, but can’t make a doctor or nurse apologise to you, impose a fine or help you with a compensation claim.</font></p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><font style="font-size:1.2em">IF ALL ELSE FAILS… GET OFF TO A LAWYER</font></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If mediation fails and you feel you deserve compensation, you can seek legal advice. You have three years from when the incident occurred to bring about a claim. First, contact a solicitor who will assess whether you have grounds for a claim.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And remember, legal aid isn’t usually available for cases of clinical negligence and they are often complicated. The process can be stressful, lengthy – I’ve been involved with cases lasting four years – and the outcome is uncertain.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"> </font></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The NHS is expected to pay out a staggering £1.4 billion for clinical negligence claims this year.

This is contrary to the prevailing wisdom, probably peddled by older men, that they last longer, Dr Zietsch said (file photo)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As an evolutionary researcher, all this talk of how long sex lasts make me wonder: 'Why does it last any time at all?'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">All sex really needs to achieve, it seems, is to put sperm into the vagina. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Why all the thrusting and bumping? Instead of sliding the penis in and out many hundreds of times per sexual session, why not just put it in once, ejaculate, and then go have a lemonade and get on with the rest of the day?</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Before you say, 'because it's fun to go in and out', remember evolution doesn't care about fun per se – it generally only 'designs' things to be enjoyable if they helped our ancestors pass on their genes to future generations. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For example, even though we like eating food, we don't chew each mouthful of it for five minutes just to make the enjoyment last longer. </font></p><img id="i-23f0489e4d198b73" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/04/04/11/32D5BF5B00000578-3522596-image-a-11_1459766294613.jpg" height="397" width="634" alt="Dr Zietsch explained the evolutionary reason why we engage in lengthy penetration may be because  the ridge of a penis scoops out existing sperm from the vagina. This allows that particular man's sperm to reach the egg" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That would be inefficient, and so we've evolved to find it gross.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Why we last so long is a pretty complicated question with no clear answer, but a clue may be in the way the penis is shaped. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In 2003, researchers showed – using artificial vaginas, artificial penises, and artificial sperm (corn syrup) – that the ridge around the head of the penis actually scoops out pre-existing syrup from the vagina.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">What this suggests is that men's repeated thrusting might function to displace other men's semen before ejaculating, ensuring their own swimmers have a better chance of reaching the egg first. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Incidentally, this could explain why it becomes painful for a man to continue thrusting after ejaculating, since that would risk scooping out his own semen as well.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">So what to do with this information?

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The size of a man’s penis plays a huge role in his self esteem.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Having a small  member can proliferate feelings of being less masculine or appealing to the opposite sex.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And so, men blighted by a smaller manhood may abstain from sexual encounters – or shy away from the locker rooms at the gym.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">These feelings of inadequacy can lead to depression, problems with intimacy and potentially even suicidal thoughts.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">However, a Beverly Hills urologist, Dr James Elist, has developed a revolutionary penile enhancement procedure that offers new hope to men with small penises.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A silicone implant is inserted into the penis during the $13,000 (£9,000) procedure – instantly increasing the length and girth by approximately two inches.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Dr Elist told Daily Mail Online that patients have the option of choosing between three implant sizes for the procedure: Large, extra large and double extra large.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The surgeon explained: ‘Nobody wants to have a small or medium one.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>Scroll down for video </strong></font></p><img id="i-b214c08729e088c3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/17/21/322FC79C00000578-0-image-a-58_1458251513874.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Dr James Elist, a urologist in Beverly Hills, has developed a breakthrough penile implant (pictured) - made of soft silicone - that increases the length and girth of a man's member by approximately two inches" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Dr Elist has been working as an urologist for more than 35 years.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He has always had an interest in men’s sexual dysfunction – and even garnered notoriety as the first doctor to link cigarette smoking with impotence.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘If men see the sign on cigarettes that say smoking can cause impotency, they can blame it on me,’ he said.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For decades, the doctor was one of many who performed an operation on men with erectile dysfunction, in which a prosthesis was inserted into the arteries of the penis.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The procedure was designed to allow blood to properly flow through the arteries, so that a man could achieve an erection.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Dr Elist explained: ‘I noticed after insertion of the implant, between a year or two, most men were complaining that the size of their penis shrunk.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘They did have an erection, but the girth and length of the penis decreased.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In 2002, the doctor discovered a solution for the ‘shrinking’ problem.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">At the time, there were many penile enhancement treatments available – but none were effective.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Fat injections were previously used to increase the girth, but Dr Elist told Daily Mail Online that fat is absorbed after five or six months.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He said: ‘It gives the patients total deformity, because it was forming lumps and bumps under the penis.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Furthermore, foreign tissue transplants and even gel fillers – which are commonly used on the face to decrease wrinkles – proved to be ineffective as well.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That’s why Dr Elist came up with the idea of implanting a soft silicone sheath under the penis.</font></p><img id="i-fd5833f5dd58a4b2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/17/22/322FC62600000578-0-image-a-59_1458252271195.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Dr Elist (pictured) developed the implant after noticing men who underwent surgery for erectile dysfunction were reporting that their penises 'shrunk' after the procedure.

During the $13,000 (£9,000) operation, Dr Elist inserts a soft silicone sheath (bottom right) implant under the skin of the penis. The implant is available in sizes large, extra large and double extra large (top right). It covers the entire length, and wraps 270 degrees around the penis (inset). The entire procedure only takes 45 minutes - and immediately afterwards, a man's penis increases by approximately two inches in both length and girth. Dr Elist told Daily Mail Online that patients who undergo the operation experience a surge of self-confidence in the aftermath. He said: 'This is similar to breast implants – but a breast implant is a bag filled with silicone gel or in some cases saline. My implant is different; it’s not filled with anything. The material is very soft silicone with the shape of the penis – which covers the penis for 270 degrees around and the whole length of the penis.’</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Lizzie Parry</dc:creator><dc:modified>2016-03-18T18:57:19.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>New hope for men wanting to enlarge their manhood...</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2016-03-18T18:57:19.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3492153/It-s-not-just-women-MEN-need-pelvic-floor-exercises-too.html" title="It's not just women - MEN need to do pelvic floor exercises, too! "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3491194/Man-thought-torn-skin-enthusiastic-sex-actually-suffering-penile-cancer-robbed-manhood.html" title="Man, 31, who thought he had torn his skin during over-enthusiastic sex actually had penile cancer which has 'robbed him of his manhood'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3490970/Contraceptive-pill-men-step-closer.html" title="Contraceptive pill for men could be a step closer: Experts discover way to pause fertility as they look for product that would have no side effects "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3496572/I-feared-never-sex-Woman-left-paralysed-torn-labia-thrown-truck-abusive-boyfriend-battles-walk-again.html" title="'I feared I would never have sex again': Woman left paralysed and with a torn labia after being thrown from a truck by abusive boyfriend finds love and walks again"></link></item><item><title>Would YOU insert a plastic bead into your penis to make you a better lover?

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14.4px;"><strong>When it comes to having sex or getting pregnant, there are many nuggets of so-called wisdom most of us take as gospel.</strong></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14.4px;"><strong>Many will have been reassured with advice like 'you can't get pregnant on your period' or told to stick their legs in the air if they are trying to conceive.</strong></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14.4px;"><strong>Others include those with dodgy hearts or bad backs taking it easy or abstaining all together.</strong></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14.4px;"><strong>As it turns out, most such messages are nothing but myths, </strong></span><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.healthista.com/7-sex-myths-even-smart-women-believe/"><strong>Healthista</strong></a><span style="font-size: 14.4px;"><strong> reveals.</strong></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14.4px;"><strong>Here, experts separate the facts from the common, and widely-believed, myths....</strong></span></p><img id="i-d8c1cf9f36bd55b6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/01/11/30C750A100000578-0-Dr_Gillian_Lockwood_a_consultant_obstetrician_and_gynaecologist_-a-16_1454326901021.jpg" height="516" width="634" alt="Dr Gillian Lockwood, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist and medical director of Midland's Fertility Services, said there's no time at which women aged between 15 and 50 can't get pregnant" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14.4px;"><strong>YOU CAN'T GET PREGNANT ON YOUR PERIOD</strong></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">There is no time at which a woman between the ages of 15 and 50 can't get pregnant, says Dr Gillian Lockwood, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist and medical director of Midland Fertility Services.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Ideally, the window of opportunity for implantation when conception can occur is a brief three to four day time which occurs round about cycle days 18 or 19, taking cycle day one as the first day of the period, she says.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But a good egg released during ovulation has a life span of possibly about four or five days days and healthy sperm have fertilising capacity for up to four days, she asserts.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'This is why we hear about lots of women who've thought, 'Oh, it's the tail end of my period. I'm perfectly safe', but actually, they get pregnant.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Furthermore, according to Dr Gabrielle Downey, consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician at BMI Hospital, The Priory in Birmingham, post-pregnancy you might be at increased risk.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">During pregnancy, all your hormone levels are high generally, except the ones that stimulate your ovaries to make eggs are low, she explains. But this changes.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'After you have had the baby, the brain tries to stimulate the ovaries again to make eggs so it can induce another pregnancy, so it sends out strong hormonal signals to the eggs to say: 'Right. Start working,' she says.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>HEADACHES ARE A GOOD EXCUSE NOT TO INDULGE... WRONG - SEX MIGHT ACTUALLY HELP</strong> </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In women, orgasm might actually help the pain of a headache cancelling out the age-old ‘Not tonight darling…’ excuse.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In fact, in research published in 2013, a team of neurologists from the University of Munster, Germany found that over half of migraine sufferers who had sex during an episode experienced an improvement in symptoms.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Staggeringly, one of five finished with no pain at all – a difference seen in male sufferers in particular.</font></p><img id="i-757535b6bc5d629d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/01/11/30C7515900000578-0-image-a-18_1454326943985.jpg" height="412" width="634" alt="Rather than an excuse not to, sex can actually help if you have a headache, German researchers found" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The researchers theorised that sex triggered the release of endorphins, the body’s natural painkillers, through the central nervous system, which could reduce or eliminate a headache.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Indeed, according to Dr Beverley Whipple, the neurophysicist from Rutgers University who discovered the G-spot in the late 70s (on the front wall of the vagina, 5cm from the entrance), having this area stimulated to orgasm increased women’s pain threshold by 106 per cent.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>SEX AND ORGASM CAN STIMULATE EARLY LABOUR </strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Theoretically, sex can induce labour, but the cervix needs to be ready, explains Dr Downey. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Semen contains hormones called prostaglandins (which come from the man’s prostate gland) which can soften the cervix and stimulate contractions.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Synthetic forms of these are used medically to induce labour, which is why – theoretically – it’s possible that sex may hasten labour. </font></p><img id="i-740d1e5818d8fc24" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/01/11/30C7545200000578-0-Sex_can_only_help_to_induce_labour_if_the_cervix_is_ready_Theref-a-22_1454327213911.jpg" height="425" width="634" alt="Sex can only help to induce labour if the cervix is ready. Therefore, sex at 20 weeks is not going to make a woman go into early labour, Dr Gabrielle Downey explains" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But only if you’re close to your due date.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Your cervix has to ripen and be receptive to prostaglandins and this only happens near the end of your pregnancy,’ Dr Downey says. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘If your cervix isn’t ready, having sex at 20 weeks won’t make you go into early labour.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Having said that, sex may induce Braxton Hicks contractions, caused by the pain from tightening of the uterine muscles felt often in the second or third trimester and sometimes mistaken for labour pains.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Anything that stimulates movement in the uterus can cause Braxton Hicks – including sex – but the difference will be that they tend to only last 20-30 seconds and will rarely stop you from doing what you’re doing, which is a tell tale sign you’re in labour’.</font></p><img id="i-e14790b5668a4d84" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/01/11/30C76BCF00000578-0-image-a-21_1454327025260.jpg" height="416" width="634" alt="But sex may induce Braxton Hicks contractions, caused by the pain from tightening of the uterine muscles, which can sometimes be mistaken for labour pains" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Plus, real labour pains start and get progressively worse and more frequent, while Braxton Hicks tend to be short-lived, she explains.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">There are caveats however.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If your midwife or consultant have said your membranes have ruptured (when a tear develops in the fluid-filled bag that surrounds the baby), if you have low-lying placenta (usually detectable at your 20 week scan), if you are having twins, are at increased risk of infection or expecting a premature baby, you may be advised to avoid sex during part or all of you pregnancy, Dr Downey explains. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong>PEEING <span class="mol-style-underline">BEFORE</span> SEX REDUCES THE RISK OF A URINARY TRACT INFECTION</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong> </strong>Around half of all women and one in 2,000 men will develop a urinary tract infection (UTI) each year, according to the NHS.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">UTIs develop when the bladder becomes infected, usually by bacteria which most commonly enter through the urethra.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Sex is a common cause of UTIs in young women in their 20s, says Dr Zaki Almallah, consultant urologist at BMI Hospital in Edgbaston.</font></p><img id="i-8cb278cfbe59cb2a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/01/11/30C766B500000578-0-Going_to_the_toilet_before_sex_is_the_number_one_cause_of_post_c-a-25_1454327342818.jpg" height="405" width="306" alt="Going to the toilet before sex is the number one cause of post-coital urinary tract infections, Dr David Kaufman" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But it also affects older women. One study in 2008 published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine also found that sexual intercourse was also associated with the risk of UTI in postmenopausal women too.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">While most of us are told to pee before and after sex to avoid UTIs, this is only half true, say experts.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Indeed, according one leading New York urologist Dr David Kaufman, peeing before sex ‘is the number one cause of post-coital urinary tract infections.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">According to Kaufman, UTIs can be caused when during sex, bacteria can get pushed into the urethra. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But not urinating before sex means you will have enough stored in the bladder to create a strong stream, making it more likely that bacteria will be flushed.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">While Mr Almallah says there’s no real evidence for Dr Kaufman’s theory, he says there is no need to urinate before sex if you don’t need to, as it will have no effect on preventing a post-intercourse UTI. But urinating afterwards can help.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Bacteria that cause UTIs usually live naturally in the area called the perineum – between the anus, vagina and urethra – and sex can transport bacteria from these areas into the bladder through the pipe of the urethra.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Urinating after sex means you’re flushing out any bacteria that has lodged during intercourse into the urethra, which is the source of this transport of bacteria into the bladder, thus helping minimise your chances of a post-sex UIT,’ Mr Almallah explains.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>HAVING SEX INCREASES YOUR CHANCES OF A HEART ATTACK... (MYTH EXCEPT IF YOU'RE CHEATING) </strong> </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Heart attack patients are often apprehensive about getting busy between the sheets but a paper published last week in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology suggests they needn’t worry.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Researchers looked at the health histories of 536 heart disease patients aged 30 to 70 and found that sexual activity was not a risk factor in any subsequent heart attacks.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Less than one per cent of patients reported having sex within an hour before having a heart attack while 78 per cent said they had sex more than 24 hours before the heart attack.</font></p><img id="i-7428479bf153ddc3"

‘sudden coital death’ – a fatal heart attack during sex – during sex with someone other than their wives" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">‘Based on our data, it seems unlikely that sexual activity is a relevant trigger for heart attack,’ said Deitrich Rothenbacher, lead author of the study and professor and chair of the Institute of Epidemiology and Medical Biometry at Ulm University, Germany. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">‘Patients need not be worried and should resume their usual sexual activity.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Someone will happen to have a heart attack at the same time as they’re having sexual intercourse and those are the cases we hear about, says Dr Mark Knapton, associate medical director of the British Heart Foundation. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘But they were going to have a heart attack anyway, it’s not the sex that did it.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">‘What’s more worrying is when patients experience erectile dysfunction as this is often a sign of an underlying heart problem,’ added Dr Knapton.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The same rules don’t apply if to the adulterous, however.</font></p><img id="i-79f245a5bc9d7a13"

style="font-size:1.2em">A paper published in 2012 in The Journal of Sexual Medicine found men were more likely to experience ‘sudden coital death’ – a fatal heart attack during sex – during sex with someone other than their wives.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Sex causes arousal, excitement, stimulation of the adrenal glands,’ says Dr Knapton, adding that these effects may be heightened with a new partner.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘It’s a bit like the excitement of watching a football match, which has also been reported to lead to increased numbers of calls to health emergency services because of cardiac problems.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Of course, we would advise waiting 4-6 weeks after your heart attack before resuming sexual activity, but after that, sex generally won’t cause an increased risk of heart attack.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Those with significant heart failure, damage to their heart muscle or a history of severe angina might experience breathlessness that could limit their sexual activity, and should talk to their doctors.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Sexual activity can in fact, count as an essential part of the 30 minutes a day exercise regime of heart attack patients, Dr Knapton advises. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">But only if it lasts that long – which is unlikely, he says.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Indeed, a paper published in January 2013 in the New England Journal of Medicine examined the body of evidence for the claim that sex is good exercise and concluded that the average bout of sexual activity was only six minutes and expended a paltry 21 calories.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong>IF YOU LIE WITH YOUR FEET IN THE AIR YOU INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING PREGNANT </strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">In fact, lying down instead is more effective at increasing your chances of pregnancy.</font></p><img id="i-942b19030c5269d1"

flat - not with feet in the air" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A randomised controlled trial published in the British Medical Journal in 2009 looked at 400 couples who were being artificially inseminated and found that the women that lay flat for 15 minutes had a 50 per cent greater chance of getting pregnant than those that immediately got up and walked around.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The same may hold true when comes to getting pregnant after having sex, says Dr  Downey.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But while there’s absolutely no need to stand on your head, you can help the process along.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘A woman’s uterus is bent slightly forwards so if you tilt your pelvis upward a little, say by putting a pillow under your lower back as you lie down, the sperm will have less of a distance to travel,’ says Dr Downey.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘That means they are effectively travelling downhill and need less energy to get to where they want to go.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But why 15 minutes? Post-sex sperm have to get into the womb, travel across it and through the fallopian tubes, she explains.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘I would actually suggest that lying down for half an hour after sex would be better, to ensure this process has enough time to happen,’ advises Dr Downey.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">After that, gravity isn’t quite so important to sperm’s movements as the fallopian tubes have rhythmical movements within them that help the movement of sperm along, she explains. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong>PEOPLE WITH BAD BACKS SHOULD AVOID STRENUOUS SEX </strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A staggering four out of five people experience at least one episode of debilitating low back pain in their lifetimes and up to 84 per cent of men and 73 per cent of women with the condition report a decrease in the frequency of sex.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But research published in October last year in the journal Spine found that certain positions could make sex less painful for sufferers – depending on the type of back pain you have.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Women who get low back pain when they arch their backs or lie on their stomachs experienced less pain in the missionary position, the researchers found.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For men with back pain (especially if it hurt when they touched their toes or sat for too long), doggy style was the best position and adopting a ‘hip-hinging motion instead of thrusting with their spines’ could also lessen the pain.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">According to physiotherapist Tim Allardyce of Surrey Physio, doggy style is indeed a good position for low back pain in men – with one caveat.</font></p><img id="i-9eef8fe6d279507e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/01/11/30C7718700000578-3426344-image-a-35_1454327708644.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="Trying different sexual positions can help people with back pain, according to the journal Spine" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘They have to ensure they are on their knees rather than standing up,’ he explains.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘One of the biggest causes of pain for lower back pain sufferers or those with slipped discs is forward bending,’ he says.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘By kneeling the back remains in a safe position, maintaining its natural curve which will minimise the pain during sex.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If the man is standing on the other hand (with the woman on all fours on the bed) he will often have to bend his knees a little, round his back and lean forward to get the right angle, Mr Allardyce says. This can increase low back pain or strain an existing injury.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He agrees that the missionary is good for women with lower back pain as it keeps her spine on neutral, that is, in a slight S-shaped from the lower to upper spine, thus minimising pain or further injury.</font></p><img id="i-d27b3002a3efc56a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/01/12/30C781F600000578-3426344-Experts_say_doggy_style_is_indeed_a_good_position_for_low_back_p-a-46_1454328722747.jpg" height="406" width="634" alt="Experts say doggy style is indeed a good position for low back pain in men - but only if they're kneeling down" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Kneeling during doggy style or woman on top may also work for women – as long as she doesn’t arch her back too much.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘The main thing is to keep that natural curve in the spine and not round or arch.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">What women should avoid is bending fully forwards with the man behind them, as this puts too much strain on the lower discs of the spine and may lead to injury, says Mr Allardyce.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">While there’s no reason those with back pain need to avoid having sex, some things are just asking for trouble, he asserts.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘When people start doing like having sex over sofas or in cars and showers, they often need to get their bodies into tight, complicated environments and find themselves aggravating an existing back problem or creating a whole new one,’ he warns.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">So what’s the most back-unfriendly sex move? ‘Definitely a man trying to pick someone up – literally – against a wall, in the shower or into mid-air,’ says Mr Allardyce.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong><strong>This article originally appeared in and is re-produced here with the permission of </strong></strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.healthista.com/eating-your-own-placenta-what-the-experts-say/"><strong><strong>Healthista</strong></strong></a><strong><strong>.  </strong></strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"> </font></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Most people have listened to advice about sex, tips on the best positions to conceive and used the 'excuse' of not being in the mood when we have a headache.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It is one sexual health message no one can claim to have missed - wearing a condom helps prevent unwanted pregnancy, and protects against sexually transmitted diseases.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Despite the medical evidence and common sense, still countless couples get carried away, letting their passion get the better of them.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Not wearing a condom is the biggest condom-related mistake, a person can make.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But, even when acting responsibly and taking the precaution, still accidents can happen.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Rips and tears though uncommon, do happen, but they are not the only condom-wearing hazard couples face.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Men’s sexual health expert, Dr Paul Turek of The Turek Clinic in California, revealed to Daily Mail Online the 10 most common errors made when putting on and wearing condoms.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">From reusing a condom to double-bagging, these unnecessary errors put people at risk for unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, he warned.</font></p><img id="i-6a31aad1b51bf069" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/08/23/2FEDFC9100000578-0-image-a-65_1452294145574.jpg" height="448" width="634" alt="Men's sexual health expert Dr Paul Turek of The Turek Clinic in California told Daily Mail Online about the 10 most common condom mistakes - each of which are avoidable errors that can result in pregnancy or STDs" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong></strong><strong>1. PUTTING IT ON INSIDE OUT</strong><strong></strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It’s pretty difficult to put a condom on inside out.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That’s because one way is much harder to roll out than the other, Dr Turek explained.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And so, a person should – in theory – only be able to put it on one way.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But despite the struggle it may present, many men still end up putting the condom on inside out.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Dr Turek explained: ‘You have to have some kind of mechanical sense, because there’s really only one easy way to roll it out.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you’re using a condom that doesn’t contain spermicide, putting it on inside out isn’t the end of the world.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘It’s a barrier contraceptive so it shouldn’t matter which way it unravels unless there’s spermicide on the inside and not on the outside,’ he said.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But, using an inside out condom with spermicide on the wrong side could decrease the effects of the spermicide – which is supposed to stop sperm from moving.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>2. DOUBLE-BAGGING</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you want to be extra careful, be sure to wear two condoms. At least, that’s how the saying goes.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But in reality, wearing two condoms isn’t as effective as wearing only one.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That’s because two condoms can be a pretty tight fit.</font></p><img id="i-3c5c018e251e56a7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/08/23/2FEDFCC800000578-0-image-a-66_1452294156114.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Putting on a condom inside out is a bad idea - if the condom contains spermicide, which stops sperm from moving. Furthermore, wearing more than one condom at a time can cause a penis to lose sensation - or lead to a rip due to condom-on-condom friction, Dr Turek said" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And if it’s too tight, it can constrict the penis – and you can lose sensation.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘That could lead to delayed ejaculation and getting all sweaty and not ending it,’ Dr Turek said.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Additionally, condom-on-condom friction could lead to a rip in one or both of the condoms – which could allow sperm to escape.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>3. PUTTING IT ON TOO LATE</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Many men wait for foreplay to be done before putting on a condom.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That can be a fine tactic – unless your foreplay involves any penetration.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Any skin-to-skin contact could potentially lead to a STD or pregnancy.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For a man’s pre-ejaculate could actually be loaded with sperm, according to Dr Turek.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And so, waiting ‘too long’ to put a condom on is never a good idea.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘That’s a risky move,’ Dr Turek said.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>4. PUTTING IT ON TOO SOON</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">At the other end of the spectrum, a man shouldn’t attempt to put on a condom when his penis is not yet erect.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Doing so may mean that the condom does not sit properly on the penis.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And, it may even prohibit a man from getting to a place where he could even have sex.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘It may be difficult to get a good erection that does a good job,’ Dr Turek noted.</font></p><img id="i-73afec72551891dd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/08/23/2FEDFC8100000578-0-image-a-67_1452294172454.jpg" height="419" width="634" alt="When it comes to applying a condom, timing is everything, Dr Turek said. Putting it on before a penis is errect can lead to improper applicaiton, while doing it too late could lead to sperm to entering a vagina during foreplay. Leaving it on too long could result in sperm plugging the urethra, which creates sperm-filled pre-ejaculate fluid" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>5. LEAVING IT ON TOO LONG</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">After sex, many partners want to lie in each other’s arms, taking in the moment.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But before the love coma sets in, a man should be sure to take off his condom. Because if he leaves it on too long, he risks having his ejaculate harden.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Dr Turek said: ‘That could be irritating to the skin because it has a lot of anti-inflammatory molecules.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Additionally, the ejaculate could end up plugging the penis’s urethra.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That means leftover sperm could end up staying in place and mixing with pre-ejaculate fluid.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In turn, that could potentially impregnate a woman during foreplay the next time around.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>6. ROLLING A CONDOM OUT BEFOREHAND</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Some men roll a condom out the entire way before putting it on their penis.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That makes the entire process much more difficult, according to Dr Turek.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And, it puts them at risk of breaking the condom.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Instead, men should be sure to put on a condom the way a woman puts on stockings.</font></p><img id="i-f30dcb7f851266ee" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/08/23/2FEDFC6C00000578-0-image-a-68_1452294184184.jpg" height="232" width="634" alt="A condom should be applied the same way a woman puts on stockings - it should be rolled on before being rolled out, rather than laid out completely before it is put on, Dr Turek explained" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘It’s much harder to lay a stocking out than it is to roll it up,’ he said.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Men don’t have a lot of experience with stockings, but they have a lot of experience with socks.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘They try to put it on like socks – and that is harder than putting it on like a stocking.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>7. USING EXPIRED CONDOMS</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You won’t drink expired milk or eat expired cheese. And, you cetainly wouldn’t take expired medicine.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Just as important – a man should also never use an expired condom.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘The effectiveness can’t be guaranteed,’ Dr Turek explains. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If a condom is expired, its rubber or latex can dry out.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That leads to cracks and holes in the condom.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Condoms have a useable lifespan like lots of things,’ Dr Turek said.</font></p><img id="i-2b58e723b5a2647a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/08/23/2FEDFF8000000578-0-image-a-69_1452294196285.jpg" height="480" width="634" alt="Like any product, condoms have a shelf-life, so using an expired condom puts you at risk of pregnancy or STDs, according to Dr Turek. Furthermore, many men 'overestimate' the size of their penis and end up getting condoms that are too big - which opens up 'ports of entry'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>8. GOING FOR THE WRONG SIZE</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Small, medium, large – men seem to have a hard time properly gauging their size.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Men love to overestimate the size of their penises,’ Dr Turek said.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But if a man is wearing a condom that’s too large, the condom could fall off, roll off or leak from the bottom.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And if a condom is too small, it can be uncomfortable or potentially break.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Dr Turek added: ‘The big damage is getting a condom too big for you that doesn’t stretch appropriately and seal off ports of entry.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>9. REUSING A CONDOM</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Recycling is important for the environment. But when it comes to sex, a man shouldn’t recycle a condom.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘It’s like reusing surgical gloves,’ Dr Turek explains.</font></p><img id="i-a26368b0dfdbf6a6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/08/23/2FEDFC7800000578-0-image-a-70_1452294217175.jpg" height="465" width="634" alt="Just as a doctor wouldn't reuse surgical gloves, it's never a good idea to reuse a condom. Leftover sperm can remain in the condom for days afterwards - and it's unhygienic, according to the doctor. " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Using a condom more than once is unhygienic.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Germs from the previous encounter could be spread to the next.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And, unless you wash out the condom with soap and wait five days, leftover sperm could stay alive.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Dr Turek noted: ‘It’s sort of disgusting.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><span class="mol-style-larger"></span><strong>10. NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO RIPS</strong><span class="mol-style-larger"></span></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Having a condom tear during sex isn’t that common, according to Dr Turek.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But, it’s easy to rip a condom prior to application.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He said: ‘Most of the tears occur not with use but with application – a finger nail or something sharp, an edge gets caught.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Though, if a condom is applied incorrectly or a partner has a tight or dry vagina, there is also a risk of tearing.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That’s why it’s important to pay attention to any possible tears.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you feel a snap – or the sensation changes – take a moment to check to ensure that the condom hasn’t torn at all. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"></font></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Men's sexual health expert Dr Paul Turek, of The Turek Clinic in Californina, explains to Daily Mail Online the dangers of reusing condoms, using expired condoms, 'double-bagging' and more.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Lizzie Parry</dc:creator><dc:modified>2016-01-21T21:31:35.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Revealed... the 10 most common condom mistakes</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2016-01-21T21:31:35.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3410372/What-polonium-210-public-inquiry-accuses-Putin-murdering-Alexander-Litvinenko-expert-reveals-substance-trillion-times-toxic-cyanide.html" title="What IS polonium-210?

I had to try it.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I chose mid-July as there were few social events to tempt me off the diet. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The Newcastle study was based on participants losing a sixth of their pre-diagnosis weight. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I was surprised to find I’d already unintentionally lost a stone while following a healthy diet since my diagnosis, so I only had to lose a further 9lb to reach my target of 8st 12lb.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">With my doctor’s support and advice from Professor Taylor, I started on the diet.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">My 800 calories a day came from three 200-calorie soups or shakes, and 200 calories of green vegetables (just as in the Newcastle study). </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I became inventive with the 200 calories of green veg, experimenting with new herbs. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Soups – particularly mushroom – became my passion and I would really look forward to them in the evening.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>Scroll down for video </strong></font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In the first three days I lost 4lbs and by the fourth, my blood sugar reading was down to 4.6. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I went through periods of feeling cold, despite wearing four layers of clothing under a bright sun, and sometimes my fingers went white. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I got very tired on occasion and remember once walking up the steep steps at a tube station after work and feeling like I’d been up all night. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Very occasionally, when hunger got to me, I felt a bit detached at work. However, I managed to work perfectly normally.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">My colleagues nicknamed me the 'disappearing man' as my weight loss was so visible and rapid. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">My one failure was not drinking sufficient water – at least 2-3 litres a day are advised to avoid dehydration and constipation, but I often drank considerably less. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This led to a severe bout of constipation, cured with a laxative.</font></p><img id="i-5011a66c8dc2a2b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/21/14/2FF0E88800000578-3410102-He_said_I_thought_my_diagnosis_was_ridiculous_how_could_someone_-a-6_1453387661165.jpg" height="475" width="634" alt="He said: 'I thought my diagnosis was ridiculous – how could someone with my weight and healthy lifestyle be facing the prospect of all the serious complications of type 2 diabetes in ten years’ time, including sight loss and a much greater risk of early death?'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I monitored my blood sugar levels constantly and by Day 11 my reading was just 4.1 mmol, well under the diabetic level of 6; the next day I reached my target weight. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Professor Taylor suggested I came off the liquid diet. I was ecstatic.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I went back to the diabetic-friendly diet I’d been on earlier, sticking to wholegrain foods, having no more than 50g portions of rice and pasta, generally avoiding cheese, and eating lots of fruit and veg. I have since continued to run regularly and go to a gym.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Until January my blood sugar results had been normal – but recently my stress levels have risen again for various reasons, including having an elderly parent with vascular dementia, which might be behind a slight rise to just below the ‘diabetes’ level.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">So I plan to return briefly to the low calorie diet: I want my pancreas back in shape and I know it can be done. </font></p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health">

But increasingly studies suggest that it may also be linked to type 2 diabetes, no matter how healthy your lifestyle.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Research published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine last September found that those under extreme pressure at work were 45 per cent more likely to develop the condition than those under minimal pressure. The results were based on a 13-year study of 5,000 men and women.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin or becomes less sensitive to its effects. Insulin acts like a key to allow sugar into cells and if, for example, someone is overweight that key works less well.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">One theory is that the stress hormone cortisol may also alter the body's sensitivity to insulin.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Stress leads to a rise in cortisol, a steroid hormone, and sometimes when you give individuals steroids (drugs that resemble cortisol) at a high dose, this impedes the action of insulin,' says Naveed Sattar, professor of medicine at the University of Glasgow. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Professor Andrew Steptoe, a psychologist and epidemiologist from University College London, says his research shows that people with type 2 diabetes react to stress differently - but whether this is what caused their diabetes or is a result of it, is not clear.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In a study of 420 adults, his team found that those with type 2 took longer to recover from a stressful event - their blood pressure and heart rate took longer to return to normal than those without diabetes. The results were published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Everyone responds to stress with an increase in pulse rate, blood pressure and release of stress hormones,' says Professor Steptoe.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But there was a difference in the length of this response between the healthy participants and those with type 2 - 'Ninety minutes after a stress experience they still hadn't returned to normal levels, unlike the healthy participants'.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Furthermore, Professor Steptoe found that the type 2 diabetics had higher levels of cortisol.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'It might be that they are more exposed to stress, or that they are in a state of high-level activation of the stress response.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14.4px;"><strong>How can a low calorie diet help? </strong></span></p><img id="i-d11fa67c65efd9c1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/21/15/306E63F400000578-3410102-Richard_s_800_calories_a_day_came_from_three_200_calorie_soups_o-a-8_1453388516576.jpg" height="466" width="634" alt="Richard's 800 calories a day came from three 200-calorie soups or shakes, and 200 calories of green vegetables.

The new study showed that a low-calorie diet could have the same effect.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As Roy Taylor, professor of medicine and metabolism at the University of Newcastle, who led the study, explains: ‘It’s now clear that type 2 diabetes is caused by abnormal fat storage. If you are eating more than you burn, then the excess is stored in the liver and pancreas as fat.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘On this diet, the mechanism is similar to what happens after bariatric surgery — the body is suddenly in negative calorie balance, so it calls on its own reserves of fat.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘The fat used first is that around the pancreas and liver. This means the pancreas is given a chance to start working again.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Alcohol is banned, while patients are encouraged to drink three litres of water a day.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Insulin lowers blood sugar and cuts down the loss of sugar in the urine, explains Professor Taylor — meaning that calories are no longer lost in this way.

You’ve talked to your doctor, cleared your kitchen cupboards of sugary snacks and now you’re ready to embark on the radical eight-week Blood Sugar Diet I’ve been describing in the first three parts of this series.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Yesterday, I outlined menu plans for the second week. Today, you’ll find suggestions to take you through week three. Once you’ve reached week four, the menu plans for weeks five to eight are simply a repetition of weeks one to four.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As I’ve explained previously, this strict, 800-calorie diet can make dramatic differences to blood sugar levels. If you are pre-diabetic (your blood sugar levels are abnormally high, but fall short of the diabetic range), this diet can stop you developing full-blown Type 2 diabetes.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you’re already a Type 2 diabetic, then this diet can reverse the condition, returning your blood sugar levels to normal.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As you will soon discover, the diet isn’t quite as tough as you may fear. Though you will be living on 800 calories a day for the next few weeks, your body should adapt reasonably fast, but what changes should you expect along the way?</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>The first two weeks</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">These are likely to be the toughest, as your body adapts to fewer calories, but you will find that you begin to lose weight, fast. Some of it will be fat, but initially you will also be passing a lot of urine. It is essential that you drink at least two to three litres of calorie-free fluid a day or you are likely to become constipated and suffer headaches.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you are not keen on tap water, try disguising it by adding a squeeze of lemon or lime, or fresh mint and cucumber. I love fizzy water with lots of ice and lemon.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Or drink plenty of fruit tea and the occasional coffee (but with only a splash of milk).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Some people drink just hot water and, oddly enough, there is evidence that heat alone can soothe hunger. Have zero-calorie fizzy drinks if you must, but not fruit juice or commercial smoothies.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>Weeks two to four</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">By week four, your blood sugars should start to stabilise at close to normal levels and your sugar cravings will, hopefully, be much reduced.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You will have lost a lot of weight, with much of it coming off your waist, judging by the results of the research trials that inspired me to devise this diet.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">These were carried out by Roy Taylor, professor of medicine and metabolism at Newcastle University. In one trial, 11 volunteers lost an average of 22 lb by the end of four weeks, most of it fat. They also lost nearly 3 in from their waists.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But a note of caution: when Professor Taylor did a follow-up study with people who were older and had been diabetic for much longer, the results were mixed.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Those who had been diabetic for fewer than four years did really well. But those who had been diabetic for more than eight years and were on lots of medication were less likely to see rapid improvements in their blood sugar levels.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That said, everyone reported feeling better, sleeping better and being more active. Blood pressure and cholesterol levels also improved across the board.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>After eight weeks</strong></font></p><img id="i-fa8c984788e12f3e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/19/23/305A710E00000578-3407500-image-a-26_1453247956347.jpg" height="498" width="470" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">By the end of the eight weeks, if not before, you will see some big changes in your body shape and biochemistry. You should be sleeping better and feeling a real sense of achievement.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Perhaps you need to buy new trousers. Maybe you stop and look in mirrors to admire the difference.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Pull out those old photos. Take new ones. Post them on Facebook or Twitter. Take time to celebrate what you’ve done with family and friends. Getting this far is a real achievement, but you don’t want to undo all the good work by reverting to your old lifestyle.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Your main preoccupation should now be: ‘How am I going to stay in this shape for the rest of my life?’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">keep your good habits</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As I’m sure you know, many people who diet end up regaining some, if not most, of the weight they have so painfully lost. But this is not inevitable. You should create a lifestyle you can stick to.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you try to avoid all your favourite foods and run 20 miles a day, then you’ll fail. Be realistic.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I lost 22 lb three years ago and occasionally I put a couple of pounds back on. But I can rapidly lose them again, and I’m sure the main reason I’ve succeeded in keeping off the weight is because I’ve gone from gorging on sugary carbs to following a Mediterranean-style eating plan. That, and a few other things you might find useful, too:</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ I try to sit at the kitchen table for every meal. If you eat on-the-go or in front of the TV, you will eat badly and beyond the point that you would normally feel full.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ It takes time for food to reach the parts of your small intestine where cells release a hormone, PYY, that tells your brain: ‘I’m full.’ That’s why if you eat slowly, you will eat less.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I regularly put down my knife and fork and try to wait for 30 seconds or so before picking them up again. I also leave food on my plate when I’m no longer hungry. It goes against everything I was taught when growing up.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ I avoid ‘diet’ products as they are usually highly processed and often contain sugar and/or sweeteners (which may not turn off hunger signals).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ I drink soup a lot. It is satiating, cheap and practical. I make large quantities, often out of leftover vegetables, and keep the unused stuff in the freezer.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ If you are drinking wine with your meal, leave the bottle on the other side of the room. Similarly, leave food serving dishes in the kitchen. I find that I am less likely to refill my glass or help myself to seconds if I have to get up from the table.</font></p><img id="i-9ed4de372d20398f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/19/23/305A70F400000578-3407500-image-a-28_1453247969781.jpg" height="405" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-3dea3fec50ab0dfa" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/19/23/305A70D300000578-3407500-image-a-29_1453247980709.jpg" height="606" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-89bf6136065dbd90" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/19/23/305A70C400000578-3407500-image-a-31_1453247985701.jpg" height="536" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-5772e6abd15732cf" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/20/00/30501E6000000578-3407500-image-a-35_1453248373064.jpg" height="722" width="470" alt="Adapted from The 8-Week Blood Sugar Diet: Lose Weight Fast And Reprogramme Your Body by Michael Mosley (Short Books, £8.99). © Michael Mosley 2016.

My children sometimes sneak in chocolate and biscuits, but know better than to leave them anywhere they can be spotted.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ My weakness is toast. I did suggest to my wife that we throw out the toaster (I would rarely bother to use the grill), but she refused. Instead, I keep unsalted nuts by the toaster, so when I am tempted to snack on toast and marmalade, I eat nuts instead. Mostly.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ I weigh myself several times a week, despite the widely held belief that you should only get on the scales once a week. This is contradicted by a recent trial that followed 40 people on diets. Some weighed themselves daily, others weekly, monthly or hardly at all. The more often people weighed themselves, the more weight they lost.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ When I go out for a meal, I make sure the bread basket is never left on the table or I would just help myself. I stick to one course, with lots of vegetables instead of rice or potatoes. I rarely have a dessert and, when I do, I always share it. Research shows that a small amount of something sticky and tasty is just as satisfying as a large amount.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ I try not to go shopping on an empty stomach and aim to fill half the trolley, at least, with healthy stuff. I used to kid myself that if I bought cake or a packet or biscuits I would only eat a small amount. I know that’s not true. For the same reason, I never buy large bars of chocolate, however much of a bargain they may seem.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ My family got a dog, Tari, and she barks loudly if we don’t take her for a walk at least once a day. This is great exercise for humans, too, but is perhaps not the most practical tip if you live in a city — or prefer cats.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ Keep busy. Take up a new hobby that will keep your body and mind active. I started dancing. It got my heart going and was mentally challenging.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ every day I acknowledge ‘three good things’. This is based on an idea devised by the U.S. psychologist, Professor Martin Seligman. At the end of the day, think of three things that went well and why they did so. It doesn’t have to be much, perhaps someone complimented you or you saw a beautiful sunset. It focuses your attention on the positives and boosts your mood.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ Most weeks I try to fast. For one day I attempt to go at least 12 hours without food. I do this by having breakfast, skipping lunch and eating a light evening meal. There are health benefits from short periods of fasting and it reminds me that I can control hunger and it does not control me.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ I think it is sad how many people stand on escalators when they could be burning a few extra calories by walking up them. I normally try to run up them. And that’s just part of the simple fitness regime that has helped to keep me healthy.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I’ll talk more about that in tomorrow’s Mail, introducing you to one of the biggest breakthroughs in sports science in a decade — a cardio programme that takes just a few minutes per week, but can significantly improve your aerobic fitness, boost your mood and make following the Blood Sugar Diet easier.</font></p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"><span class="mol-style-larger"><strong>My GP says I've added TEN YEARS to my life</strong></span></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><span class="mol-style-italic"><strong>Julian Porter, 53, a photographer, lives with his wife, Sue, who is also a photographer, in Southampton, Hampshire.

Then, back home, I’d unwind with a couple of beers and a bag of crisps. I was always snacking and eating takeaways.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">At 5 ft 8 in, I weighed 18 st 7 lb, giving me a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 39.3, ‘severely obese’. But I didn’t worry about it and just covered up my growing waistline in sharp suits.</font></p><img id="i-33c21957dbe4584d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/19/23/30292FEF00000578-3407500-image-m-9_1453247440519.jpg" height="507" width="470" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-c54f0ba4339b7682" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/19/23/3029315200000578-3407500-image-a-10_1453247450777.jpg" height="507" width="470" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Then, at a routine check-up, I was told I had Type 2. It hit me hard, as the previous week I’d done a photoshoot for the charity Diabetes UK with a man who’d had both legs amputated owing to complications from Type 2. So I was very aware of how dangerous the condition could be.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I was already on statins for high cholesterol and blood pressure pills, and was at high risk of a heart attack, and now I was being put on the diabetes drug metformin. I immediately decided I had to lose weight.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I came across research into the 800-calorie diet and worked out that if I did a lot of exercise, I could increase the calories to 1,000 with the same results. (I also checked with my GP that it was safe for me to follow this diet.)</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Every morning, I got up early and walked for an hour on a treadmill. For breakfast I had porridge and berries, for lunch, crispbread or an open sandwich and in the evenings a good dinner — usually a combination of vegetables, protein and carbohydrates, for instance, salmon and pasta. I never cut out carbs, as I needed them for energy to exercise and I ate nothing after 6pm until the next morning.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Amazingly, I didn’t feel hungry, and in four weeks I lost a stone. I began to exercise more, as I had more energy and wanted to speed up my weight loss — the weight dropped off even quicker, and in five months I lost 7 st. I couldn’t believe how great I felt.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">When I went back to my GP for a blood test, my sugar levels were completely normal. My GP couldn’t believe it and sent the results back to the lab saying they must be wrong.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But when I was retested, the results came back the same. My GP told me he wasn’t sure it was even possible to reverse diabetes, as I had — but it was!</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Now I’ve come off the metformin and even the statins. My high blood pressure is hereditary, so I still need the pills, but it’s a lot more stable now.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I got down to 10 st 7 lb and when I turned up for weddings, people I’d seen the previous year didn’t recognise me.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I’ve since put on a stone, as I was told I looked too gaunt, and I’ve stopped counting calories, as I can now gauge the right amount of food I need. My golden rule is never eat at weddings!</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">My BMI is a healthy 24 and to maintain my weight I have started running outdoors — I’d always been too embarrassed to be seen in running shorts before, but now I look fine. Most days I also cycle about 40 miles.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The best thing about it all is that my GP says I’ve added ten years to my life.</font></p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox health">

                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">We are all different. Many people find sticking to 800 calories a day surprisingly easy and just keep going. It works well for people who are motivated.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But no one diet is going to suit us all. If you begin the diet and really don’t feel well on it, or you find 800 calories a day, every day, either too tough or too inconvenient to stick to for the full eight weeks, then I would recommend the 5:2 approach I outline in my bestselling book The Fast Diet.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It is very simple. For five days a week you don’t calorie-count, but follow the low-carb Mediterranean diet I described earlier. Then, for the remaining two days, you cut down your calories to 800 a day using the menus in this series.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You can do this on any two days of the week that suit you, but it is best to be consistent so you get into a pattern.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You won’t lose weight as fast as you would if you stuck to 800 calories a day, but it can be more effective than conventional dieting. Studies suggest the 5:2 approach is easier to stick to; you lose fat faster and see greater improvements in insulin sensitivity.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In the original version of the Fast Diet, I recommend that men stick to 600 calories and women to 500 twice a week. Going up to 800 is unlikely to make much of a difference, particularly if you go low-carb on the other days.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The 5:2 diet was how I reversed my own diabetes, and since I wrote that book I have received many emails from ‘former diabetics’, including Leo, who had been a Type 2 diabetic for 12 years.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Despite taking medication, Leo’s blood sugar was so bad that in 2012, his doctor said he needed insulin injections. Instead, Leo did my 5:2 diet, lost 44 lb in three months and became drug-free.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Three years later, he has put on a few pounds but his blood sugar remains fine.</font></p></div>

Intruder hallucinations consist of a sense of evil presence in the room, which can also manifest into hyper realistic multisensory hallucinations of an actual intruder. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Incubus hallucinations often co-occur with intruder hallucinations, and describe a sensation of pressure on the chest and feelings of being suffocated.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The third category include so-called vestibular-motor hallucinations, which typically don't occur with the other two, and consist of 'illusory movement experiences' such as floating above the bed.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Sleep paralysis is more common than you may think. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In a recent UK study, nearly 30 per cent of respondents said that they had experienced at least one episode of sleep paralysis in their lifetime. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A smaller percentage, around 8 per cent of the 862 participants, reported more frequent episodes. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A systematic review of over 30 studies from a variety of countries reported a more conservative estimate, of around 10 per cent.Sp</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Sleep paralysis is a common symptom of narcolepsy, a sleep disorder where the brain's ability to regulate a normal sleep-wake cycle becomes disrupted. </font></p><img id="i-c9e71ed713f13a91" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/18/15/304DA3E000000578-0-Sleep_paralysis_can_make_people_hallucinate_with_people_who_expe-a-10_1453130903650.jpg" height="413" width="634" alt="Sleep paralysis can make people hallucinate with people who experience intruder hallucinations describing feeling an evil presence in the room" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It also appears to be more common in a number of psychiatric conditions, particular post-traumatic stress disorder, and patients with panic disorder.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But many individuals suffer from sleep paralysis without any apparent psychiatric or neurological condition. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In a recent study, we looked at potential risk factors and found that stressful life events, anxiety, and sleep quality all had an impact. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This is supported by other studies showing that groups of people who experience disrupted and irregular sleep, such as shift workers, are at a higher risk of sleep paralysis.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">We also looked at the role of genetics, by comparing the frequency of sleep paralysis in identical twins, who share almost 100 per cent of their genes, with the occurrence in non-identical twins, who on average share about 50 per cent of their genes. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">We found that there was indeed a genetic link. Our research even suggested that a particular variation in a gene involved in the regulation of our sleep wake cycle may be associated with sleep paralysis. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But more studies are needed to confirm this.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>LABORATORY STUDIES </strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Every night, we pass through a number of different sleep stages.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">After falling asleep, we pass through stages one to three, reflecting a deepening level of unconsciousness, known collectively as non-REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">After coming back to stage one sleep we enter a period of rapid eye movement sleep, which is unique for a number of reasons.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">REM sleep is a period of heightened brain activity, associated with vivid dreaming. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">During REM sleep our muscles are completely paralysed (apart from the eyes and respiratory system). </font></p><img id="i-9b87711d005dbc2e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/18/15/304DA61300000578-0-image-a-11_1453131042815.jpg" height="469" width="634" alt="As we sleep, our body passes through different sleep stages like rapid eye movement sleep where our muscles are completely paralysed.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">The food we eat today, along with our sedentary lifestyle, is not only making us fat but putting us at risk of Type 2 diabetes — and it’s one of the greatest epidemics of our time. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">More than 4 million Britons now have this disease, while one in three adults has raised blood sugar levels that can lead to diabetes, yet most don’t know it.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Now, help is at hand. Based on research carried out at the University of Newcastle, I have put together a simple diet plan and lifestyle programme that should not only reduce your risk of getting Type 2 diabetes, but can reverse it in those already suffering — all in only eight weeks.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">What’s more, it’s not just for those at highest risk but for anyone who wants to lose weight fast and regain control of their health.</font></p><img id="i-617d1b5d860e7381" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/18/01/0921AE27000005DC-3404259-image-a-149_1453080529291.jpg" height="628" width="962" alt="Dr Michael Mosley has put together a simple diet plan and lifestyle programme suitable for those at risk of getting Type 2 diabetes,  those already suffering with it - and anyone who wants to lose weight fast and regain control of their health" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Sounds good? Well, here’s a little story to inspire you.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Hanging in the wardrobe at 56-year-old Alan Tutty’s home in Sunderland is an old shirt that he won’t be throwing out any time soon.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">According to Alan, a father of four, it once used to fit him ‘like cling-film’. These days, it’s much looser — which is all down to the diet he went on three years ago.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In just eight weeks, Alan lost two stone. And he has since kept most of that weight off, even though he admits to being ‘no angel’.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Occasionally I’ll have takeaways, and wine, cheese and beer,’ he says. ‘But I put the shirt on every so often to see if it’s still loose, and as long as it is, I’m doing fine.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Far more significant than the fit of his shirt, though, is the fact that Alan, who was diagnosed with diabetes shortly before he began the diet, has had normal blood sugar levels ever since.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Yet he might still have had Type 2 diabetes today had he not been lucky enough to be one of 11 people recruited for a research trial at Newcastle University, conducted by Roy Taylor, professor of medicine and metabolism.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As I explained in Saturday’s Mail, Professor Taylor has met a lot of opposition for claiming that a very low-calorie diet can swiftly reverse Type 2 diabetes.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And yet the results of this experiment were nothing short of remarkable. By following a strict diet for two months, the volunteers lost an average of 33 lb and 5 in around the waist. And all saw their blood sugar levels return to normal.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A follow-up study, with people who had been diabetic for longer, found that most achieved similar results. That is why Professor Taylor’s research is the inspiration for my new Blood Sugar Diet.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It follows on from my highly successful Fast Diet, which helps people lose weight with what I call a 5:2 regime — eating normally five days a week and cutting your calorie intake for the other two. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you have pre-diabetes — blood sugar levels that are abnormally high but fall short of the diabetic range — I offer a plan that should stop you progressing to full-blown Type 2 diabetes, the kind associated with poor diet and an unhealthy lifestyle. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And if you already have Type 2 diabetes, significant weight loss can even reverse it.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Today, I’ll outline suggested menu plans for the first week (created by leading dietitian Dr Sarah Schenker). But if you are to stick to the diet, it’s important that you understand the thinking behind it, so I want to explain a key feature that is crucial to the diet’s success. This is an emphasis on the Mediterranean way of eating.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>Benefits of the Mediterranean diet </strong><strong><span class="mol-style-larger"><span class="mol-style-large"></span></span></strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Many experts now believe that the recent surge in diabesity (diabetes plus obesity) has been fuelled by an obsession with low-fat eating, leading to over-consumption of cheap and easily digestible carbohydrates.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Rapidly absorbed by your body, these create an instant spike in blood sugar levels, which then crash, making you hungry again and eventually causing your body to become resistant to insulin, the hormone that regulates our blood sugar.</font></p><img id="i-56f5cf0edb7a8661" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/18/01/304592CD00000578-3404259-image-a-152_1453080699406.jpg" height="627" width="470" alt="The tasty way to get back to health: Avoid the baddies such as sugar and processed foods " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This, in turn, contributes to the build-up of fat in your liver and pancreas, which, Professor Taylor suggests, lies at the heart of our blood sugar problems.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The ‘baddies’ include not just the sugar that you quaff down in fizzy drinks or add to your tea, but also consuming too many natural sugars such as honey, maple syrup, agave nectar etc. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Processed foods — crackers, cakes, breakfast cereals — are stuffed full of sugar, as are more surprising foods such as muffins and flavoured yoghurts.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Easily digestible carbs include starchy foods — bread, rice, pasta and potatoes — and yet, diabetics are encouraged to eat plenty of these as part of the standard medical advice, which suggests that they should cut down on sugar and follow a low-fat diet.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I was recently in a London teaching hospital chatting to a 55-year-old man who was about to have his foot amputated because of Type 2 diabetes.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">When I asked him what he had been offered for breakfast that morning, he said: ‘I had a choice of white bread or cornflakes.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Twenty years ago, you could have been forgiven for feeding diabetics this sort of food. But since then, there have been dozens of studies suggesting this is not the way to go.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A recent review of 20 research trials, involving a total of more than 3,000 people with Type 2 diabetes, found that if you want to lose weight and improve your cholesterol and blood sugar control, then your best bet is a Mediterranean diet.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">People have been talking about the Mediterranean diet for years — but how many of us know what it really is? </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It’s certainly not a diet that most people associate with the Med. There is no pizza or pasta: instead, it emphasises the importance of eating fruit, vegetables, oily fish, nuts and olive oil.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">There are carbs in this diet, but they’re the sort that contain lots of fibre. It means they take longer to be absorbed by the body and won’t cause those dangerous spikes in blood sugar. Examples include vegetables, legumes (beans, pulses and lentils) and wholegrains.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The impressive thing about Mediterranean-style eating is just how widespread its benefits are. Studies have shown that it not only cuts your risk of heart disease and diabetes, but it may also delay the onset of dementia and cognitive impairment (when you struggle with remembering, learning new things and making decisions).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Consuming extra-virgin olive oil seems to be particularly beneficial when it comes to preventing breast cancer, perhaps because it contains compounds such as polyphenols, which are known for their anti-inflammatory effects.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A very recent finding is that women who followed a Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil had 68 per cent less chance of developing breast cancer than those on a low-fat diet. (Tip: keep your oils in a cupboard as they degrade in sunlight.)</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">All in all, this is a fantastically healthy and tasty way to eat. It takes many of the best features of a low-carb diet and makes them more palatable, and that’s why it’s at the crux of the Blood Sugar Diet.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">On this page, you will find a suggested menu plan for the first week of the diet (those for the next three weeks will follow later this week). If you repeat these four-week menu plans for a second month, by the end of week eight you should have seen the pounds drop off dramatically — and your blood sugar returning back towards normal.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Feel free to mix and match recipes from different days. You will get quickest results from sticking to 800 calories a day. If this sounds too difficult, don’t worry, later in this series I will be outlining how to use the 5:2 approach to achieve better blood sugar control. But first, some important checks.</font></p><img id="i-522573d7b8d26fb3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/18/01/303E07C200000578-3404259-image-a-145_1453080457483.jpg" height="698" width="470" alt="Adapted from The 8-Week Blood Sugar Diet: Lose Weight Fast And Reprogramme Your Body by Michael Mosley" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong><span class="mol-style-large">Before you start, it’s vital to take these precautions</span></strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you are on medication, talk to your GP. This is particularly important because he or she should be involved in monitoring and tapering off your medicines. It’s also essential that you discuss the diet with your doctor if any of the following apply:</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ you are on insulin or any diabetic medication other than metformin.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It's not entirely our fault. The guidance we're given is pretty hopeless, suggests a 2012 paper published in the journal Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, which reviewed scientific studies into portion size and all the official advice.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For instance, we're told to eat two portions of oily fish a week, but not how much that actually is. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Even the NHS's 'Eat Well plate' - a visual tool showing a plate divided up according to food groups - doesn't specify exact amounts, only rough proportions. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It says we should eat 'plenty' of vegetables, 'plenty' of starchy carbs such as pasta and rice, 'some' protein such as chicken and fish, 'some' milk and dairy and 'just a small amount' of fat and sugar. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And while fruit or vegetable portion sizes are specified - 80g is one of your five a day, says the NHS - even if you could work out what 80g of broccoli would look like, what about 80g of spinach or 80g of blueberries </font></p><img id="i-fccff7af890bcef3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/11/23/22/11F96A13000005DC-3331095-image-a-1_1448317022168.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Apart from the fact that you should have five 80g servings of fruit and veg a day, there are currently no official UK guidelines on portion sizes - or rules for food manufacturers to tell us what counts as a serving" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">What's more, nutritional content and serving size on packaging is listed in grams, yet few of us bother weighing out food.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">So how can you work out how much to eat, without calorie-crunching or taking scales to the supermarket?</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Good Health has the answer at hand - literally.
