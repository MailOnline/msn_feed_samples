That's the view of his Barcelona team-mate Ivan Rakitic, whose Croatia side will face Messi and Co at the upcoming World Cup.

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brighton and West Brom, his main potential suitors, have the capacity to offer him remuneration likely to be beyond Celtic's reach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For former Celtic skipper Tom Boyd, though, the player's choice is becoming abundantly clear.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'What do you want to be as a player?' he asked. 'Do you want to be a winner? Or do you want to just earn good money?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I really hope Stuart can stay at Celtic. We don't want our best players leaving.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I know in the grand scheme of things there's a big gap between the Scottish Premiership and the English Premiership. And he clearly has a decision to make.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But I don't want to see Stuart go. Hopefully we can get him to stay - a five year contract would be nice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think he's a happy man at Celtic. He'll win things there.' His medal haul to date isn't too shabby, though. Four titles, two Scottish Cups, two League Cups - have all been attained in three-and-a-half years.</p><img id="i-b3b31d529ca196aa" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D25431500000578-0-image-a-26_1528761173837.jpg" height="415" width="634" alt="Former Celtic skipper Tom Boyd has urged the 26-year-old to stay at Celtic Park" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps, for Celtic, therein lies the problem. Success may not have come easy to the former Dundee United player but he's enjoyed it so quickly and to such an extent that he might feel the need for a challenge elsewhere.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And if it comes to pass that the player and his current paymasters come to an amicable agreement, shake hands and move on, Boyd feels the depth of the squad he'd leave behind would cope.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Celtic are well covered in the midfield areas,' he said. 'If something was to happen, that Stuart decides to leave, then we've certainly got a lot of other options.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We've got good players in there; (Callum) McGregor and (Tom) Rogic - similarly attack minded boys.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But, we don't want a player like that to leave and what he brings to the football club. He's got great drive and ability and we'd rather see him here.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'At the moment, where it lies, if somebody was to come in and make a good offer then there needs to be serious consideration.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But he's still a Celtic player and hopefully he will stay a Celtic player.' Brendan Rodgers could certainly do with Armstrong remaining on board at least for the duration of the Champions League qualifiers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Set to face the first of four hurdles on July 10/11, the Celtic manager faces an appreciably tougher task to take his side into the group stages than in the past two years.</p><img id="i-e69ead556ac9b5aa" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D231F1100000578-0-image-m-23_1528760727496.jpg" height="819" width="634" alt="Boyd hopes the Scottish champions can keep ahold of Armstrong and offer him a new deal" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There's so much against Celtic in terms of qualifying,' Boyd offered.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They've now got four rounds to overcome and that's a massive ask.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Hopefully they do well. But we need all of the other Scottish clubs to get better. It helps the coefficient. Ultimately, that can stop Celtic from having to play four qualifying rounds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We need Scottish football to get better and I think the signs are there we can.' With Steven Gerrard in at Rangers, Alan Stubbs the new manager of St Mirren, and Neil Lennon, Steve Clarke and Derek McInnes remaining in charge at Hibs, Kilmarnock and Aberdeen, Boyd envisages the forthcoming domestic campaign being compelling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The competition in the league is improving,' he said. 'I know Celtic are still the strongest side but things are getting better.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The Steven Gerrard factor is unknown at the moment. Hearts should also be better. Hibs did ever so well last year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So we hope Scottish football can keep on the rise and get the country back on the map in terms of Europe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We've seen it so many times in recent years, clubs being knocked out in the first round of qualifiers; clubs from countries like Estonia and even last year, Luxembourg.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'To get better, to stop us having so many qualifiers, we need to achieve better results. It means everybody - it can't just be one team delivering.' </p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">GOALS' summer Football Revolution campaign aims to get more people active through playing five-a-side football during the World Cup and beyond. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">For further information: www.goalsfootball.co.uk [http://www.goalsfootball.co.uk]</span></p><div>

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">One judge saw it 117-111 to Flanagan, the other to Hooker by the same lopsided margin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What makes that even more troubling is that this was a reasonably close fight. How any official could give nine of the 12 rounds to either Flanagan or Hooker defies the eyesight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would have been worse had the third man at ringside failed to separate them.</p><img id="i-c2c9b946cf1e6c10" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/23/4D18AA1400000578-5832681-image-a-23_1528756484141.jpg" height="393" width="634" alt="Hooker falls to the ground after winning the world super-lightweight championship fight" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">A draw would not have been as scandalous as that gifted to Canelo Alvarez when he was clearly defeated by Gennady Golovkin in Las Vegas last year but still it would have been a blot on the record books.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A similar stench of home-town judging would have filled the night air. As it was, the judge who erred so widely in Flanagan's favour was seated adjacent to his corner and may have been influenced by the cheerleading from his seconds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the record, the decisive card coincided with my 115-113 in favour of Hooker.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Furthermore, Mighty Mo complained that UK referee Terry O'Connor had failed to deduct points for Turbo Terry's flagrant use of both head and elbow in his desperation to rattle a more skilled opponent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He has a point, but as it happened Flanagan was the one who suffered most physically. The gashes sustained beside his right eye and deep into his forehead in the seventh round were self-inflicted by his own butting tendency.</p><img id="i-f6b4723b3dcbbd4a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/23/4D18928300000578-5832681-image-a-22_1528756457862.jpg" height="398" width="634" alt="The gash deep into his forehead was self-inflicted by Flanagan's own butting tendency" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">To his credit Flanagan made no protest when the result was announced and he seemed to accept the verdict when admitting later that he would have to improve following his move up from lightweight in hope of becoming a two-division world champion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His promoter Frank Warren's only complaint was this: 'We cannot keep having these off-the-scale scorecards in boxing. This is bad for the sport.' This follows the ludicrous seven-point margin by which Nevada's myopic serial offender Adalaide Byrd fantasised that Canelo had beaten Triple G.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Flanagan is pleading for a rematch but although Hooker made sympathetic noises that is unlikely to happen. The American stylist is heading for the next World Super Series tournament which begins in September.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hooker also regards Flanagan as 'the dirty fighter we expected him to be.' No wonder that if a rematch ever comes, he is insisting that it would have to take place in his native Texas.</p><img id="i-37b090320f1c4e1d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/23/4D18B5C200000578-5832681-image-a-24_1528756577821.jpg" height="517" width="634" alt="Hooker is insisting that should there be a rematch it would have to take place in Texas" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The man mountain is going to the messiah.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tyson Fury will sail from his show-boating in Manchester across the Irish Sea to Belfast, where he will join forces with the spiritual leader of Ulster boxing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The gypsy giant is coming to the aid of Carl Frampton on August 18.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The icon of the Northern Ireland ring has dreamed of fighting in the Windsor Park national football ground but circumstances have conspired against him bidding to regain a world title on that optimum date there.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead of Leo Santa Cruz, who reneged on his promise of a Belfast rematch with the Jackal from whom he won the WBA featherweight title, or Lee Selby, who lost his IBF belt to Josh Warrington, Frampton is likely to face unbeaten Australian Luke Jackson.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That would not be a name likely to help Frampton fill Windsor Park to its projected 24,000 capacity for boxing.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shearer was at the peak of his powers when Robson succeeded Ruud Gullit at St James' Park in 1999 and recalled this week: 'If it wasn't for him I would have left the football club.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'That was the reality of the situation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He saved my career. I didn't know where to go, what to do, what I was doing right and what I was doing wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He instantly came in and saved my Newcastle career.' Shearer's revelation comes in a new film about Sir Bobby. Called 'Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager' it charts the life and career about one of English football's most revered characters.</p><img id="i-5a7f5b6e5533e0b7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/23/006150711000044C-0-image-a-41_1528755368250.jpg" height="408" width="634" alt="Shearer and Robson won the player and manager of the month awards for October 2003" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shearer had only been at Newcastle three years when Robson walked in.

Robson - the manager who took England to the semi-finals of the 1990 World Cup - spent five years in charge of Newcastle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The day of his first game game in charge, Newcastle beat Sheffield Wednesday 8-0.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shearer recalled: 'I scored five goals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We were back on the right track and it was all thanks to Bobby.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He had an aura about him.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">One last training session, or more of a training match, on the Sir Bobby Charlton pitch at St George’s Park on Monday and <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/sport/england_football/index.html">England’s</a> preparation before departing for the <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/sport/world-cup-2018/index.html">World Cup</a> was complete.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was an 11 v 11 exercise with Anthony Taylor as referee but, insisted the FA, it bore little correlation to what Gareth Southgate has in mind for that opening group match with <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/tunisia/index.html" id="mol-eb1313f1-6dbe-11e8-82cc-a3fc1ab1c92a">Tunisia</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Players switched between the opposing teams in black and white bibs, with England’s manager making a point of giving everyone game time. Even Jake Livermore, who deserves great credit for remaining part of the build-up despite not being picked for the flight to <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/russia/index.html" id="mol-eb1313f0-6dbe-11e8-82cc-a3fc1ab1c92a">Russia</a>, was involved.</p><img id="i-7cb0abf11beb7226" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/21/4D238C0700000578-5832249-image-a-16_1528747438395.jpg" height="443" width="634" alt="England put in their final training session at St Georges Park on Monday before the World Cup" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">For Southgate it was a chance to explore different combinations for the contrasting challenges that face his side in Group G, starting with that match against Tunisia on what promises to be a particularly warm night in Volgograd.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If England really aren’t too concerned by the prospect of meeting a north African team in temperatures on the sweatier side of 30 degrees there must be great confidence in their ability to dictate the pace of the game.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over the years it has not been one of England’s strengths. But Southgate takes encouragement not just from recent performances against Nigeria and Costa Rica, and the win over Holland in Amsterdam in March, but what he has been seeing in training on a daily basis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The style is clear,’ said Southgate. ‘We’ve selected players who can use the ball and I have to say the level of training is incredibly high at the moment.</p><img id="i-bd94065a617d36f0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/21/4D238BDC00000578-5832249-image-m-17_1528747440488.jpg" height="429" width="634" alt="The Three Lions are preparing to face Tunisia in their opening fixture of the tournament" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘What people have seen is the way we want to play. We want to be an intelligent team in terms of tactical approach and dealing with different stages in games.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It’s a great challenge. All the players can use the ball well, so when we are defending against pressing it’s very difficult to win the ball back.

It was an 11 v 11 exercise with Anthony Taylor as referee but, insisted the FA, it bore little correlation to what Gareth Southgate has in mind for that opening group match with Tunisia. Players switched between the opposing teams in black and white bibs, with England’s manager making a point of giving everyone game time.

The foreign appointments, Sven Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello, were short-term and results-based. Steve McClaren was a prevaricator who abandoned his thoughts of revolution after one setback in Croatia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Roy Hodgson’s occasional boldness seemed forced, as if his heart wasn’t really in it. Sam Allardyce failed to launch. Southgate is different. More adventurous, braver than many believed, with a clear sense of where he wants this team to be heading. We know what he is working towards, even if he may not have the personnel yet to deliver it.</p><div>

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">And he makes sense, too, off the field, as well as on. It is not just his style of play that has earned plaudits, but his style of management. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The way he has gently, but firmly, ushered several big names out of the picture without everything around him bursting into flames, the way he has redirected the many random missiles launched his way, from controversial tattoos to government interventions and talk of boycotts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is a well-worn line that managing England is an impossible job — another documentary with that title is scheduled for next weekend — but Southgate is bucking that cliche with simple reason. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Capello lost his way as the 2010 tournament approached, trying to bring players out of retirement and signing up for a counter-productive commercial opportunity, but Southgate grows more impressively measured and focused with each outing.</p><img id="i-e7166f814221bd45" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/19/04272076000007D0-0-image-a-24_1528741387007.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The Three Lions boss was bolder than most expected, phasing out big name Wayne Rooney" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He resists bandwagons and populist trends, he skirts traps. He is so much more than a nice guy, or a company stooge. Increasingly, he is a man who inspires faith and confidence: a truly admirable figurehead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, this means little if England fail to emerge from the group.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Southgate is not here to play the World Cup in theory. There has to be finite, tangible progress in Russia; a genuine sense that things are better than before. Southgate can be articulate in front of a microphone and progressive on the tactics board, he can be convincing in public and popular with his players, but if England fail to get past Tunisia and Panama, he is going to be a hard sell for next season.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet if the worst was to happen, even if it renders his position untenable, he is likely to escape without being turned into a vegetable or a wally.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why? We’re in it with him. His views are our views. The media, large swathes of the public, the professional game. What he is doing is widely understood and supported, eminently rational and rooted in logic. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The phasing out of Wayne Rooney, dropping Joe Hart and Jack Wilshere, playing three at the back, moving Raheem Sterling nearer to Harry Kane, reinventing Kyle Walker to make room for Kieran Trippier — these are arguments that make sense and have, largely, come off.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His looser discipline, the room he allows his players, the responsibility he affords them, fighting the battles he can win, existing comfortably with those he can’t — in his man-management methods Southgate epitomises the change in international strategy. </p><img id="i-6594749c65fe8d08" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/22/0690A5D0000003E8-5832239-Southgate_has_a_plan_in_mind_and_wasn_t_afraid_to_leave_the_like-a-9_1528752281216.jpg" height="475" width="634" alt="Southgate has a plan in mind and wasn't afraid to leave the likes of Jack Wilshere at home" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">After Capello, who now believes an old-school disciplinarian would work? Had the Italian lasted until the 2012 European Championship, even he would undoubtedly have adjusted the thinking that sucked the life out of England’s group in South Africa.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet while Capello may have evolved into a better England manager for his first tournament experience, he was never going to be greatly interested in England’s production line. Like Eriksson, he had better things to do than study the Under 21s, or the teenagers below.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Allardyce talked of introducing a new name to the England ranks in 2016, he meant manipulating the international rules to pick Steven Nzonzi, who is French. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How short-sighted was that? As a former age-group coach, Southgate, one feels, is engaged and committed to the pathway in a way many predecessors simply were not. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Only Nigeria have a younger squad at this World Cup — yet England may still be youthful in 2020 or 2022 if Southgate remains in charge, and new faces continue to be added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The potential of youth is hard to tame. So this is not to say nothing will go wrong, or could go wrong for England in Russia. Tunisia are organised and lively and will be tricky first-game opponents. England cannot afford an off-day in the heat of Volgograd on Monday.</p><img id="i-b496599748316dbc" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/22/3677C3F500000578-5832239-Previous_managers_like_Fabio_Capello_lost_their_way_as_a_big_tou-a-10_1528752281276.jpg" height="550" width="634" alt="Previous managers like Fabio Capello lost their way as a big tournament approached" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet the main reason to hope all goes to plan is that progress to the last 16, or beyond — and there is no reason England cannot reach the last eight here — should secure another two years of Southgate’s vision, at least. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With more good young players coming from the age-group teams, perhaps England will be better placed to carry out plans first visualised in Russia at the 2020 European Championship.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After so much inconsistency of thought, English football could do with more of Southgate’s calm-inducing logic. Clarity and optimism have hardly been our default settings, after all. </p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><strong>Why Wembley is ideal</strong></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">These days, the script dictates that Wembley is corporate and dull and England would be much better eschewing the national stadium for the provinces. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The atmosphere at Elland Road last week was certainly noisy. The many tributes, however, overlooked one salient fact — England’s Manchester United players, Marcus Rashford and Phil Jones, and later substitute Jesse Lingard, were booed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not with great venom or for a prolonged period, but loudly enough to be noticeable and without the players doing anything to provoke it. They just had to be present and play for Manchester United.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it didn’t matter because this was a friendly, England were quickly on top and Rashford was outstanding from the start.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It will not, however, always be that way. If Wembley is sold and England do have to play some home matches on the road each season, they will not all be strolls like Thursday’s game. There will be occasions when England are poor, or struggling, have a difficult qualifying group or desperately need a win.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meaning there will be occasions when fans arrive dissatisfied. Football has moved on since England were last on a domestic tour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is more than a decade since the national team returned to Wembley and the English game has grown considerably more tribal in that time. Fans are defined by who they despise as much as those they love. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the ska anthem Liquidator by Harry J. All Stars is played at Stamford Bridge now, the locals chant about hating Tottenham before they even mention Chelsea. It is ridiculous.</p><img id="i-e7021641d4e628e0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/22/4CDAA49600000578-5832239-Wembley_stadium_is_an_ideal_home_for_England_with_the_full_backi-a-11_1528752281285.jpg" height="357" width="634" alt="Wembley Stadium is an ideal home for England with the full backing of the crowd" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, the idea that England’s players will be welcomed, supported and garlanded in the provinces is presumptuous. If that had been England needing to win against Belgium last week and Jones had been skinned by Eden Hazard as he was at Wembley on FA Cup final day, Elland Road could have turned very inhospitable. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wembley might not be ideal — but it is largely a safe space. </p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><strong>Vieira is moving in the right direction</strong></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ideally, the satellite clubs of the City Football Group feed the biggest of them all, Manchester City. So Aaron Mooy is recruited by Melbourne City, impresses, is signed by Manchester City and eventually by Huddersfield. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His career path is straightforward, either way. He makes the grade in Manchester, or their status secures him a career elsewhere in England, for an enhanced fee. It’s a win-win for club and player.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The same should apply to managers, but it is more complex. Patrick Vieira’s experience with New York City could prepare him to succeed Pep Guardiola in Manchester one day. </p><img id="i-e20f1ec51ef62ace" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/22/4D23981400000578-5832239-Patrick_Vieira_made_a_step_up_the_managerial_ladder_this_week_jo-a-12_1528752281289.jpg" height="442" width="634" alt="Patrick Vieira made a step up the managerial ladder this week, joining Nice from New York City" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet until the standard of Major League Soccer improves, little comes guaranteed. Would Manchester City take a chance on a coach whose sole position was in MLS? Probably not. Bob Bradley is the only American to manage a Premier League side and his time at Swansea did not end well.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So Vieira has done the right thing, swapping New York for Nice. A successful time in Ligue 1 or beyond will give him experience of coaching in a major European league, while his years in New York maintain the connection with City. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As long as he has departed on good terms — and there is nothing to suggest otherwise — leaving may actually enhance his chances of becoming Manchester City manager one day. </p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><strong>Window shutting on Villa's Grealish plan</strong></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aston Villa <span style="font-size: 16px;">hope to wring £40million from the sale of Jack Grealish this summer, to stave off economic oblivion.

Delph emerged as a key player for Pep Guardiola’s side last season — culminating in his selection for the World Cup — and the 28-year-old says two lifestyle choices were integral to his form.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Danny Gallagher</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T22:49:33.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Fabian Delph reveals meditation is the secret to his success</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T22:49:33.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>World Cup 2018,Manchester City,England Football</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5831231/France-1998-World-Cup-champions-reunite-celebrate-20th-anniversary-3-0-victory-Brazil.html" title="Zinedine Zidane leads the celebrations as France's 1998 superstars reunite to mark the 20th anniversary of historic World Cup win over Brazil"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5831559/Griezmann-Pogba-Mbappe-Frances-training-session-Russia.html" title="Antoine Griezmann, Paul Pogba and Kylian Mbappe take part in France's first training session in Russia ahead of World Cup opener against Australia"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5763335/England-face-long-road-World-Cup-glory-having-travel-9-300-miles.html" title="England face a long road to World Cup glory with over NINE THOUSAND miles on the clock to reach the Moscow final... the same distance from the UK to Australia!

It was the first time we didn’t see him eat!’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The dream was not realised. In retrospect that camp was a sliding doors moment.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">First things first. To be at The Grange on Sunday was a joy.

<br />
</div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><strong></strong><strong>1) Play the situation</strong><strong></strong></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The defeat in Edinburgh raises serious issues for an England side who simply have to win the World Cup to justify the considerable investment in one-day cricket made by Andrew Strauss and, consequently, the decline in the Test team. England may have undergone a white-ball revolution but need to realise they cannot always hit their way out of trouble.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They must play the situation in front of them. Morgan said after the Scotland loss that they will learn from mistakes playing ‘their way’ but the dismissals of Jonny Bairstow and Moeen Ali when going so well showed they must be more intelligent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bairstow was brilliant in making his third straight one-day century but this time he had to go on and win the match. Moeen had salvaged the situation after England lost five wickets for 56 but then gave it away when all he had to do was play sensibly for the rest of the innings. The hard work was done: that’s what England do not seem to grasp.</p><img id="i-c4ea0751b13a451a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/20/054304C3000007D0-0-image-a-18_1528744185223.jpg" height="439" width="634" alt="Jonny Bairstow was brilliant against Scotland but this time he had to go on and win the match" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><strong></strong><strong>2) Don’t be dopey</strong><strong></strong></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Talking of intelligence, there was no greater lack of it than in the display of Alex Hales, who could be dropped when Ben Stokes returns.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He has been a key component in the rise of England’s white-ball cricket and has scored half-centuries in his last two innings but has the worst game-management of any England player.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was culpable in Joe Root’s run-out before inexplicably giving his wicket away the very next ball after Morgan was dismissed. It left two new batsmen at the crease at the worst possible time and was the personification of England’s mismanagement.</p><img id="i-9ebe7d899c5ede8a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/20/055EE3B7000003E8-0-image-m-20_1528744319646.jpg" height="447" width="634" alt="Alex Hales could be dropped when Ben Stokes returns due to his poor game management" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><strong></strong><strong>3) Bowlers need to get up to speed</strong><strong></strong></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, the Grange pitch was perfect for batting and yes, the boundaries were very short but there is no way the best one-day side in the world should allow the 13th-ranked team to score 371. Stokes and Chris Woakes were sorely missed but there was a lack of penetration and flat-wicket skills.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nobody was more worrying than Mark Wood, who is lacking the extreme pace that marked him out as England’s X-factor.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wood was still bowling around 85-87mph in Edinburgh but he is gun-barrel straight and does not get the bounce of, say, Liam Plunkett. If injuries have taken their toll and he cannot get back up to 90mph then he will struggle to sustain an international career.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also, giving up red-ball cricket to concentrate on white-ball did not appear immediately to benefit Adil Rashid.</p><img id="i-d6cc3701aba37bca" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/20/416AEB0A00000578-0-image-a-21_1528744423801.jpg" height="535" width="634" alt="Mark Wood is lacking the extreme pace that marked him out as England's X-factor" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><strong></strong><strong>4) Plan for life without Stokes and Woakes</strong><strong></strong></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no getting around it. The absence of Stokes causes chaos to the balance of all England sides. He is such a valuable cricketer with bat, ball and in the field that his injury leaves him sorely missed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But England have to get used to it. Various niggles and off-field problems are causing Stokes to miss an alarming amount of cricket and there is a danger that an all-rounder once destined for greatness is drifting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was pertinent, too, that Morgan should point out before the Scotland match just how slowly Woakes heals. We are unlikely to see him at all during the Australia series and it could be that striving for extra pace has taken its toll.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is the second summer running Woakes has gone down with injury and his overseas record renders him a home specialist now. It can only be hoped we haven’t already seen the best of him.</p><img id="i-c4cff470c428f956" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/22/06422434000003E8-5832431-Stokes_has_been_struggling_with_various_niggles_and_off_field_pr-a-23_1528754087423.jpg" height="428" width="634" alt="Stokes has been struggling with various niggles and off-field problems in recent times" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-4462c28f7490bdec" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/23/4D24494B00000578-5832431-image-a-26_1528754446606.jpg" height="397" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><strong></strong><strong>5) Make it count on flat tracks</strong><strong></strong></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps the biggest concern in Scotland was that the defeat came on a perfect batting pitch. It was exactly the sort of surface England have appeared capable of chasing anything on, let alone 372 against a sub-standard Scottish attack.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Record chase or not, they should have won.

</div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>PAUL NEWMAN: With England’s one-day series against the old enemy Australia starting on Wednesday, here are six issues they can address to get back on track ahead of next year’s World Cup on home soil. The defeat in Edinburgh raises serious issues for an England side who simply have to win the World Cup to justify the considerable investment in one-day cricket made by Andrew Strauss and, consequently, the decline in the Test team. England may have undergone a white-ball revolution but need to realise they cannot always hit their way out of trouble.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Jeorge Bird</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T23:01:07.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>England six-point plan to rule the world despite defeat to Scotland</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T23:01:07.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5822865/ECB-budget-cuts-scupper-England-young-guns.html" title="Budget cuts to scupper England young guns as pace programme and overseas placements are culled"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5827729/We-miles-needed-says-England-captain-Eoin-Morgan.html" title="'We were miles off where we needed to be': England captain Eoin Morgan admits side were humbled by Scotland"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5825281/Morgan-insists-England-never-embroiled-type-scandal-rocked-Australia.html" title="'The humility about the way we play cricket sets an example': Eoin Morgan insists that his England side would never become embroiled in type of cheating scandal that rocked Australia"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5823103/England-star-Jos-Buttler-expecting-Australia-aggressive.html" title="England star Jos Buttler expecting Australia to be as 'aggressive' as ever when old rivals clash for the first time since ball-tampering scandal"></link></item><item><title>Brad Shields has a habit of doing things differently: He could have been on his stag do in Auckland but made his England debut at Ellis Park instead</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/article-5832509/England-debutant-Brad-Shields-habit-doing-things-differently.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2018 21:30:02 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5832509</guid><description><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE: If things had worked out differently, Brad Shields would have been enjoying his belated stag do in Auckland last weekend.

He was also the Wellington Colleges’ all-rounder of the year.

Now, Shields is set to wear the Red Rose alongside those same players.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A professional contract with the Hurricanes was the next rung on the ladder. One of his greatest strengths is a remarkable engine. He finished first in the the club’s Surf to Peak challenge in pre-season: a gruelling race beginning with a a 1km sprint followed by a 21km cycle and finishing with a 2km climb to the top of Mount Victoria, the city’s highest point.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I always remember we were doing a fitness session in the Wellington academy,’ Kainga recalls.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Brad was just smoking everyone.

I’m going to win.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He seemed like Superman on that Monday afternoon when presented with the trophy but what a price he would pay. It would prove the last of his 14 major championship victories, as wondrous feats gave way to a heart-breaking divorce and its tawdry aftermath.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, he’s back again, marking the 10th anniversary as one of the favourites for this year’s edition at Shinnecock Hills.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Sitting here, I guess the 10 years have gone by quickly but there were certainly times when I wasn’t well when every second felt like 24 hours,’ said Woods last week. ‘I think there are four major victories that stand out for me because I didn’t miss a putt inside 10 feet at any of them — the 1997 Masters, the 2000 US Open (Pebble Beach), the 2000 Open (St Andrews), and Torrey. But the last one was when I needed to putt like that. I didn’t hit the ball anywhere near as well that week as the other three.’</p><img id="i-ab4428f8d8d83153" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/21/01A8AA5400000578-0-image-a-3_1528749943109.jpg" height="695" width="634" alt="Woods had arrived at Torrey Pines having played only nine holes since the Masters in April" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Is there anyone still out there who thinks he’s got no chance at Shinnecock, that people at 42 don’t suddenly remember how to win majors? If so, let’s rewind to five unforgettable days when he completed mission impossible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The drama began the Sunday before, when Woods realised he could not rest his ailing knee any longer. ‘I played Big Canyon down the road, the course I grew up on, and I was still trying to work out how I was going to play wearing a knee brace,’ recalled Tiger.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘So I shot 50-odd for nine holes doing that and, on the drive to Torrey I threw the brace in the trash and said to my trainer, “Now, I have to figure out how I am going to play without it”.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was no evidence he had solved the conundrum by the first hole, as he marked down a double-bogey six. Woods stumbled on to card 72 to lie four off the lead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I thought he would withdraw and was amazed when he turned up for the second round,’ said then USGA president Jim Vernon.</p><img id="i-404c0d713d0a75c7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/21/01A29B5F00000578-0-image-a-4_1528749947202.jpg" height="480" width="634" alt="Woods seemed like Superman on that Monday afternoon when presented with the trophy" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">On day two, jaws went slack as Woods came home in 30 shots for a 68 to lie tied second with Karlsson. ‘That was the moment when something rather magical began to unfold,’ said USGA chief executive Mike Davis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Day three has gone down as one of those ‘only Tiger’ days, when the pain was at its height and Karlsson had a ringside seat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘On the back nine he hit it so poor because the only way he could actually get through the ball with his knee was by hitting a massive slice off the tee,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘On the 15th he couldn’t do that because there was a tree on the left of the tee. He knew what was coming next. He said to me not to wait for him after he hit his drive. Now he stuck a perfect draw, the best shot he hit all day, but the cost was clear. He stood on the tee just hyperventilating. After I walked on he was still on the tee, trying to recover.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Woods hit it everywhere over that back nine. On the 13th his drive finished in a toilet. On the 14th he missed the fairway by 50 yards to the right. At the 17th he was short and in a horrible lie in two. None of it was reflected on his scorecard.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Everything went for him,’ said Karlsson. ‘He got a free drop from the toilet at the 13th and made an eagle. At the 17th he chipped in. At the 18th he was 80 feet away in two but by then we all knew what was going to happen. I remember watching his putt thinking, surely not, but it kept going and going and fell into the hole. Outside the Ryder Cup, the roar was the loudest I’ve ever heard.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet how could Tiger carry on? ‘That might have been the most incredible thing of all, that he came back for the fourth day,’ said Karlsson. Woods started with a double bogey, and followed it with a bogey. Again he wouldn’t give in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the agony went until he got to the 18th, needing a birdie to tie underdog Rocco Mediate, as did playing partner Lee Westwood. Clearly seething after leaving his own 20-foot downhill effort short, the Englishman couldn’t watch as Woods stood over his 15-footer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I didn’t need to watch anyway,’ recalled Westwood. ‘He always holes those putts, doesn’t he?’ One more putt duly dropped and, in a rare contrast of emotion, Woods’s face was creased with rapture, rather than pain. And back we came for a fifth day. Eighteen-hole play-offs staged on Mondays are usually anti- climactic, but not this one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Three shots behind with eight to play, Mediate benefited from bogeys from Woods at the 11th and 12th and then went ahead with birdies at 14 and 15. Once more, Woods needed a birdie at the 18th to tie; once more he delivered. Now it became sudden-death, and that was where Woods got his hands on the trophy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mediate sums up the week. ‘It was five days of controlled insanity,’ he said. ‘And it was the golf experience of a lifetime.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Two days later, Woods went into hospital to have his knee surgically rebuilt. It would be eight months before he reappeared, but he would never be the same player again. It was the debt owed for perhaps the most courageous US Open victory of all.</p><div>

By the time we got to the 17th, Tiger was struggling so badly I asked his caddie Steve Williams whether he thought he would even be able to play the final round, let alone think about winning.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Dave Wood</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T22:48:28.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Tiger's miracle: Woods played through pain barrier to win 2008 US Open</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T22:48:28.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>US Open Golf,Tiger Woods</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-5826471/US-Open-Golf-2018-Tournament-betting-odds-Shinnecock-Hills.html" title="US Open 2018 betting tips and odds: Dustin Johnson the 10/1 bookies' favourite, 35/1 Phil Mickelson seeking the slam and Tiger Woods hunting his 15th major - 10 years after No 14"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-5832357/Fairways-heaven-Rory-McIlroy-big-hitters-Open.html" title="Shinnecock Hills fairways are heaven for Rory McIlroy and the big hitters at the US Open"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-5791493/US-Open-2018-betting-favourites-Odds-form-guide-Tiger-Woods-Co.html" title="US Open 2018 betting favourites: Golf odds and form guide for Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Co ahead of year's second major at Shinnecock Hills"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-5785983/Tiger-Woods-not-won-major-10-years-care-more.html" title="Tiger Woods has not won a major for 10 years and Jack Nicklaus's record total now looks unbeatable... so why do we even care about him any more?"></link></item><item><title>Shinnecock Hills fairways are heaven for Rory McIlroy and the big hitters at the US Open</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-5832357/Fairways-heaven-Rory-McIlroy-big-hitters-Open.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2018 21:29:45 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5832357</guid><description><![CDATA[DEREK LAWRENSON - WORLD OF GOLF: Of all the surprises thrown at the game in recent years, the sight of generous fairways at Shinnecock Hills might well be the most unexpected.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">He added: ‘They look generous, and they will be if there’s no wind, but go and drop a ball in the rough and see what happens. If you miss them, you’ve got no chance.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">McIlroy has been here a week already and is having a ball. He’s played three other great courses in this privileged part of Long Island — the National, Sebonack and Friar’s Head — as well as a couple of twirls around Shinnecock.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘What a fantastic part of the world, and particularly at this time of year,’ he enthused. </p><img id="i-c1e7e09e86bee7fe" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/21/4D23E95200000578-0-image-m-24_1528748773031.jpg" height="435" width="634" alt="McIlroy and Spaniard Jon Rahm sign autographs for fans at Shinnecock Hills" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS sport" data-version="2" id="mol-00131fe0-6dbd-11e8-9883-c5a60f28595d">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">QUOTE OF THE WEEK</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘What a cool way to end the day and hole that shot on 18. A lot of good things happened this week. I knew coming in I was swinging really well and had a lot of confidence in my game. Now, it’s about doing it again at the US Open.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What a cool way to regain the world No 1 spot too, as Dustin Johnson closed out victory by six shots at the St Jude Classic on Sunday by holing his second shot from the fairway at the 18th. In so doing he displaced Justin Thomas at the summit. No player has ever claimed the US Open having won the week before but, given the fairly lenient Shinnecock Hills set-up, Johnson clearly has the opportunity to create history.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">For Monday’s round, McIlroy had Spaniard Jon Rahm for company. In between shots he consulted with former American Ryder Cup player Brad Faxon, who’s been advising him on his putting and in the process has become something of a mentor. He also picked the brains of three-time major champion Nick Price, who’s now a voice of sanity on the USGA’s executive committee.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like every other player, McIlroy spent an inordinate amount of time practising on the severely undulating greens. In the process, it was easy to see how the USGA got them so fast last time they became unfair. This was only Monday but from a position above the 18th green, McIlroy still knocked his first putt from 20 feet almost as far past the hole.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Nick was saying they will only get about a foot faster than this,’ he explained, referring to the added distance the ball would travel if the green had been cut to tournament speed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From the clubhouse nearby that sits majestically on a hill overlooking the course, it was a real thrill to look out on a venue with the feel of a traditional links on the other side of the Atlantic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This US Open might just prove a classic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-large">War on dawdlers gathers pace </span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thanks to everyone who emailed regarding last week’s column on slow play. There’s no question this is the most pressing issue to vex the mind of the average golfer, the single most off-putting thing about the modern game.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, have we seen a real breakthrough at last? What happened over four days at the Shot Clock Masters in Austria was positively eye-opening. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A low-key European Tour event that normally receives next to no coverage deservedly drew widespread praise all around the world, with No 1 Dustin Johnson leading the resounding applause.</p><img id="i-f20078efe339151" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/22/4D24603300000578-5832357-image-m-33_1528752811347.jpg" height="418" width="634" alt="World No 1 Dustin Johnson backed the European Tour initiative against slow play" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just look at the startling figures. Thanks to the players being timed on every shot, rounds were reduced by more than 30 minutes over the previous year. In round four, the field was taking less than three and- a-half hours to play 18 holes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The golf was better too, because the pros didn’t have time to dawdle and second-guess themselves. The scoring average of 72.24 was more than a full shot better than previous editions at the venue in question, Diamond Country Club. The next test, of course, is to make it work at an event where all the top players, who are used to getting their own way, are competing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But you sense the European Tour’s CEO Keith Pelley has got the bit between his teeth on this one. If the Canadian’s most lasting contribution proves a tour where everyone plays at a pace more respectful of their fellow competitors and the watching public, what a legacy it would be.</p><div>

</div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Ten years on from her startling win in the Wimbledon junior event, Laura Robson has admitted that she feels undeserving of a wildcard into next month's main draw singles. And even if she happened to be offered one of the precious privileged entries she would be inclined to turn it down. The 24 year-old lefthander has been hit by more injuries this season and her singles ranking has fallen to 333. It is leading her towards focussing more on doubles play, which sees her on a contrasting upward trajectory and on the cusp of the world's top 100.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Jeorge Bird</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T22:10:20.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Robson believes that she doesn't deserve Wimbledon wildcard</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T22:10:20.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Wimbledon</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-5830331/Rafael-Nadal-casts-doubt-playing-Wimbledon.html" title="Rafael Nadal casts doubt over playing at Wimbledon after 'mentally tough' clay court season ends at French Open"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-5824565/Simona-Halep-claims-maiden-Grand-Slam-fourth-attempt-clinches-French-Open-title.html" title="Simona Halep claims her maiden Grand Slam at the fourth attempt as she clinches French Open title with victory over American Sloane Stephens"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-5820993/Is-tennis-star-Sloane-Stephens-USA-striker-Jozy-Altidore-Americas-famous-power-couple.html" title="Is this America's upcoming sporting power couple?

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">James was outstanding once again during the 2018 playoffs as he carried an out-matched Cavaliers team to the Finals to set up a fourth straight meeting with the juggernaut Golden State Warriors. For the third time in four years, Cleveland lost. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was the eighth consecutive time James has reached the NBA Finals and the four-time MVP remains the undisputed king of the Eastern Conference. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But standing in his way now is the most dominant super team created in the modern era. In 2015 and 2016 the Warriors boasted two-time MVP Stephen Curry as well as All-Stars Draymond Green and Klay Thompson.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For 2017 and 2018 the Warriors added Kevin Durant, arguably the second best player in the NBA, and James' task transformed from daunting to nigh-on impossible. </p><img id="i-55005dac12d5d9e9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/18/4D12679F00000578-5830987-image-a-87_1528739582837.jpg" height="399" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-92bd1b1211ddd5ab" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/18/4D12486300000578-5830987-image-a-85_1528739444765.jpg" height="414" width="634" alt="James walks off the court during Game Four of the Finals for maybe the last time as a Cavalier" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">James has made two huge free agency decisions during his career already. He shocked the league by announcing he'd leave Cleveland to join Miami Heat in 2010 live on a TV show entitled 'The Decision', forming the first modern era super team.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After winning two NBA titles in four seasons with the Heat, James made an emotional return to Cleveland in 2014 and delivered on his promise by winning the Larry O'Brien Trophy for his hometown team in 2016 - defeating the Warriors in an epic seven-game Finals series. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Warriors' dominance has left the rest of the league desperately seeking to arm themselves in order to halt Golden State's relentless run of success. Where James chooses could shift the balance of the NBA entirely.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At 33 years old, this will be the last free agency decision he will make while still at the peak of his career, the last opportunity he has to shape his legacy and his standing among the very greatest to play the game.</p><img id="i-77c215b0ce03acc5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/18/4D112C1500000578-5830987-image-a-89_1528739593999.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="LeBron was outstanding all post-season for the Cavaliers as he carried Cleveland to the Finals" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">All 30 of the NBA teams will likely make their pitch to James but only a handful will be given serious consideration by the four-time MVP. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cleveland remain serious contenders to recapture their prodigal son for another stretch. The bond James holds with the Cavaliers remains strong, strong enough for him to return in 2014 despite the despicable treatment he received from owner Dan Gilbert and sections of the fans.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But after delivering the city's first major sports title in 52 years in 2016, James might feel he has now honoured his duty to his hometown franchise. Looking at the Cavaliers' roster, he could also be forgiven for wanting a little more help having almost single-handedly dragged them to the Finals this post-season.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The bookies favour James making the move out west to the glamour of the Los Angeles Lakers.

James will become an unrestricted free agent on July 1 when he opts out of his Cleveland Cavaliers deal, meaning he is able to sign with any team he chooses. Still the NBA's best player, where James picks as his next destination could shape the future of the league for the next five seasons.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Danny Gallagher</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-12T09:11:47.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>LeBron James's free agency decision will shape the NBA's future</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-12T09:11:47.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>NBA,Lebron James</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nba/article-5824303/LeBron-James-reveals-Cleveland-future-uncertain-claims-played-broken-hand.html" title="LeBron James reveals his future with Cleveland Cavaliers is uncertain and claims he 'pretty much played the last three games with a broken hand'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-5822057/LeBron-James-potentially-play-final-game-Cleveland-Cavaliers.html" title="'How do you put together a group of talent and minds to compete with Golden State Warriors?' asks LeBron James as star gears up for potentially his last-ever Cleveland Cavaliers game"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nba/article-5823831/Golden-State-Warriors-blow-Cleveland-Cavaliers-away-4-0-whitewash-claim-successive-NBA-titles.html" title="Golden State Warriors blow Cleveland Cavaliers away with 4-0 whitewash to claim successive NBA titles... as Cavs star man LeBron James reveals he played last three games with BROKEN hand"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nba/article-5815475/Golden-State-Warriors-one-victory-successive-NBA-titles.html" title="Golden State Warriors close to successive NBA titles with third-straight play-offs victory over Cleveland Cavaliers as Kevin Durant scores 43 points"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22281387/golden-state-warriors-play-lebron-james" title="Golden State Warriors could be in play for LeBron James"></link></item><item><title>'I couldn't have hoped for a better opportunity': Manchester City assistant coach Domenec Torrent leaves to manage New York City FC</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5831845/Manchester-City-assistant-manager-Domenec-Torrent-leaves-post-coach-New-York-City-FC.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2018 18:06:01 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5831845</guid><description><![CDATA[Manchester City assistant manager Domenec Torrent has left his position at the Etihad Stadium to become New York City FC's new manager following Patrick Vieira's move to Ligue 1 side Nice.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Crowley, the retained jockey for owner Sheik Hamdan Al Maktoum, broke his silence on Monday and is particularly aggrieved at reported comments attributed to Da Silva which portrayed Crowley as the aggressor in an incident which left him with a cut on his face and swollen lip. Crowley said he had been the victim of an 'unprovoked attack' and believed he had been struck from behind with a piece of lead.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Kate McGreavy</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T19:02:34.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Crowley breaks silence on bust-up between himself and Raul Da Silva</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T19:02:34.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/racing/article-5823207/Grand-National-winning-trainer-Lucinda-Russell-awarded-OBE-Queens-Birthday-Honours-List.html" title="Grand National winning trainer Lucinda Russell awarded an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours List"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/racing/article-5823163/Justify-12th-horse-win-Triple-Crown.html" title="Justify out to become only the 12th horse to win the US Triple Crown"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/racing/article-5811483/Gold-Cup-winner-Denman-dies-aged-18.html" title="'He was a magic horse': 2008 Gold Cup winner Denman dies aged 18 as trainer Paul Nicholls says he was 'put to sleep painlessly'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/racing/article-5801845/Study-Man-wins-French-derby-Prix-du-Jockey-Club-Chantilly.html" title="Study Of Man wins French derby in the Prix du Jockey Club at Chantilly "></link></item><item><title>Manchester United to face Bayern Munich away in final pre-season test</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5831895/Manchester-United-face-Bayern-Munich-away-final-pre-season-test.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2018 17:48:44 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5831895</guid><description><![CDATA[Manchester United will wrap up their summer programme with a friendly against Bayern Munich in Germany on August 5.

The double European champion is set to make his first studio appearance on Friday when Spain open their Group B campaign against neighbours Portugal at the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>George Flood</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T16:29:26.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Chelsea's Fabregas joins star-studded BBC punditry team for World Cup</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T16:29:26.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>World Cup 2018,Chelsea</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5825735/John-Motson-admits-knife-edge-commentating.html" title="John Motson admits he was always on a 'knife-edge' when commentating as he says he will phone Guy Mowbray to wish him the best ahead of England's first World Cup match against Tunisia"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5825371/Battle-TV-teams-BBC-ITVs-punditry-presenting-line-ups-rated-World-Cup.html" title="Battle of the TV teams: BBC and ITV's punditry line-ups rated ahead of battle for World Cup viewers"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5825323/Mottys-magic-moments-Legendary-commentator-shares-five-favourite-World-Cup-memories.html" title="Motty's magic moments: Legendary commentator shares his five favourite World Cup memories "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5825197/Glenn-Hoddles-10-World-Cup-group-games-not-miss.html" title="Glenn Hoddle's 10 World Cup group games not to miss... from Portugal's clash with Spain to England's encounter with Belgium"></link></item><item><title>COMPETITION: Win tickets to England v Australia at the Oval - courtesy of Hardys Wine</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5829889/COMPETITION-Win-tickets-England-v-Australia-Oval.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2018 12:42:18 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5829889</guid><description><![CDATA[MailOnline has teamed up with Hardys Wine, official wine partner of England Cricket, to give you the chance to win one of two pairs of tickets to England v Australia at the Kia Oval.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The Indianapolis 500 is one of the world’s greatest sports events.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">To explore the possibility, Brown traveled to Detroit at the start of the month.

The build-up is American razzmatazz at its most extravagant and the race itself is a thrill-a-minute ride on the edge. So it was an unforgettable privilege to be at the Motor Speedway for the 2017 edition, in which Fernando Alonso excelled. We saluted Zak Brown and co at McLaren's vision in taking themselves across the Atlantic to renew Formula One’s long but broken association with the race. However, those memories do nothing to assuage my fear that McLaren are badly mistaken in contemplating full-time involvement in IndyCar.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Matt Smith</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T13:04:53.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>McLaren must get their F1 house in order before they leap into IndyCar</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T13:04:53.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-5829013/Ex-champion-Nico-Rosberg-tells-Sportsmail-make-F1-exciting.html" title="'We need as many teams competing at the top end as possible': Nico Rosberg on making F1 more exciting, Daniel Ricciardo to Mercedes rumours and his new drink-driving campaign"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-5827717/Five-things-missed-Canadian-Grand-Prix.html" title="Chequered flag blunder costs Daniel Ricciardo, while Hector Bellerin suffers double snub...

Think back over the past few years where we've had 'putting on broccoli' at Chambers Bay or Dustin Johnson not knowing his score with a few holes to play. That was at Oakmont two years ago when DJ's score was in fact the winning one and he's favourite this week at no better than 10/1. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Familiar faces are next in the betting and we'll get to them in a bit but what about Mickelson? He's out with McIlroy and Spieth on Thursday and Friday and available at 35/1 (Betfred) or 30/1 with Paddy Power, who, along with Coral are paying out on 10 places.</p><div>

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since winning the 2013 Open at Muirfield, Lefty's come up miles short in his three runs at trying to become the sixth man to complete the set (he missed last year as his daughter was graduating) but one of his six appearances as a bridesmaid in America's national championship was at Shinnecock in 2004.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He must have nightmares about that one, occupying pole position following birdies at 15 and 16 on the Sunday before three-putting from five feet for double-bogey at 17 and losing by two to Retief Goosen. They were the only two players to finish under par and the average fourth-round score was 78.7 on a day when 27 players failed to break 80. </p><img id="i-a0243124b4dcd1c9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/10/4D0579E000000578-5826471-image-a-7_1528709079693.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Mickelson on the 17th during the final round at Shinnecock Hills in 2004 - it didn't end well" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">We're 14 years down the line and the course has been stretched almost 500 yards to 7,445 but there's a case to be made for Mickelson. He's been back in the winner's enclosure at the WGC-Mexico, has five top-six finishes in 2018 and finished just outside the top 10 in Memphis at the weekend after opening with a 66 and closing with a 65 having played himself out of contention with a 73 on Saturday. Although from California, he's a popular player on the east coast and will be a fan favourite on the far end of Long Island.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At 30/1 and a fifth of the odds for 10 places - there's certainly worse bets. But are there better? At a track like Shinnecock, a proper US Open test, the cream should rise to the top.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">DJ hasn't quite been at the same level as he was between Oakmont and August the following year when he was winning for fun but, after recovering from injury he kicked off 2018 with a victory and may have timed this run to perfection with a dominant display to claim the St Jude Classic and take back the world No 1 spot. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was widely available at 10/1 to claim a second US Open before Sunday's sizzling 66 but only a couple of firms still offer double figures with most bookies trimming him to 8/1 or 9/1. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like Mickelson, Johnson will love the linksy feel of Shinnecock Hills.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The man he replaced at the top of the world rankings, Justin Thomas, will be keeping him company for the first two rounds with Tiger Woods making up one of several showbiz threeballs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thomas and Rickie Fowler shot 65s at Shinnecock last year, when it was set up for fun, not a US Open he was quick to point out, and Justin certainly has the iron play to get at the smallish greens. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He's 14/1 after five top-10s in his last nine events, including his win at the Honda Classic, while McIlroy, with memories of failing big Sunday tests at Augusta and Wentworth still fresh, is the same odds. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Woods, 20/1 with a couple of firms, has already caused a stir by mooring his $20m yacht in the Hamptons not far from Shinnecock. He's made more than a few waves since returning from the successful fusion surgery on his back but his driving (there were familiar struggles earlier in the year) will need to keep improving for him to have any chance of winning a 15th major 10 years after No 14. </p><img id="i-aa4a81b0f2bb5aa" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/10/01A2E15700000578-5826471-image-m-6_1528709021963.jpg" height="418" width="634" alt="It is a decade since Tiger Woods last got his hands on one of the games biggest prizes" class="blkBorder img-share" />                            <div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatLHS sport" data-version="2" id="mol-6f51a1c0-6d67-11e8-be99-7d5fc3e3c202">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">US OPEN TOP PICKS </h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dustin Johnson <strong>10/1</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rickie Fowler <strong>20/1</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Phil Mickelson <strong>35/1</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Martin Kaymer <strong>150/1 </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><span class="class"><span class="mol-style-italic">From <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://oddschecker.com/">oddschecker.com</a> - check e/w places with bookies</span></span><strong> </strong></p>                            </div>                        </div>                            <div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatLHS sport" data-version="2" id="mol-6f528c20-6d67-11e8-be99-7d5fc3e3c202">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">BEST OF THE REST </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dustin Johnson 1st-round leader <strong>16/1</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Branden Grace top-10 finish <strong>7/2 </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Branden Grace 1st-rnd leader <strong>40/1 </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Webb Simpson top-10 finish <strong>6/1</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><span class="class"><span class="mol-style-italic">From <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://oddschecker.com/">oddschecker.com</a> - Check e/w places (1st-rnd leader)</span></span><strong></strong></p>                            </div>                        </div>                        <p class="mol-para-with-font">His last outing was a T23 at the Memorial which would've been much better if his putter had been working but he said afterwards he was happy with where his game was in his build-up to this one. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Defending champion Brooks Koepka is around the same price and getting back in the groove having taken a couple of events to shake off the rust after recovering from a wrist injury. This trophy hasn't been retained since Curtis Strange in 1989 but Koepka certainly has the tools to do well while Masters champion Patrick Reed looks a bit big at 40/1.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Elsewhere, Fowler loves the course and at 20s appeals more than 18/1 shot Spieth, who has lost his mojo with the putter. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Americans hold all the major prizes right now but if that's about to change, Tommy Fleetwood (50/1) and Branden Grace (45/1) could have a big say. And Justin Rose will have plenty of backers too as a run of 20 tournaments since missing the cut at last year's USPGA has brought him four wins, 15 top 10s and 10 consecutive top 10s. There was a time, 2004 to be precise, when he hated this track but now he feels as happy with his ball-striking as he did five years ago - when he won at Merion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There hasn't been a major winner lower in the world rankings than 48 since 2011 when Darren Clarke (111) and Keegan Bradley (108) upset the odds but if you're looking for a long shot at Shinnecock, how about Martin Kaymer at 125/1. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He's without a win since this event four years ago but posted his first top-10 of the year at the Italian Open having held the lead at one point.</p><div>

The former Stormers forward attended the Springboks' impressive 42-39 comeback victory over England in Johannesburg on Saturday as a fan and has now remarkably been called up by director of rugby Rassie Erasmus before the penultimate match of the three-Test series, which takes place at the Toyota Stadium next weekend.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>George Flood</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T22:36:19.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Schalk Brits delays retirement as he is called into South Africa squad</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T22:36:19.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>England Rugby</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/article-5827443/England-conceded-14-tries-two-games-defence-unravels.html" title="Eddie Jones is on the ropes...

</div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW BY MATTHEW SMITH: The Canadian Grand Prix was the latest F1 race to attract criticism for a lack of action, and Nico Rosberg feels that having more teams in a position to battle for victory stands as the most viable tonic. Rosberg, who retired four days after winning his maiden F1 championship in 2016, has remained involved in the sport as a television pundit and commentator. It means he has had a first hand view of a 2018 season where, despite there being three different winners in the first seven racers and only one point separating Lewis Hamilton and leader Sebastian Vettel in the drivers' standings, the grands prix themselves have yet to truly capture the imagination.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Matt Smith</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T18:29:07.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Ex-champion Nico Rosberg tells Sportsmail how to make F1 more exciting</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T18:29:07.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-5827359/Sebastian-Vettel-cruises-victory-Montreal-win-Canadian-Grand-Prix.html" title="Sebastian Vettel cruises to victory in Montreal to win the Canadian Grand Prix and 50th of career as rival Lewis Hamilton surrenders Championship lead"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-5541479/F1-points-2018-Drivers-Constructors-table.html" title="F1 points 2018: Drivers and Constructors' table - Sebastian Vettel snatches championship lead off Lewis Hamilton following Canada victory"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-5827717/Five-things-missed-Canadian-Grand-Prix.html" title="Chequered flag blunder costs Daniel Ricciardo, while Hector Bellerin suffers double snub...

The Three Lions are based north west of Saint Petersburg throughout a group stage where they will be travelling more than many other teams during the tournament.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ben Nagle</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T18:17:16.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>England may face long road to World Cup glory by travelling 9,300miles</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T18:17:16.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>England Football,Mohamed Salah,World Cup 2018</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5779405/Raheem-Sterling-aiming-World-Cup-gun-rifle-tattoo.html" title="'I promised I would NEVER touch a gun': England star Raheem Sterling reveals assault rifle tattoo on his right leg is in tribute to his father who was shot dead when he was just two"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5780627/Harry-Kane-deserves-England-captain-Eric-Dier-insists-hes-not-disappointed.html" title="'Harry Kane deserves to be England captain': Eric Dier insists he's not disappointed at being overlooked"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5780303/Portugal-2-2-Tunisia-Visitors-prove-tough-beat-ahead-England-World-Cup-opener.html" title="Portugal 2-2 Tunisia: Visitors prove they are tough to beat ahead of England World Cup opener"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5780379/France-2-0-Republic-Ireland-Olivier-Giroud-Liverpool-target-Nabil-Fekir-score.html" title="France 2-0 Republic of Ireland: Olivier Giroud and Liverpool target Nabil Fekir score as Les Bleus' preparations for World Cup get off to the perfect start"></link></item><item><title>Tiger Woods has not won a major for 10 years and Jack Nicklaus's record total now looks unbeatable... so why do we even care about him any more?</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-5785983/Tiger-Woods-not-won-major-10-years-care-more.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2018 08:13:14 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5785983</guid><description><![CDATA[That heroic victory at Torrey Pines, 10 years ago now, took its toll.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">For so long it was a question of when, not if.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He had arrived even before most of the world had ever seen Him hit a ball, with Nike lighting the fuse by filming an ethnically diverse succession of children proclaiming 'I am <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/tiger_woods/index.html" id="mol-499cd8e0-6d4f-11e8-abf4-633a0f1a8db1">Tiger Woods</a>'. An explosive 12-shot win at the Masters aged just 21 then followed and it was clear: this would be the greatest golfer the world had ever seen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the years after his 1997 win at Augusta came even more extraordinary feats: a 15-shot winning margin in the US Open at Pebble Beach, the most destructive performance of all time; back-to-back triumphs at St Andrews; the career Grand Slam and then holding all four major titles at once - the 'Tiger Slam'; and winning the US Open on one leg, having played four rounds on a left tibia fractured in two places and with the ligaments in his left knee all but destroyed. That took Him within four majors of Jack Nicklaus's all-time record of 18, and still only at the age of 32.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But then it became a question of if, not when.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That heroic victory at Torrey Pines took its toll, leading to serious knee surgery. Back problems started to follow and, with each debilitating injury and subsequent operation it became apparent that He was human after all.</p><img id="i-586c2d5e3ac42280" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/10/0075BF2000000258-5785983-image-m-33_1527758252406.jpg" height="633" width="962" alt="Tiger Woods was a golfing phenomenon from a young age - here he is playing the Los Angeles Open in 1992 aged just 16" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-707f4acac98b64c1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/10/0001E29D00000258-5785983-image-a-27_1527758095589.jpg" height="658" width="962" alt="By the age of 21, Woods was the youngest ever Masters champion; his age and scoring record, set in 1997, remains unbeaten" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">An addiction to powerlifting in the gym and brutal training with Navy Seals - an obsession sparked by his adoration for his Green-Beret father, Earl, according to his former coach Hank Haney – had left his body broken and patched together by surgeons.</p><img id="i-f8597d98d1e8bbc4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/09/0796C551000005DC-5785983-image-a-7_1527756427645.jpg" height="684" width="470" alt="Woods's divorce from Elin Nordegren following the sex scandal of 2009 sparked a long and steep downfall" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was no surgery possible to save his marriage, however. The evening when it emerged that Woods, then the most high-profile sportsman in the world, had been 'seriously hurt' in a car accident sparked a frenzy of speculation and grave concern: What happened? What were his injuries? What does it mean for his playing career? Will he ever be the same again? Thankfully, his injuries turned out not to be as bad as first feared; but his life, and his career, were never the same again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The events of November 27, 2009 were more extraordinary than anyone had possibly imagined: at around 2.30am Woods had crashed his Cadillac Escalade SUV into a tree and fire hydrant near his home in Florida; he had been woken by his wife, Elin, after she had discovered text messages on his phone from another woman – a mistress; Elin had accused Woods of adultery and he fled, half-conscious due to the sleeping pills he had taken earlier; unfit to drive, he crashed; Elin chased after and attacked the car with, reportedly, a 9-iron.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The days that followed revealed Woods to be a serial cheater, with a bewildering array of waitresses, hostesses and porn stars claiming to have slept with him. In a matter of days, Woods's reputation degenerated from saintly to sleazy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He has not won a major championship since. </p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The sleaze scandal is, sadly, seemingly destined to be Woods's legacy among much of the public, who are, it must be said, not golf fans and so couldn't care less whether he wears a green jacket, red shirt or a yellow polka-dot bikini.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is hard to imagine now, given the past decade of playing decline and personal fall, just what fevered excitement Woods once generated. His domination over golf was absolute; his name and face were ubiquitous. The world and his mother knew all about Tiger Woods.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Woods spent 683 weeks ranked as the world's No 1 golfer – that's more than 13 years. In his prime he hit the ball further than any other player, he had more control and creativity with his irons than anyone, he had the best short game and his putting was, you guessed it, the best again. No-one has been able to hole as many crucial putts at the time when they were needed most; no-one has matched his mental fortitude or exhibited such a relentless thirst for victory; no-one has emitted such guttural roars or fist pumps that threatened to wrench an arm from its socket like he has.</p><img id="i-90198c7a9e967214" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/09/0505C001000007D0-5785983-image-a-1_1527756335184.jpg" height="795" width="962" alt="His raw emotional celebrations were a trademark, such as here after holing a putt to force a play-off in the 2008 US Open" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-2d28272abbd99e4f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/10/2EBBF5DC00000578-5785983-image-m-32_1527758198649.jpg" height="635" width="962" alt="After that win, his last major victory to date, a long string of debilitating injuries have derailed Woods's career" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The staggering lists of records he has set speak for themselves. As well as those combined 13 cumulative years as world No 1, Woods has won 79 PGA Tour events among 106 professional wins worldwide, including eight wins in a single year three times. In late 2006 and early 2007, he won seven consecutive tournaments, more than most top-level players manage in an entire career. In 2013, perhaps the only season post-scandal that he has been fully fit, he won five times.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More importantly, Woods is the only player ever to have won all four of the modern major championships consecutively – the famous Tiger Slam. He is the fifth and to date most recent player to complete the career Grand Slam of winning all four majors. Just ask Rory McIlroy, now aged 29 and struggling so desperately to get over the line at the Masters and join golf's most elite group. Tiger did it aged just 24 - and he has done it three times over, something only Nicklaus can match.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the age of 32, Woods was well on course to beat Nicklaus's major record, having won his 14th three years earlier than the Golden Bear had reached that number. Nicklaus also took until he was 46 to win his final Masters in 1986 - after the 2008 US Open, Woods had a full 14 years to catch him.</p><img id="i-53dc07ef67b6a593" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/09/4CB4E73500000578-0-image-a-2_1527668246349.jpg" height="756" width="962" alt="This graph shows how Woods was on course to beat Nicklaus's major record of 18, but has not won one since he was 32" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-389be058b0466a6f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/09/02E5F40A0000044D-5785983-image-a-17_1527756986073.jpg" height="698" width="962" alt="Woods holds aloft the Claret Jug after winning The Open at St Andrews, a feat he managed twice, in 2005" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-8a53b1e1f33de8eb" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/10/003B955000000258-5785983-image-a-31_1527758184911.jpg" height="326" width="962" alt="Woods after winning each the four majors in succession, the first man to do so; (from left) receiving the green jacket from Vijay Singh at the 2001 Masters, holding the Wanamaker trophy after the PGA Championship at Valhalla in 2000, with the Claret Jug after The Open at St Andrews in 2000, and after winning the 100th US Open at Pebble Beach, also in 2000" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-28a358d227ffe47c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/09/01A2A23600000578-5785983-image-a-15_1527756908034.jpg" height="610" width="962" alt="His 2008 US Open win was perhaps his greatest victory, having played in constant pain through serious knee and leg injuries" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Beyond the wins there are more extraordinary feats and statistics. His scoring average during the year 2000 was the lowest in history: 68.17. In effect, that means every time he teed it up Woods averaged what would be a score of 4 under par on a par-72 course. Take a look at the 10 lowest season-scoring averages in tour history and the four lowest are by Woods, as are six of the top eight. He once went through a streak of 66 competitive rounds where he shot even par or better.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Between February 1998 and May 2005 he did not miss a single cut, setting a record streak of 142 tournaments. The next best records belong to Byron Nelson and Nicklaus, who made 113 and 105 straight cuts respectively. And to put that into further context, the best active streak of cuts made on the PGA Tour is by Adam Hadwin, who has made 19 straight – just the 123 behind Woods's record.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it was not the numbers alone that enshrined Woods as a golfing divinity. When not playing well, he found ways to dig deep and win, even against the best the world had to offer. But when he was on form he simply crushed them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That first Masters win saw him set the lowest score relative to par of all time at Augusta, at 18 under (Jordan Spieth matched this score in 2015.) That utter demolition at Pebble Beach saw him become the first player to finish double-digits under par in a US Open – and no other player in that field even broke par (this also happened at the 2002 US Open at Bethpage Black). Fifteen strokes remains the greatest single winning margin in any major, but he also won The Open by a record eight strokes, at St Andrews in 2000. When he won the 2006 US PGA Championship at Medinah, Woods became the only golfer to have won all four majors by at least five strokes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any efforts to put Woods off his stride were met with something near contempt. Woods set out to eviscerate anyone who tried to knock him off his perch. Colin Montgomerie was the first to try at the Masters in 1997, suggesting his rival would be too young to cope with the pressure of leading. By the end, it was Monty who was the gibbering wreck. And pity poor Stephen Ames, an opponent at the 2006 Match Play Championship, who boldly suggested that 'anything can happen, especially where he's hitting the ball.' Tiger won the match 9&amp;8.</p><img id="i-2efb0d0c1e2ba38c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/10/001D45BE00000258-5785983-image-a-41_1527758528202.jpg" height="725" width="470" alt="Woods was the most famous sportsman on the planet for many years - and a streaker shows her admiration at Carnoustie in 1999" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-bb4c12be1d60ca9f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/10/00337BC100000258-5785983-image-m-40_1527758520674.jpg" height="725" width="470" alt="At his peak, Woods was the best ballstriker in the world, and had a dynamite short game to match" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps the most demonstrable measure of his dominance, however, was in the coining of a new phrase: 'Tiger proofing'. This was the concerted effort of course designers to toughen up their courses to unprecedented degrees for fear of Woods making them look his mere playgrounds. Even Augusta National succumbed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet still this is not the full story. Woods's ability to produce the utterly spectacular and sometimes seemingly impossible had a cosmic air.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Take, for example, his tee shot at the 16th hole at the Phoenix Open in 1997. Playing as a rookie professional at the rowdiest, most intimidating hole in golf, surrounded by thousands of baying, drunken college students, Woods's 9-iron from 162 yards was pure, right at the flagstick, bounced twice and dropped in for an ace. Cue pandemonium, with pints of beer hurled in the air like boozy confetti and a screaming Woods raising the roof, conducting the celebrations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was also his shot in the dark at the final hole in Firestone in 2000. Weather delays meant he had to finish his round in the near pitch black, but at 8.30pm Woods somehow hit his 8-iron to two feet to seal victory. His ball appeared 'out of a dark sky as suddenly as if Scotty had just beamed it down from the Starship Enterprise,' wrote Sports Illustrated's Gary van Sickle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And then there is the most famous shot of all time. Battling with Chris DiMarco down the stretch at the 2005 Masters, Woods overshot the 16th green and faced a daunting chip. He was forced to play at a strange angle away from the hole, rolling his ball to the very top of a slope in the green, judging it perfectly so that it trundled back down again towards the pin. The ball gathered momentum and tracked straight towards its target, before stopping agonisingly on the edge of the cup, the crowd both sighing with disappointment and blowing at the ball in the hope of one final roll. Roll it did, exposing the Nike tick in perfect clarity as it dropped into the hole for a quite incredible birdie and, as Woods went on to win in a play-off, marketing that money simply couldn't buy. But then you've already seen that – Nike made sure you did, over and over.</p><img id="i-ae516b5305e1fc1f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/10/002B3BA500000258-5785983-image-a-22_1527757934365.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="His 15-stroke victory at the 2000 US Open at Pebble Beach was the most destructive and dominant win in history" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-9318859090d1e0ce" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/09/32E862F000000578-5785983-image-a-8_1527756446605.jpg" height="541" width="962" alt="The agonising moment his ball rolled into the cup for a chip-in at the 2005 Masters - the most famous shot in history" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-676eebef7dbba241" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/10/00005C2500000258-5785983-image-a-28_1527758105757.jpg" height="738" width="962" alt="His hole-in-one at the 16th hole at the 1997 Phoenix Open in front of a huge crowd remains one of his most iconic moments" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nike weren't even interested in golf until they discovered Woods. But after discovering this unique opportunity the company then spent hundreds of millions of dollars on launching a golf clothing and equipment division to capitalise on his extraordinary talent. Many more corporate millions followed into his bank account, from Rolex to Gilette, EA Sports, AT&amp;T and Accenture. Even after losing many of his sponsors in the wake of his sex scandal, Forbes estimate that Woods has earned around $1.7billion during his career. Just to emphasise what a big deal he was, just ponder this: only a tenth of that figure was earned on the course. Yet that still amounts to $111,489,339, according to the PGA Tour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Tiger will do more than any other man in history to change the course of humanity,' once claimed his father and mentor, Earl. And while that seems, and did seem at the time, ridiculous, Woods represented something far more significant than golf, or any sport for that matter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A black, working-class man dominating a game previously seen as a rich, white man's preserve made him the biggest story in all of sport. He was smashing down racial and cultural barriers every week, as the first African-American to win the Masters and by winning relentlessly at ultra-conservative country clubs where he would not even have been allowed to play just a few years previously, simply because of the colour of his skin. </p><img id="i-a52df1aada7319bb" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/10/0068D76E00000258-5785983-image-a-18_1527757650584.jpg" height="768" width="962" alt="Thousands of fans crowd onto a sand dune to watch Woods on the 6th green at Royal St George's at the 2003 Open" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another one of Earl Woods's predictions has become famous, more so over the course of the decade since his son's last major victory. 'I'm going to make a prediction,' he said on the night Tiger won his third US Amateur Championship. 'Before he's through, my son will win 14 major championships.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With each major that slips away, each missed putt and each pained grimace, Earl's prediction gains the sort of accuracy that Tiger would now kill to have with that erratic driver of his.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But even as his powers diminish, the memory of Woods's accomplishments compels us to want more, to believe against all odds that he can if not beat Nicklaus's record then at least capture one last major. It seems fanciful. Just a few months ago it was uncertain whether Woods would even walk again, let alone play golf, so bad was the chronic deterioration in his back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And yet he is walking. He is playing golf. He is actually playing very good golf. And if he ever gets a sniff of another major, you'd better believe he can win. He still believes. After all, only one man can truly ever walk down a fairway telling himself: 'I am Tiger Woods.'</p><img id="i-9de4fb073611604d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/10/04A38E92000007D0-5785983-image-a-37_1527758432730.jpg" height="687" width="962" alt="Woods is showing signs of recovering at long last from his injuries, and could yet add to his colossal haul of victories" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox sport" data-version="2" id="mol-ad27f4b0-6423-11e8-ac4a-2f6fa6e51923">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">HOW TIGER WOODS WON ALL OF HIS 14 MAJORS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>THE MASTERS </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1997</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The win that shocked the world. Woods claimed his first major by an enormous 12 strokes, from Tom Kite. And that after scoring 40 for his opening 9 holes before sparking into life. His 18-under-par score remains a record. He was the youngest Masters winner (21) and the first non-white winner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2001</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was a surprise it took four years for Augusta win No 2 to come along, but this one completed the 'Tiger Slam' – when Woods held all four major titles at once, having won the other three consecutively the previous year. Woods held off big rivals David Duval and Phil Mickelson to win.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2002</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Augusta suits had started to 'Tiger-proof' the course by adding length but could not stop him retaining the green jacket, a feat only managed by Jack Nicklaus (in 1966) and Nick Faldo (in 1990) before. Heavyweights in Retief Goosen, Mickelson and Jose Maria Olazabal were left trailing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2005</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 16th green in the final round saw arguably the most famous shot ever played: Woods's chip sent away from the hole, rolling up the slope and then back down again at a right angle before hanging on the edge of the cup then finally dropping for birdie. A play-off win over Chris DiMarco followed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>US OPEN</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2000</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tiger at the very peak of his powers; a 15-shot victory at Pebble Beach that was and is the most dominant performance ever witnessed. He was the only player to finish under par (-12) and became the first player in the history of the US Open to finish at double-digits under par for the tournament.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2002</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the first time in 30 years a player won both the masters and US Open consecutively, setting up a tilt at the calendar Grand Slam (later ruined by horrific weather at Muirfield.) Here, Woods tamed the feared Bethpage Black course in New York, beating poor Mickelson once again by three.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2008</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The final and most remarkable major win of Woods's career to date. Doubling over in pain after every shot due to playing with a double stress fracture in his left leg, Woods scrambled into a play-off with a birdie on the 72nd hole. He repeated the trick the next day to break Rocco Mediate's heart.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>THE OPEN </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2000</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the Home of Golf, Woods became just the fifth player ever to wrap up the career Grand Slam, and the youngest ever aged 24. He blew away Ernie Els and Thomas Bjorn to win by eight on the Old Course at St Andrews, setting a new low score for any major championship of 19 under par.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2005</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Woods again proved himself the master of St Andrews, the historic venue considered the most prized place at which to win an Open. He led wire-to-wire, opening with a six-under-par 66 before holding off the final-round challenge from home favourite Colin Montgomerie to win the Claret Jug.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2006</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the death of his father and mentor, Earl, just two months earlier, Woods produced a stunning, controlled performance at Hoylake, eschewing his driver in favour of hitting his 'stinger' long iron off the tee. After his two-shot win over Chris Di Marco was sealed, Woods dissolved into floods of tears.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>US PGA CHAMPIONSHIP </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1999</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Woods's second major was sealed after a tumultuous battle with Sergio Garcia, whose fiery antics at Medinah started a long and often unfriendly rivalry. Woods held off the teenage Spaniard by just one shot, and many predicted they would duel in many majors to come, which never came to pass.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2000</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Wanamaker Trophy was retained after a play-off win at Valhalla over the unlikely candidate of Bob May, who never won on the PGA Tour, with Thomas Bjorn five shots adrift. It was the first time since Ben Hogan in 1953 that anyone had won three majors in a single year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2006</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Woods finished five shots clear of Shaun Micheel, the shock 2003 champion, with old rival Garcia one further back once again at Medinah, and Luke Donald was the major challenger before falling away at the last. Here, Woods became the first ever to win the US PGA twice on the same course.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2007</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The players roasted in 100-degree heat during a heatwave in Oklahoma and at one stage in the final round Woods's lead was whittled down to just one shot, but his mental fortitude again proved decisive. He retained the title at Southern Hills by two shots from Woody Austin.</p>                            </div>                        </div><div>

He had arrived even before most of the world had ever seen Him hit a ball, with Nike lighting the fuse by filming an ethnically diverse succession of children proclaiming 'I am Tiger Woods'. An explosive 12-shot win at the Masters aged just 21 then followed and it was clear: this would be the greatest golfer the world had ever seen. But then it became a question of if, not when. That heroic victory at Torrey Pines, 10 years ago now, took its toll, leading to serious knee surgery. Back problems started to follow and, with each debilitating injury and subsequent operation it became apparent that He was human after all.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Brian Lee</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T09:13:14.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Tiger Woods has not won a major for 10 years... do we care any more?</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T09:13:14.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Tiger Woods,US Open Golf</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-5827903/Dustin-Johnson-regains-world-No-1-ranking-six-shot-victory-FedEx-St-Jude-Classic.html" title="Dustin Johnson regains world No 1 ranking after six-shot victory at FedEx St. Jude Classic"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-5825467/Tiger-Woods-good-company-Open-week.html" title="Tiger Woods in good company for the US Open as he will play alongside Justin Thomas and Dustin Johnson at Shinnecock Hills this week"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-5825433/Justin-Rose-admits-no-better-way-world-No-1-winning-Open.html" title="Justin Rose admits there would be no better way of becoming world No 1 than by winning the US Open"></link></item><item><title>Transfer news LIVE: All the latest from Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea plus the best from Europe</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5828895/Transfer-news-LIVE-latest-Man-United-Arsenal-Liverpool-Chelsea.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2018 08:04:17 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5828895</guid><description><![CDATA[As the start of the World Cup edges closer, teams across Europe face a race against time to wrap up deals before kick-off in Russia.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Given all his psychological traumas, the near-15,000 crowd in the Manchester Arena were prepared to smile upon the Pagliacci clowning which betrayed the nerves he admitted suffering 'before what felt like another debut.' Promoter Frank Warren knows there would be reduced public tolerance of a repeat performance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fury was still carrying excess blubber despite shedding eight stones and Warren said: 'Tyson needs to lose even more weight before he fights on Carl Frampton's card at Windsor Park on August 18.

Taking off all those stones in less than three months is physically draining and he also had to start shaking off the ring rust after such a long lay-off.' The clamour for Fury to set about regaining the several belts he gave over to Anthony Joshua will be resisted until next summer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Tyson needs more time and more fights,' says Warren. In any event Joshua, WBC champion Deontay Wilder and even WBA 'regular' tile holder Manuel Charr - who failed to materialise at ringside as promised - are otherwise occupied until then. Not least with each other in the case of AJ and Bronze Bomber Wilder.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nor is Fury likely to take up Tony Bellew's challenge next. Fury says: 'After this one against Seferi I need a big heavyweight, not another small opponent.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'One step at a time,' counsels Warren. Although the next one must be over a higher hurdle than Seferi, who at ten inches shorter and more than four and a half stone lighter was dwarfed by the 6ft 9in and 19st 10lbs Manchester traveller.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So pleased was Fury to see Seferi that he planted a smacker on his cheek before the off, then another when it all came to a premature end.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For most of the time between those gestures Fury pranced and postured, grinned and grimaced. He also held his arms wide by way of inviting Seferi to hit him if he could.

He is, it seems, a young man who will never forget his roots.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He now lives on Merseyside with his childhood sweetheart Megan Davison but made a point of returning to the North-East to collect his Football Writers' Young Player of the Year award in February. The comedian that night was, at times, as blue as Everton's jersey, but Pickford laughed along heartily, later taking time to chat to Sunderland fans. Earlier, it had been his turn to oblige with a queue of autograph hunters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He's a typical, down-to-earth local lad, there is no arrogance to him, it's all confidence,' says Adrian Tucker, the former Sunderland goalkeeping coach who worked with Pickford after his first-team breakthrough.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remarkably, that did not arrive until January 2016, coming on the back of loan spells and more than 100 appearances at Darlington, Alfreton, Burton, Carlisle, Bradford and Preston.</p><img id="i-6b42a1c1774a6263" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/22/4D0D903F00000578-5827471-Pickford_had_loan_spells_at_Darlington_Alfreton_Burton_Carlisle_-m-3_1528665660421.jpg" height="496" width="634" alt="Pickford had loan spells at Darlington, Alfreton, Burton, Carlisle, Bradford and Preston" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'What I love about him is his mental strength,' says Tucker. 'We used to play golf together and I would give him a thrashing, but he got over it - he'd always come back for more.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I remember going to watch him when he was on loan at Bradford against Yeovil. In the first five minutes he got absolutely clattered by their big centre-forward. The first thing he did was get straight back up. I thought, "You'll do for me, son".'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was not always Pickford being clattered, however. Sunderland's juniors were away at Crystal Palace one afternoon when his usually dependable kicking let him down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What followed has stayed with Honeyman, and he laughs as he begins: 'He mishit this clearance and it's obviously annoyed him. It wasn't going to make halfway. Jordan has realised and gone steaming out, chasing after it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The ball landed with their player on about the centre circle and he was just getting himself composed, unaware that Jordan was running towards him at full speed.</p><img id="i-4c970476218bdcd4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/22/4D1E869400000578-5827471-image-a-11_1528664841654.jpg" height="439" width="634" alt="He clashed with Ball as instead of playing out from the back he used to kick it to the wingers" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Honestly, it was one of the best tackles I've ever seen! He's sent their guy absolutely flying but won the ball with it. He wiped him out, I don't think the lad recovered. But that's Jordan - determination, pride in himself and confidence.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Keeping Pickford within the confines of his penalty area was a constant issue for Ball, and not because he was prone to a rush of blood. Far from it, it was more because of his composure than a lack of it, those skills honed playing in the street with older brother Richard Logan, a one-time striker for Darlington.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We had one session where we put the goalkeeper at centre-back, just to help them understand the game from the position directly in front of them,' says Ball.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Jordan was unbelievable. He was just as good as an outfield player because of that natural footballing talent with his feet. The way he can strike a ball with pace and accuracy… But that also became a problem. We wanted to play the ball out from the back and the keepers had to use the defenders.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I remember Jordan pinging the ball 50 yards to the right-winger with his first touch. I said, "What you doing, we want to play out from the back?". He said, "Yeah, but I'm better than them". I looked at him and thought, "Yeah, you're probably right".'</p><img id="i-4a0fb11d205d85d2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/22/1788DEEA000005DC-5827471-image-m-13_1528664986431.jpg" height="571" width="634" alt="Ball once said: 'You'll never make it with that attitude.' Pickford fired back 'Yeah I will'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Honeyman, too, recalls his friend's playing ambitions. 'He was always desperate to go outfield during training,' he says. 'It got to the point where it annoyed everyone - we were like, "Jordan, just get in goal".</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But even at Under-16s we were getting bigger crowds because people were coming just to watch him, and that never happens for a goalkeeper. They used to come just to see his kicking. That showed how special he was, even back then.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pickford was pulling onto his mother's driveway in October 2016 when he got the call to say he had been selected for England. Sue did not believe her son when he entered the terraced family home and delivered the shock news. They certainly believe him now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He totally deserves this,' says Honeyman. 'It seemed to take him longer than we thought to be Sunderland's No 1. He should have been a few years earlier.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But he's still done exceptionally well to achieve this so quickly. I look back at us, as kids, and we just knew he would go to the very top.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ball finishes with some advice. 'Jordan has the ability to be one of the world's best goalkeepers,' he says. 'What he has achieved so far is fabulous, now he has to challenge himself again, and I'm sure he will, he won't stop, that's what I love about him.'</p><img id="i-b5461490a863dbdb" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/22/4D1E983A00000578-5827471-image-a-22_1528665209203.jpg" height="388" width="634" alt="His first call up was in 2016 and Honeyman says looking back they knew he would go to the top" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>

The snap was sent to John O'Shea, a team-mate of the young goalkeeper at Sunderland. George Honeyman was in the Black Cats dressing room when O'Shea shared it with the rest of the squad. 'Rooney wrote, "Hasn't said a word!",' reveals the midfielder, a pal of Pickford since the age of 11 at the club's academy. 'It was funny, Jordan was so lively at Sunderland, he never shut up.

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is way too high and has consistently been too high for the last two or three years. Thinking back, England were also conceding that number of penalties when Stuart Lancaster was in charge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are occasions when conceding a penalty is the right option, three points instead of seven. And there are also occasions when the opposition player gets the better of you — particularly in the scrum and line-out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the majority of penalties are down to sloppy play, slow thought process, panicking under pressure, poor technique, dull play, poor understanding of the laws — especially around the tackle area — and also what constitutes offside.</p><img id="i-5e787c6fcc45f09e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/20/4D1613A100000578-5827499-image-a-77_1528660119161.jpg" height="407" width="634" alt="The penalty count is way too high and has consistently been too high for the last few years" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The majority of penalties are eminently avoidable and when it happens match after match you can be sure it’s down to you, not the referee.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What is really beginning to irritate me — and should annoy any England supporter — is the way some England players shrug off these penalty decisions as if they are just part of the game and of little importance. Wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I don’t like that acceptance of yet another penalty or that insolent look you get which says: ‘I might have been penalised but I was right and you were wrong.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Players have got to start getting angry with colleagues who give away needless penalties. I would appoint a player to keep an eye on this and dish out harsh words.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With England I used to ask Matt Dawson to keep an eye on the penalty decisions, keep on top of what was happening and dish out a few strong words if somebody gave away a really soft one. Dawson was brilliant at this because we made it his responsibility, but it is also common sense.</p><img id="i-b89b5f9d3cb068f3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/21/4D15737200000578-5827499-But_the_majority_of_penalties_are_down_to_sloppy_play_and_Handre-a-46_1528661824831.jpg" height="427" width="306" alt="But the majority of penalties are down to sloppy play and Handre Pollard punished England" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-7b23d0d6a6af249e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/21/4D1630E100000578-5827499-image-m-45_1528661819544.jpg" height="427" width="306" alt="Pollard was also effective when it came to stopping England's players" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It also needs somebody to clock what the trends are and where England need to tighten up. The captain has a fair bit on his plate and is often trying to keep a smooth relationship going with the referee. It needs a trusted lieutenant to dish out some chosen words to transgressors. England players must also start calling colleagues out in other ways. Ben Youngs had a decent game but there was one ridiculous moment when the pack won invaluable turnover ball in defence. Instead of kicking it into the green seats, he kicked long and the Boks ran it and eventually scored.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That’s not good enough and England have got to take each other to task on stuff like that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Collectively, they must look at that game and ask: how did we, a professional rugby team, manage to lose a match which we led 24-3 after 20 minutes?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those are the negatives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The frustrating thing is there is so much talent in this team and at times on Saturday they had me on the edge of my seat.</p><img id="i-d98a866a6fa4c6d9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/20/4D15DA9500000578-5827499-image-a-79_1528660181214.jpg" height="416" width="634" alt="There is so much talent in this team and at times they had me on the edge of my seat" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">England have got to start boxing clever now. The bubble has burst. Teams are looking at England and thinking the way to beat this team is not to play a slow game, but play an all-out fast game. So England have to keep them guessing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A number of our unforced errors came from players playing out of position and feeling a little out of their comfort zone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Elliot Daly (below) is a supremely gifted player but for all his excellent contributions on Saturday, there were moments when he looked out of sorts at 15. For example, missing the ball in-goal when the Boks scored a try, kicking the ball long from 80 yards and ignoring Mike Brown on the overlap, then kicking instead of passing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brown confirmed he is a hardcore international player, but at full back, not wing. I would simply switch those two over again for Saturday’s second Test.</p><img id="i-f36350e9a6aabd04" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/20/4D15F60900000578-5827499-image-a-80_1528660204907.jpg" height="447" width="634" alt="England have got to start boxing clever now because teams have found their weaknesses" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brad Shields is a back-rower and unsurprisingly looked uncomfortable playing lock. I believe taking off Nick Isiekwe so early was wrong; England needed to try and slow things down a little and get some control up front when the Boks started surging back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We need to find out about Shields so he needs to start the next Test in his best position, which is six.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tom Curry was spirited and I am convinced he has a big England future but this series is probably a season too early for a 19-year-old.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">George Ford was excellent in that first 20 minutes but England need to find out about Danny Cipriani. Eddie must use this tour to find the missing parts of the jigsaw. We saw how effective in-form Premiership players like Faf de Klerk and Willie le Roux were for the Springboks — perhaps Cipriani could do the same for England. Let’s at least find out.</p><div>

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘In this game he played in a midfield twosome with Darren Potter and Alan Smith — the former Leeds and Manchester United striker — played just ahead of them to form a triangle. Sadly, the Dons lost 3-2.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over the subsequent months I watched Alli develop. My reports would usually be submitted to Tottenham on a piece of A4 paper, dated, handwritten and signed at the bottom. There would occasionally be verbal feedback too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I watched him play in a 1-0 win over Crewe in August 2013 when he operated behind front man Patrick Bamford, who was on loan from Chelsea. I suggested: ‘He needs to come from deeper and does not know the game yet. But he has a wonderful chance of a good career in the game. He is 6ft 2in and an easy mover. He is not electric but he can cover ground easily. He has good passing skills and is not selfish. He is a forceful player with a touch of arrogance.’</p><img id="i-9fe43f5ded6d42b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/01/30AB183600000578-5827601-Alli_left_featured_as_MK_Dons_beat_Manchester_United_4_0_in_the_-a-15_1528677142188.jpg" height="410" width="634" alt="Alli (left) featured as MK Dons beat Manchester United 4-0 in the League Cup in 2014 " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I added: ‘The chairman at MK Dons feels that he will develop better with more games before they even think about a sale. We must monitor when and if he is available at the right price. We must be ready’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At Tottenham there was some understandable scepticism as people wanted to be assured of Alli’s quality. He was a third-tier player but over time what I reported held sway. No player of his age will perform well every time you watch him and, for example, there was one game at Stevenage on a poor pitch when I left feeling underwhelmed. He was inconsistent that day and was also not always used in what may have been his best position.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On February 1, 2014, I watched him come on as a substitute against Tranmere and wrote: ‘He looked strong, unfazed but showed little guile.

There would regularly be other representatives from clubs present at MK Dons games.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On September 27, 2014, Alli played in a 3-2 defeat at Bristol City and I wrote: ‘He had a quiet game but still showed positive characteristics, Unselfish as a team player. Two years ago I would have gambled between £1million and £1.5m but now I feel he will eventually cost more than £3.5m.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By January 2015, Alli had improved further and after a 2-0 home win over Barnsley I wrote: ‘Playing in midfield, he showed athleticism and timing to get into the opponents’ box and was not lazy on recovery. He passes simply but can also play a clever one. He is not outstanding in the air but will compete. I like the way he runs off the ball to open up space for colleagues and I don’t doubt his bravery.</p><img id="i-c839f19e2e77aefd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/21/2547A1E600000578-5827601-Alli_s_strength_and_excellent_technique_were_evident_during_his_-m-54_1528664244506.jpg" height="488" width="634" alt="Alli's strength and excellent technique were evident during his displays for MK Dons" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no doubt in my mind he can crack it but he will need to be assured of a pathway. I think it is a no-brainer. He compares favourably with Paulinho already and has shades of Frank Lampard in him.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the end the MK Dons chairman Peter Winkelman came to the day when he had to satisfy the boy’s ambitions and of course the club’s need to sell. He sold him to Tottenham for £5m later that month. Other clubs were vying for his signature, most prominently Aston Villa and Newcastle.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS sport" data-version="2" id="mol-83937920-6ce9-11e8-a730-edcbbf99dfea">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">DELE ALLI'S MK DONS CAREER </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2012/13:</strong> 7 games, 1 goal</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2013/14: </strong>37 games, 7 goals</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2014/15: </strong>44 games, 16 goals </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">That did not surprise me but that was never an option and I thought Winkelman was excellent throughout.

</div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>DAVID PLEAT: Dele Alli has moved from rich potential into maturity under the clever coaching of Mauricio Pochettino and his assistant Jesus Perez at Tottenham. Now he faces the ultimate test as, in all probability, England’s youngest outfield player in Russia. Recently I have found it fascinating to revisit my reports of this young man and see how regular games playing in league football at such a young age for MK Dons improved his game and supported my view that we should bring him to Spurs. On his Football League debut against Coventry in League One on December 29, 2012, I wrote: ‘He looked nervous but at only 17 he has a lovely build and has a potential that we must follow.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Jeorge Bird</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T01:36:05.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>How I convinced Tottenham to sign Dele Alli from MK Dons</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T01:36:05.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Dele Alli,Tottenham Hotspur,England Football,World Cup 2018</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5826639/Dele-Alli-shine-World-Cup-swagger-Brazilian-says-Roberto-Carlos.html" title="'He has that swagger that Brazilians have': Dele Alli will shine for England at World Cup because he plays like a Brazilian, says Roberto Carlos"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5826745/Harry-Kane-cope-England-pressure-says-Gary-Lineker.html" title="'You know he won't be scared': Harry Kane will carry burden of being England's captain and main striker at the World Cup, says Gary Lineker"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5826627/French-president-Macron-reveals-really-liked-Waddle-spell-Marseille.html" title="'They were a team that made me dream': French president Emmanuel Macron reveals he 'really liked Chris Waddle' during former England winger's spell at Marseille"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5826947/England-squad-intense-session-Gareth-Southgate-World-Cup-horizon.html" title="Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling and their England team-mates are put through intense session by Gareth Southgate with World Cup on horizon"></link></item><item><title>Eddie Jones is on the ropes...

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the last two games, England have shipped 14 tries. Fourteen. Those were losses four and five in this troubling sequence, against the Barbarians and the Springboks. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jones sought to challenge some of the damning details, but while the setback at Twickenham late last month did not occur in a bona fide Test, being run ragged by a scratch invitational side in their own stadium won't have done much for morale in the squad, whether caps were awarded or not.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The head coach bristled when asked if he believed his team are progressing, despite the five defeats in a row. 'We've not had five defeats,' said Jones. 'We have lost four Test matches.' Pushed on the fact that the Barbarians fixture was still contested by a senior England team, he added: 'I'm not going to answer that question because I will lose my patience.' </p><img id="i-a63a5223aa759c86" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/20/4D15A22C00000578-5827443-image-a-36_1528657788541.jpg" height="400" width="634" alt="The number of tries conceded and tackles missed recently are up to uncomfortable levels" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Earlier on Sky Sports, he was challenged about the glaring defensive lapses which have caused such damage lately and he said: 'Fourteen tries in two games? What is the other game you are talking about? That (Barbarians game) wasn't a Test match.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, he did admit: 'We certainly conceded some easy tries.' Semantics can't provide respite for these tourists, only a victory over South Africa will do that - preferably next weekend in Bloemfontein, to keep this series alive. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A stockpile of poor results is cranking up the pressure and tension around the set-up, with the added aggravation of a dispute with the clubs over training-ground injuries, financial upheaval within the RFU leading to job losses, a long casualty list and the need to recruit new attack and defence coaches. </p><img id="i-d695ac774061aecb" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/23/4D17B43A00000578-5827443-They_are_a_side_who_have_mislaid_the_handy_knack_of_finding_a_wa-m-6_1528670623136.jpg" height="396" width="634" alt="They are a side who have mislaid the handy knack of finding a way to win in tight situations" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-1c8fc2a5c69246fa" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/20/4D1DD6F800000578-5827443-image-a-44_1528658128527.jpg" height="364" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the eye of this raging storm are a team who started the first Test in stunning fashion, with three early tries - scored by Mike Brown, Elliot Daly and Owen Farrell - as George Ford wielded the conductor's baton to devastating effect. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To Jones, this first-quarter attacking masterclass was ample proof that morale has not been chronically undermined by the recent rough patch. 'The way we played the first 20 minutes, we didn't look like a side who had lost their last three games,' he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what followed was a calamitous loss of control and momentum. England essentially did nothing productive for the best part of 50 minutes, with just one Farrell penalty coming during this long spell of utter Springbok domination. </p><img id="i-4942b4945e628350" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/20/4D1575FF00000578-5827443-image-a-39_1528657867366.jpg" height="396" width="634" alt="In the eye of this raging storm are a team who started the first Test in stunning fashion" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-649b17e1af8458c7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/20/4D15742A00000578-5827443-image-a-40_1528657881167.jpg" height="401" width="634" alt="The attacking masterclass was ample proof that morale has not been chronically undermined" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-5c97da40cf0fa19e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/20/4D1DCD5700000578-5827443-image-a-43_1528658118738.jpg" height="312" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The forwards were overwhelmed, the defence unravelled and the whole team appeared to lose energy, composure and intensity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The visitors were rash in thoughts and actions - conceding a torrent of penalties which handed the initiative to South Africa. When Mako Vunipola was sin-binned just after the hour, for a late charge into the brilliant Bok scrum-half, Faf de Klerk, it capped a spell of erratic and inadequate English resistance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once Maro Itoje's clumsy lunge over a ruck gifted De Klerk the space for a comeback try in the 20th minute, South Africa thundered back into the game. And once the force was with them, they did not relinquish their grip, despite a glorious solo try by Jonny May giving England late hope.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Boks adapted defensively to their rivals' initial onslaught in the wide channels, but there was no English response, in terms of a tactical shift, to stay one step ahead. They possessed an arsenal of aerial firepower, but did not unleash their kicking game on the home side. Having stormed into a 24-3 lead, there was a case for adopting a more territorial approach, but Jones said: 'You can't close a game down with 60 minutes to go.' </p><img id="i-51ff528e3a41a0c4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/20/4D15F62600000578-5827443-image-a-42_1528657998381.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Once De Klerk scored a comeback try in the 20th minute, South Africa thundered back into life" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-e7a32a105d3af67c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/20/4D15F6B400000578-5827443-image-a-48_1528658423874.jpg" height="407" width="634" alt="S'busiso Nkosi scored twice as he exploited England's deficiency's outside all evening" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-267f9843cc891540" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/20/4D15DA9500000578-5827443-image-a-49_1528658583845.jpg" height="416" width="634" alt="Owen Farrell is adamant that there is sufficient belief in the squad to launch a rearguard action" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-2604e7ff491cfbea" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/23/4D1F0B0900000578-5827443-image-a-8_1528670762391.jpg" height="375" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">England's daring approach during their purple patch did not revolve around Billy Vunipola's driving power, as their best moments so often have done in the past. The giant No 8 went the distance on Saturday but he was a low-key figure; eclipsed by his opposite number, Duane Vermeulen. Nathan Hughes made an impact when he came off the bench and that might prompt a selection dilemma.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There will be plenty of those, especially up front. Harry Williams will come into contention to start at tighthead, after Kyle Sinckler was put under set-piece pressure, while Tom Curry was the only back-rower to emerge with reputation enhanced, as the top tackler in the match.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At lock, Jones really needs Joe Launchbury to recover from his calf injury, after removing Nick Isiekwe before half-time, in order to introduce Brad Shields for his debut. The Kiwi recruit must now be a strong contender to start in Bloemfontein, somewhere in the pack.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Farrell is adamant that there is still sufficient belief in the Red Rose squad to launch a series rear-guard action five days from now. Jones was similarly bullish, saying: 'There is no reason why we can't turn it around.' But this is truly a rut that England now find themselves in. Therapy is required. They dazzled in defeat at Ellis Park, but next time they would surely settle for being dull in a precious victory. </p><div>

</div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>JONATHAN McEVOY IN MONTREAL: Lewis Hamilton’s radio persona had taken on a despairing air long before the Canadian Grand Prix was over and the inquest began into the possible death of the Mercedes super-team.  The brutal fact is that Hamilton started his afternoon at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve leading the world championship by 14 points. By the end, after an engine problem condemned him to finish fifth, he was trailing the winner Sebastian Vettel by one.  Here, of all places, on the track where Hamilton registered the first win of his career, and five more, the mask of Mercedes’ invulnerability slipped a little more than it already has this season. Maintaining the lofty standards they have set over four years of total dominance is a mighty hard task – and that is how it is beginning to look seven races into a finely balanced title fight. </dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Danny Gallagher</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T00:06:08.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Sebastian Vettel cruises to victory in Montreal to win the Canadian GP</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T00:06:08.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Lewis Hamilton</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-5827165/Canadian-Grand-Prix-2018-LIVE-Latest-F1-updates-Montreal.html" title="Canadian Grand Prix, RESULT: Sebastian Vettel wins to snatch championship lead off Lewis Hamilton "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-5825291/Cool-Max-Sir-Jackie-Stewart-tells-hot-head-Verstappen-copy-F1s-true-greats-slow-down.html" title="Cool it Max!

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Counter and intuitive</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While they took 10 minutes to settle, Tunisia unleashed a blurring counter-attacking approach that had Spain on the back foot time and again. It's no stretch to say they created the four best openings of the first-half on the break as Spain's stand-in right back Alvaro Odriozola was given a torrid time and the vaunted pairing of Gerard Pique and Sergio Ramos were panicked too by smart, incisive moves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The North Africans' 4-5-1 quickly becomes a 4-3-3 when they win possession and spring fluidly forward.

It's paying off.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While Tunisia were compact in defence and harried the Spanish midfield from the off, they were also comfortable committing big numbers forward — and not just on the break. The first half ended with nine Tunisian players in the Spain half during a concerted period of passing and pressure rather than because of a set-piece. The manager's more progressive, positive outlook is being reflected on the pitch.</p><img id="i-e22565ba2b1ebe12" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/17/4CF19D7E00000578-5826925-image-a-48_1528647424097.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="There is a general consensus that Nabil Maaloul is taking a refreshingly looser approach now" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Inexperienced but unfazed</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tunisia arrived in Russia with one of the more inexperienced squads — 13 of the panel have played less than 15 internationals.

The lack of experience is partly a result of Maaloul's diligent recruitment drive of European-born or based players in recent times.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gent right back Dylan Bronn won just his fifth cap against Spain but stared down Andres Iniesta impressively, allowing little change. In front of him Montpellier's Ellyes Skhiri, also on five caps, was always busy, roving across midfield and sparking many of those quick breaks. Rookies? They didn't look it.</p><img id="i-cab42cd45937007f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/17/4D1A968B00000578-5826925-image-a-49_1528647536122.jpg" height="491" width="634" alt="Dylan Bronn won just his fifth cap against Spain but handled Andres Iniesta impressively" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>If at first you don't succeed…</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tunisia's stoic resistance was finally broken on 85 minutes by Iago Aspas, by which stage Spain manager Julen Lopetegui had changed his formation for a third time.
