<p class="mol-para-with-font">That looks like icing,' said my 12-year-old son Freddie, peering at the entrance to Park Guell in Barcelona.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was referring to the intricate swirly architecture that runs the length of the park Antoni Gaudi designed for his benefactor Eusebi Guell.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The buildings and monuments that give the Catalonian capital its unique character are particularly appealing to children. For parents, this provides another great reason to head to Barcelona for a city break.</p><img id="i-f0db619e65eb22c2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/10/4D21821200000578-5829145-image-a-3_1528709544978.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Fun for kids: Sarah Chalmers' brood loved the swirly architecture of Gaudi's Park Guell " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">After years of campsites, theme parks and children's entertainment, we felt we'd 'earned' the right to something more adult.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Would it work for Freddie and his ten-yearold twin siblings Bobby and Loulou? To lessen the shock for our children, we stayed in a holiday park but substituted visits to the kids club and pool with trips into Barcelona and nearby Sitges.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our base for the week was a three-bedroom mobile home run by Al Fresco Holidays in Costa Dorada's Vilanova Park, near the town of Vilanova i la Geltru, and 50km from Barcelona.</p><img id="i-201d21656c463525" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/10/4CF1988300000578-5829145-image-a-1_1528709040841.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="All worn out: Freddie (centre) with twins Bobby and Loulou after a day in the Catalonian capital" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The park was similar to several others we've enjoyed in France - clusters of chalets and caravans, dotted along 'avenues' in a campsite complete with pool, bar and restaurant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was also suitably 'Spanish' in character, with a central plaza, lots of trees, and all laid out on a hillside. Al Fresco reps 'Hev n Kev' ran a mini reception stocked with bats, balls and games.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the real bonus of Vilanova Park was the excellent bus service that stopped just outside the site. Not only did airport buses stop there, but every half hour a bus to Barcelona (via Sitges) picked up passengers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The city centre was 50 minutes, door-to-door, so we made the trip twice. It was cheap, too -the campsite sold bus tickets in books of 10 for 35 euros, which meant the entire family could make the return journey for a little over £30. A book of ten tickets to Sitges, a 20-minute journey, was 16 euros.</p><img id="i-936d2308958c02f9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/10/4CF1989D00000578-5829145-image-a-2_1528709043446.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Making a splash: The waterslides at Vilanova Park, which also has two swimming pools" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The open-topped bus tour in Barcelona was expensive, by contrast - 30 euros for a day. But this was a painless way of sightseeing with fairly young children. And the buildings are so striking that you can view several from the road without paying the entrance fees.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We alighted at Gaudi's famous unfinished cathedral, La Sagrada Familia, and marvelled at the craftsmanship. The city has vowed to finish the monument in time for the 100-year anniversary of Gaudi's death, in 2026. We also spent an hour or so at Park Guell, which Gaudi designed as a housing estate and where he also lived.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other big hits included the Barcelona football stadium, Las Ramblas and department store El Corte Ingles. A friend had told us about the store's ninth-floor cafe with panoramic views of the city, and this proved the ideal dinner spot, with affordable tapas and churros along with the usual child-friendly dishes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We could have stayed in Barcelona until after 10pm and still caught a bus back, but we were exhausted and keen to see Sitges the following day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With its pretty beach and winding streets, the seaside town proved just as big a hit with our children. On our penultimate day, we squeezed in another town visit -to Vilanova i la Geltru, 10 minutes on the bus in the opposite direction. Its own mini Ramblas came to when the local schoolchildren emerged.</p><img id="i-38c1649e5395c0a7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/10/4D21822A00000578-5829145-image-a-4_1528709562752.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Daytrippers: The pretty coastal town of Sitges was also a big hit with Sarah's children" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Satiated with culture, we were happy to mooch around the campsite on the final day. The children braved the outdoor pool and slide, then joined us in the indoor spa, which is free Monday-Friday and has a lovely pool, hot tub and sauna.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the evening, we tried the delightful campsite restaurant -with a warm and welcoming atmosphere, a huge menu including paella, calamari and moules, along with pizza, and an adjoining bar with entertainment. All that remained was a gentle stroll down the hill back to our mobile home, with the satisfaction that, yes, we could manage a city break with family in tow.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-92da9bb0-6d58-11e8-82ff-3d0bec9ddb59">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TRAVEL FACTS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Al Fresco Holidays (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="https://www.alfresco-holidays.com/">alfrescoholidays.com</a>, 0161 332 8900) offers seven nights at Vilanova Park from £1,016 per family of six, in a two-bedroom mobile home, in high season (book by July 3).

The four A330-200s were introduced to Virgin Atlantic's fleet in March after the airline acquired them from the now defunct Air Berlin.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">This bright, lively destination was recently named one of the world’s friendliest cities. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It matches the Scottish capital Edinburgh for top-class museums, and adds to its appeal with giant street murals, acres of green space, good food, music and the exquisite legacy of designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gareth Huw Davies gives his top tips on how to spend a weekend in this sparkling city…</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>DAY 1</strong></strong></p><img id="i-d89a5c2ce6d885a4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/15/4D12F45900000578-0-image-a-85_1528554157429.jpg" height="852" width="634" alt="Modern marvel: The Riverside Transport Museum was designed by Zaha Hadid" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MORNING </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bustling, pedestrianised Buchanan Street is regarded by many as Britain’s finest shopping street. Many big names are here, occupying tall, proud Victorian buildings. Branching off it is Ingram Street, Glasgow’s answer to Bond Street.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you come by train, your tour starts around here. Central and Queen Street stations are both nearby.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A good place to mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868-1928), who created some of the city’s most distinctive buildings, is his first creation – the former headquarters of the Glasgow Herald newspaper on Mitchell Street. Restored as The Lighthouse, it houses Scotland’s Centre for Design and Architecture. It’s worth a visit for an exhibition on Mackintosh, and to see the helix-shaped staircase.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Walk up Buchanan Street, past the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall and turn left into the city’s other famous way, Sauchiehall Street. A big attraction here, and a good place to stop for refreshment, is the Willow Tea Rooms and Salon de Luxe (willowtearoomstrust.org). It reopens on July 2, refurbished to Mackintosh’s original design.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You could walk on west, but the route is across the busy M8. A more peaceful alternative is to take the subway – an attraction in itself and an easy way to get around the city centre and West End. Single tickets cost from £1.50 (spt.co.uk).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Go from Cowcaddens station two stops west to Kelvin Bridge, for Eusebi Deli and Trattoria (152 Park Road), my favourite place for focaccia or a slice of pizza. For an evening meal try their Pasta Laboratory (eusebideli.com).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>AFTERNOON </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Take a stroll south across Kelvingrove Park, created by Sir Joseph Paxton, better known for the Crystal Palace. On its far edge is one of great public art collections, the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum (glasgowlife.org.uk). Glasgow solved the problem of how to make museums and galleries appeal to all by making this and all its collections lively, inviting and free. There’s a suspended Spitfire, paintings by French Impressionists and the ‘Glasgow Boys’, Scottish wildlife, prehistoric animals, Egyptian relics, and yet more Mackintosh. It’s a ten-minute walk to the new Riverside Museum of Transport (or take the 100 bus), designed by Zaha Hadid. This striking building, under a jagged, silvery roof, with a vast glass frontage on to the river, opened in 2011. Inside it’s a riot of trams, old cars, locomotives, a bike race high above your head, and war heroes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nearby is the new Science Centre, dominated by the 400ft-high Glasgow Tower, one of the world’s few fully rotating buildings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A way to join up many of the sites I’ve mentioned is on a sightseeing bus tour (citysightseeingglasgow.co.uk). The commentary on my bus from a real guide was wise, engaging and jolly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back in central Glasgow, find out why this is a Unesco-designated music city, the largest music economy in the UK after London. There are live performances every night, from Scottish Opera at Edington Street (scottishopera.org.uk) to rock and electronica.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I stayed the night at the Grand Central Hotel. Recently restored, it is one of the city’s most beautiful buildings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>DAY TWO </strong></p><img id="i-7ae04da5a98e4f15" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/15/4D12F46A00000578-0-image-a-89_1528554218962.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Educational: The Science Centre is another major attraction for visitors to Glasgow" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MORNING </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The glittering Burrell Collection, one of Britain’s top galleries, is closed until 2020 for a makeover, so I recommend a trip out to the tranquil House For An Art Lover in Bellahouston Park.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It opened in 1996, inspired by the original plans of Mackintosh. To get there, take the train from Central Station to Dumbreck (six minutes). Then it’s a ten-minute walk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After heading back to the city, take the City Centre Mural Trail. Street artists have brightened up tenements and hoardings around derelict land. Depicted on a massive scale are a fierce-looking tiger, a floating taxi, and a sunken Dalek in the Clyde.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then squeeze in time for a tour of the Glasgow School of Art (gsa.ac.uk) in Renfrew Street for the exhibition of Mackintosh’s furniture. The designer’s original building over the road, partly burned down in 2014, reopens next year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A good lunch spot is McCune Smith Cafe (3 Duke Street), named after James McCune Smith, a student in the city and the first African-American to gain a medical degree. (mccunesmith.co.uk).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>AFTERNOON</strong></p><img id="i-8b04c341d766636d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/15/4D12F45200000578-0-image-a-88_1528554183088.jpg" height="407" width="306" alt="The Wellington statue with cone (above) - his mount even sports one too" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s a different pulse to the city’s East End. Begin with a laugh, and spot the traffic cone always adorning the Duke of Wellington’s statue, next to the Gallery of Modern Art, just east of Buchanan Street. In the 1980s a cone mysteriously appeared on his head. Ever since, whenever a cone is removed, a new one appears. His mount often gets one too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Afterwards take the 263 bus to Glasgow Green, another of the great city parks. The big draw is the People’s Palace, with an exhibition celebrating Glasgow’s industrial past.fsci</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Continuing on, the next, and newest, East End attraction (take the CG1 bus from Megan Street to Sorn Street, then ten minutes on foot) is the remarkable Cuningar Loop Woodland Park, created from an urban wasteland in a loop in the River Clyde. It has paths, boardwalks and places to spot nature. (scotland.forestry.gov.uk).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Glasgow bursts with home-grown culinary talent. I like The Gannet (thegannetgla.com), housed in a once-derelict tenement building (1155 Argyle Street). Staff serve small bar plates and bigger dishes, at prices unthinkable in London. And all of the dishes contain Scottish ingredients only.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If The Gannet is full, there are plenty of alternatives. The Finnieston (1125 Argyle Street) is great for seafood and bespoke beers, and the Crabshakk (1114 Argyle Street), serves crab and lobster from the Western Isles.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-2c307890-6bef-11e8-8e06-93f6018b7004">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TRAVEL FACTS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Virgin Trains (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://virgintrains.co.uk/">virgintrains.co.uk</a>) offers one-way tickets from London to Glasgow from £30.

I’ll never forget the snakes, crabs and scorpions running across the sand. I actually got bitten by a spider, which gave me arachnophobia, and I’ve had a fear of spiders ever since. Apart from that, it was wonderful.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My first trip abroad: </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I moved back to England aged 12 after my South African granny died. I was born in England but I spent the bulk of my childhood in South Africa. My siblings and I all had strong South African accents and I remember my mother telling us: ‘You lot need to learn to speak properly!’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>First school trip: </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When I was about 16 and in the cadet force at Eton we went to an army base in Norway. My house captain, a keen army bloke, was in charge of ‘the enemy’ in the mountains during a summer exercise. A few years later I bumped into him and he said: ‘I heard you were in the SAS, and I’d like to do that.’ The next thing I knew he was commanding officer of the Special Forces unit!</p><div>

We spent our honeymoon at the Mount Everest base camp in Tibet, because May is the only time of the year you can climb the mountain and I was preparing for an attempt on the summit. It was an extremely bad idea as the camp was infested with rats and cockroaches and there was no privacy at all, day or night.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My best break:</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Voyaging down the Zambezi in a dugout canoe and retracing explorer David Livingstone’s epic journey to the Victoria Falls 150 years or so earlier. When we got to the waterfall we erected a bronze memorial to the great man.</p><img id="i-e86139c49b17673c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/13/4D12CA5E00000578-0-image-a-60_1528547373787.jpg" height="385" width="306" alt="Ranulph (above) as a boy in South Africa " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My worst holiday: </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The month-long honeymoon around Eastern Europe I took with my late first wife Ginny in 1970.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Nineteen-year-old Hero Douglas, granddaughter of the 12th Marquess of Queensberry, has a key family connection to the series of notorious events that brought down Oscar Wilde. With the release of a new film chronicling the sad final months of the great writer, Hero visits the city where Wilde died ‘beyond his means’… </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Writer and wit Oscar Wilde (deceased 1900) and The Doors frontman Jim Morrison (departed this life 1971) have been locked in an unlikely post-mortem struggle for supremacy at the Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other famous ‘residents’ here include Chopin, Edith Piaf and tragic lovers Abelard and Heloise: but while these are doughty A-listers, surprisingly none can hope to match the pulling power of Wilde or Morrison.</p><img id="i-c5d4ce34f1b985aa" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/11/4D12C9E500000578-0-image-a-36_1528540951420.jpg" height="442" width="634" alt="Ooh la la: Cruising along the river Seine by the Eiffel Tower in France's capital city " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those who monitor such things are now reporting that, in terms of visitor numbers, Wilde seems to be outpacing the once-dominant Morrison. And their combined tourist pulling power is reckoned to match the seven million who annually visit the Eiffel Tower – you have to pay for the Eiffel Tower, of course, while the cemetery is one of Paris’s great free attractions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There have long been signs that Wilde’s popularity was on the rise: so many visitors were leaving red lipstick kisses on the Derbyshire limestone used by designer Jacob Epstein for the tomb that the grease was eating it away. Wilde would have been delighted.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">So seven years ago, a protective glass screen was installed around the tomb. The tomb can expect to attract even greater attention over the coming months with the release on Friday of Rupert Everett’s Wilde biopic The Happy Prince – an agonising portrayal of Wilde’s final few years as a transient vagabond exiled in Europe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fleeting flashbacks give glimpses of the author’s immense success, but mostly Everett focuses on the jaded, love-torn spendthrift who admits: ‘I am dying beyond my means.’ The bow ties and bouquets of his former life are exchanged for bars and brothels as the movie embraces the tragedy of the great man’s decline.</p><img id="i-6f344eb649bd95ed" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/11/4D12CA8C00000578-0-image-a-38_1528541004450.jpg" height="461" width="306" alt="Literary icon: Oscar Wilde (above)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The tragedy has a particular resonance for me – the relationship between Wilde and my great-great-great-uncle, Bosie Douglas (the third son of the 9th Marquess of Queensberry), led to the court case which caused the author’s dramatic downfall: two years in Reading Gaol followed by the sordid, self-imposed exile in France and then his death. Travelling to Wilde’s Paris, therefore, was a very personal pilgrimage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Standing before the famous tomb was surprisingly moving. I pushed my lips against the screen and mouthed the word ‘sorry’. I can’t help but feel a familial guilt for the love-hate relationship that Wilde had with my ancestor which eventually destroyed him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Wilde connection is important to my family and my mother has frequently met his grandson Merlin, of whom she is very fond. I’ve had a book of Wilde’s witty phrases by my bed from early childhood, and last year I had the wonderful experience of playing Sybil in his play The Picture Of Dorian Gray, so this trip to Paris and paying my respects at his grave felt like the right thing to do.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Wilde came to France at the end of the 19th Century, it was a journey that involved a storm-tossed, cross-Channel ferry journey. How he would have enjoyed boarding a train at St Pancras instead for the two-and-a-half-hour journey to Gare du Nord. For Londoners, Paris is as easy to reach as Manchester.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While at Pere Lachaise I searched for Chopin’s burial site and took a moment to think of all his wonderful compositions that are so much a part of my life as a fresher studying music at Christ Church, Oxford.</p><img id="i-e0f5028c9bae77f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/11/4D12CA8000000578-0-image-a-30_1528540612700.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Rupert Everett (above) plays Oscar Wilde in the new biopic The Happy Prince " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I had wanted to find Edith Piaf and Jim Morrison, too, but the map was terrible (or perhaps it was just my navigational skills) and it was time to finish paying my respects to the deceased and make my way to L’Hotel, where I was staying. This was also the place where Wilde ended his days – with a joke of course: ‘My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death – one or the other of us has to go.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wilde died at the hotel in the Rue des Beaux Arts, aged just 46. Officially the cause of death was cerebral meningitis, although it has been suggested that he succumbed to syphilis (this gossip quickly attaches itself to any celebrity who dies after enjoying too much, too young).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m not sure what the wallpaper was like when Wilde was in residence and why he found it so deplorable, but these days it all seems rather tasteful. Also on display at the hotel is his final bill, accompanied by a letter from the manager inviting the author to pay it as soon as possible. Wilde couldn’t (‘I can’t even afford to die,’ he wailed) – the bill was finally settled two years after his death.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was worried it would feel a little macabre staying in the place where he died, but those thoughts vanished as soon as I walked through the front door of L’Hotel. It was like being transported into a glamorous, bygone era.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It wasn’t always such a wonderful place. I learned on my Oscar Wilde tour that, when he was languishing there in the final months of his life, L’Hotel was grimy budget accommodation frequented by prostitutes and undesirables.</p><img id="i-76f41e65ec17eba0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/08/4D12C9E900000578-5824243-Dazzling_The_Louvre_is_one_of_the_top_tourist_attractions_in_Par-a-2_1528788721972.jpg" height="253" width="634" alt="Dazzling: The Louvre is one of the top tourist attractions in Paris and is home to the Mona Lisa" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its wonderful domed ceiling was open to the elements and when it rained those in the communal areas got wet as well.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The dining area is now beautifully restored with luscious décor and a very grand glass roof. I really enjoyed my seven course surprise tasting menu paired with a vintage Pinot Noir, Pouilly Fume and a 2013 Grenache. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Everything about L’Hotel is spectacular and this is why it’s included in the Chic Retreats portfolio, the company set up by Lulu Townsend for the discerning traveller.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lulu had a similar childhood to mine growing up in a hotel (a B&amp;B in my case) and so knows the meticulous attention to detail and charm needed to create wonderful places to stay. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She has a passion for unique, small independent properties and doesn’t believe stars or rosettes necessarily make a hotel special and so she finds unique properties which tend to be run by owners and are ‘labour of love places to stay’, where the entire focus is on keeping guests comfortable and happy. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chic Retreats really do offer the antidote to hours of trawling bland, generic travel websites and with them you’re fast tracked straight to a truly special place to stay. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lulu has curated a simply marvellous selection of exceptional boutique hotels from around the world making for perfect holidays.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the great pleasures of staying at L’Hotel is that you are only a stone’s-throw from the world’s largest art museum, the Louvre. I made a beeline, along with every other tourist it seems, to see Da Vinci’s masterpiece, the Mona Lisa.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Smaller than I imagined, I joined in the sashaying of the visitors from one side of the room to the other, and yes, her eyes do seem to follow you wherever you stand. This was obviously the most crowded room, but I was surprised how tranquil many of the other areas were, even though they contained ancient Greek and Roman treasures, works by Old Masters and Egyptian antiquities.</p><img id="i-8992ec4483ed35de" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/08/4D12CA4E00000578-5824243-Lipstick_kisses_The_author_s_limestone_tomb_at_Pere_Lachaise_cem-a-1_1528788721918.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Lipstick kisses: The author's limestone tomb at Pere Lachaise cemetery " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">After hours focusing on art, it was time for a break – and a boat trip with Bateaux Parisiens along the Seine. It was a wonderfully relaxing way to see Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower without having to take a step.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I tried to live up to the Wilde dream by enjoying some very agreeable meals and the occasional strong drink, but as a 19-year old I found that bars were surprisingly reluctant to serve me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One evening I joined friends as we shivered outside a seemingly closed barber shop. I was trying to get into the exclusive bar Gentlemen 1919 and had been given a number to call on arrival.</p><img id="i-3976de930b6f4eef" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/11/4D12CA6300000578-0-image-a-34_1528540661863.jpg" height="408" width="306" alt="Raising a glass: Hero saluted Wilde during her Paris adventure " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once I’d followed my instructions, a suave man appeared to unlock the security grilles and led us through the nondescript entrance to the secretive, legendary cocktail bar within.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I ordered a Pornstar martini – a combination of champagne, passion fruit and sweet vanilla vodka. It must have been strong as I can only remember snippets of the rest of the night. I’m sure Wilde would have approved.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another night ended in the early hours at Le Duc de Lombards, a great jazz club where I saw the incredible Clayton Brothers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Parisian high life is not for the frugal, as Wilde sadly discovered in his final months. But the great man would have wanted me to enjoy La Vie Parisienne in its finest form, whatever the cost. And, of course, he had a great quote for every situation: ‘What is a cynic? A man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I advise all visitors to Paris to go Wilde in Paris.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Europe has some enthralling coastlines - and there is no better way to explore them than by foot.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But where to start?

In addition to passing high above rocky coves and along stark cliffs that plunge into the Atlantic Ocean, you’ll be surrounded by more than 200 species of flora and fauna.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Look out for dazzling displays of mauves, pinks and whites. There are views of sister island Porto Santo to the north and the serrated outline of Desertas Islands to the south-east.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>HOW TO DO IT:</strong> Madeira Choice (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://madeirachoice.com/">madeirachoice.com</a>, 01768 721040) offers four nights at the Quintinha Sao Joao in Funchal from £698 pp.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>IBIZA’S CELEB CIRCUIT</strong></strong></p><img id="i-988904b89af054ba" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/10/4D1315F100000578-0-image-a-14_1528536185365.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Stunning: Watch the sun set over the Es Vedra, a huge limestone rock on Ibiza’s south-west coast (above)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The six-mile Es Vedra walk snakes its way around Ibiza’s south-west coast. Start at tranquil Es Cubells, leading to expansive views of the bay and villa where actress Ursula Andress lived in the Seventies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The road soon fizzles out, turning into a precarious path along the cliffside.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You’ll be rewarded with the sight of Cala Llentrisca, a pristine cove accessible only by boat or foot. Take a quick dip here, before the path continues up the valley.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the trail’s highest point, 1,200 ft above sea level, watch the sun set with the final rays illuminating Es Vedra, a huge limestone rock.

It’s a glorious four-mile walk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Because of its 19th-century origins as a coastguard patrol route to restrict smuggling, the footpath in places runs perilously close to the edge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is a magical corner of Exmoor. Legend has it that the spiky rock formations, with names such as Ragged Jack and Devil’s Cheesewring, are the work of the devil.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>HOW TO DO IT:</strong> Bay Valley of Rocks Hotel, Lynton (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://bayhotels.co.uk/">bayhotels.co.uk</a>, 01598 752349) has double rooms from £79 pp half-board.</p><div>

This wilderness has few marked footpaths, so most visitors walk with a guide.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A boat crossing from the town of Isafjordur cuts through the choppy water en route to the deserted village of Saebol, the start of a ten-mile hike.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You may catch the wonderful display of minke whale breaching in the bay’s icy waters, particularly in summer.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The ITV2 programme <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/tvshowbiz/love-island/index.html">Love Island</a> may be an acquired taste (dumb blondes, buff blokes, inane chatter), but it seems to be doing wonders for Majorca.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bookings and internet searches are up and I dare say there’s been a run on fake tans, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The villa where all the cuddling up takes place is in the north-east — which, as it happens, is only ten miles or so from where we are staying, in unspoilt countryside, around an hour’s drive from <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/news/spain/index.html">Palma</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Scroll down for videos </strong></p><img id="i-f3da41f39711ef31" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/08/4D12CA1C00000578-0-image-a-1_1528530108028.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The harbour in Palma at twilight (above).

Shame if they aren’t.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Palma is like Barcelona was 20 years ago. That’s what we garner from two different sources, albeit both connected to the Majorca tourist trade.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That might be overstating things. But for those who see the world through the prism of food, there is some supporting evidence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chefs are settling here in large numbers (there are already two Michelin-star restaurants), the food market is on all the tourist itineraries and the trendy boutique hotels are touting their expansive nosh as much as their minimalist decor.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">That’s not all. Like Barcelona, Palma gets busy. Or, rather, insufferably crowded when the cruise ships unload their human cargo after breakfast.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And then there’s the Antoni Gaudi connection. His most famous work is, of course, the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona — but he caused an unholy rumpus here in 1904-14 when he embarked on a revamp of Palma’s Gothic cathedral, outraging the Catholic hierarchy in the process.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Make up your own mind about the vegetable mosaics either side of the bishop’s throne and the interpretation of the feeding of the 5,000 by way of Miquel Barcelo’s wacky installation in one of the ante-chapels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it’s a magnificent building, high on the town’s fortifications overlooking the bay. Everyone goes to the cathedral, but not everyone calls in at the nearby Museu Fundacion Juan March, showcasing the March family’s contemporary art collection, including a Picasso and several Miros and Dalis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">March, who died in 1962, was a bounder of the highest order who became Spain’s richest man. His entrepreneurial skills were honed at school when he charged classmates for cigarettes by the puff.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During World War II, he loaned Franco money, while the British paid him to keep Spain neutral.</p><img id="i-7a507c9e0f3768b6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/08/4D12CA2400000578-0-image-a-2_1528530168466.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Making a splash: One of the suites at peaceful Pleta de Mar, which is owned by a local family" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s worth having a guide in Palma. We meet Antonio Bouzas via the agency MallorcanTonic (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://mallorcantonic.com/">mallorcantonic.com</a>). Before he leaves us to our own hungry devices in the market, he first recommends a few of his favourite stalls, where we graze happily and wonder why on earth such good, wholesome and cheap fast food is not available in our own country.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are plenty of places to stay in Palma, but we’re thrilled to be billeted at Pleta de Mar, some 40 miles away. It has only been open a year, but already exudes five-star confidence and joyful serenity. Owned by a local family (they have three other hotels on the island, one of which is within walking distance), it was built from scratch using natural stone, marble and bamboo-lined ceilings and includes some 30 suites (all with their own terraces) spread out in such a way that you don’t feel it’s a hotel at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s no signage, no particular meal times and no children are allowed. This is not the sort of place where people bellow into mobile phones while applying suncream to tubby tummies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And I don’t imagine many of the guests are Love Island fans, either. Everywhere, there are wafting grasses, clipped lawns, sandy paths (one leading down to a rocky beach), birdsong and pine trees. One of the three swimming pools looks like a natural pond.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’re a group of three couples. Which means it makes sense to split the cost of a half-day out on the hotel’s boat, exploring the pretty coast northwards, stopping for a swim and enjoying an on-board picnic lunch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pretty hilltop town of Arta is about 15 minutes away. It’s popular with Germans and there’s a lively market on Tuesday and Friday evenings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While some of our party peruse Arta’s shops, others of us climb up to the Santuari de Sant Salvador church, a pilgrimage of sorts, from where there are spectacular views of the entire Es Pla valley, with mountains in one direction and the Mediterranean Sea in the other. We eat cheaply in a little square below the church, before returning to base, where we sit under the stars and drink far too much whisky.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The conversation reverts to Gaudi and we wonder what he might do to Pleta de Mar given half a chance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No doubt he would come up with something fanciful — but we’re convinced he couldn’t improve it.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-67739200-6bb5-11e8-b252-0b0e5c8ffd9a">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TRAVEL FACTS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Spanish Expressions (01392 441276, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://expressionholidays.co.uk/">expressionholidays.co.uk</a>) offers three nights’ bed and breakfast in a suite at the Pleta de Mar, including return flights from Heathrow, from £1,230 pp. For more information about the island, visit <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://infomallorca.net/">infomallorca.net</a>.</p>                            </div>                        </div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The Daily Mail's Mark Palmer visited Majorca, where the ITV2 show Love Island is filmed.

and mum and dad to be honest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are a number of sports offered, such as tennis, pool and beach volleyball, beach soccer, water polo, and more.</p><img id="i-cb7a54572fe1f3e3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/10/4CD6A7F500000578-0-image-a-12_1527931263195.jpg" height="542" width="962" alt="Spanish restaurant Tapaz proved to be a favourite with the Parry clan, thanks to its 'delicious' food" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-449b0edb7d75c649" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/10/4CD69F4300000578-0-image-a-22_1527931318702.jpg" height="722" width="962" alt="Ryan's son was fascinated with the live crayfish at the delicious Zavaz Caribbean restaurant" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-d9549a5cf221f493" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/10/4CD6A08300000578-0-image-a-17_1527931285491.jpg" height="627" width="470" alt="Ryan and his wife get into the spirit of the occasion" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">My wife, Emma, enjoyed Jorge’s yoga class and the Spanish class with Alex.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If it’s ocean activities you’re looking for then the sports hut on the beach offers kayaking and snorkeling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The water is very shallow and filled with a wide assortment of unique sea plants and intriguing sea-life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other exercise classes included Beach Boot Camp, and Aqua Gym.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And then there are several other activity options such as dance, cocktail, and Texas Hold’em, cooking classes and pottery decorating.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One day we took advantage of the babysitting facilities on offer and enjoyed some adult-time in the Vassa spa.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We enjoyed a dry sauna, whirlpool, spa boutique and juice bar before trying a relaxing massage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s even a 'Perfectly Pink' spa suite just for the younger children and teens -

was a fun bonding experience and made for some classic pictures of us screaming our heads off, covered in green liquid.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there’s the free Azulitos kids’ club — open every day with supervised sessions for four-12 year olds and stay and play facilities for the younger ones.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Corben couldn’t wait to enter the huge orange playhouse for crafts, games and other activities, which included making ice cream, Silly Science Lab, and lounging around in a huge ball pit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Being a Nickelodeon club an array of toys featured on the kids’ channel were available to play with, such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Dora the Explorer and Corben’s favourite Paw Patrol.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was even a toy library where you could borrow a toy to take to your room.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The resort offered a practically perfect marriage between kids’ and adults’ ideal vacations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes it can take some effort to hang out with Dora, Paw Patrol, and the other Nick characters, but it's worth it to see the kids smile.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By the time evening came around we were often pretty tired from our action-packed days - but even the kids wanted to stay up late to watch the nightly shows.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Again this was no ordinary holiday entertainment, we enjoyed a circus, a fire show, a cute puppet show and high quality tribute acts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For families with young kids this was the perfect summer break.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Flying here is no problem with direct flights from seven UK airports flying on the spacious new Dreamliner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even months later my little boy always asks 'When can we go back to Mexico?' and to be honest we often think the same thing. </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-1527ba80-6642-11e8-9e2b-07ca64a04db3">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TRAVEL FACTS</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                            <p class="mol-para-with-font">For more information on the Tui Sensatori Resort Azul click <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.tui.co.uk/destinations/caribbean/mexico/mexico-caribbean-coast/riviera-maya/hotels/tui-sensatori-resort-riviera-cancun.html">here</a>.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Holidays usually give people the opportunity to relax, unwind and recharge their batteries.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But before they even arrive at their hotel, scammers at airports can put a spanner in the works. And they can strike as they go through the departures security system.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To help tourists avoid being duped Palma Airport has produced a handy guide to the most common scams lurking at airports, from the 'queue staller' to the 'suitcase helper'.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The queue staller</strong></p><img id="i-934fb1615a97e4c5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/4CF9196500000578-5812463-image-m-35_1528290742539.jpg" height="1285" width="634" alt="An infographic showing how tourists travelling through airports can be scammed when travelling" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The queue to go through airport security is one of the most likely places where scammers will strike.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their devious ploy is to work in pairs, with one person holding up the queue at the X-ray machine - and the other going through and taking belongings before the owner can get to them. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To ensure this doesn't happen, travellers should make sure they keep their eyes on the belt at all times.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They should watch for anyone loitering suspiciously and alert a guard if necessary.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The distractor</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a similar move, thieves often try to distract travellers in a bid to get them to move away from their suitcases.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once this happens, an accomplice to the distractor will move in and make off with any unattended luggage that contains mobile phones or other important documents.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Security experts suggest never packing all of your valuables in one place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The 'free' wifi scam</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most airports offer free wifi so passengers can check up on their emails or social media.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But sometimes the networks aren't safe and have actually been set up by hackers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This means they can then access travellers' devices and steal personal information such as bank account details and account passwords.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The baggage carousel 'bump'</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The baggage carousel is another prime location that scammers target.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here holidaymakers should watch that they don't fall prey to the 'bump and run' scam.</p><img id="i-c736b2d7b1d8b206" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/4CF9196500000578-5812463-image-m-37_1528290790185.jpg" height="695" width="634" alt="The baggage carousel is a prime location that scammers target" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">This ploy is when a thief bumps into someone and quickly apologises - and steals a wallet or purse while the owner is distracted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However frustrating passengers find the baggage carousel, and however tired or impatient they are feeling, they should make sure that their valuables are safely tucked away and that they are vigilant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They should also make sure they keep their eyes on the carousel to make sure no one makes off with their luggage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The suitcase 'helper'</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When travelling with heavy luggage a friendly person offering to help can seem like a welcome gesture.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But often these 'helpful people' will refuse to give back passengers' luggage when they reach their airport transport unless they are given money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Experts say that the only people who should assist holidaymakers with luggage are official airport porters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The pickpocket</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With most tourists having their wallets, mobile phones and passports to hand, it is easy for pickpockets to strike.</p><img id="i-e50644d2e181216a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/4CF9196500000578-5812463-image-m-40_1528290859375.jpg" height="700" width="634" alt="Wallets, mobile phones and passports shoved into pockets make for tempting prizes for pickpockets" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once they have their baggage, they wander around looking for car rental desks, exit signs or somewhere to get a drink.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While distracted, pickpockets are waiting to grab valuables that have been shoved into pockets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Experts suggest fastening bags, not putting anything valuable in the pockets of suitcases and keeping anything of value inside jacket pockets or handbags.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The mobile phone scam</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As many travellers want to avoid roaming charges, renting a mobile phone in the country they are visiting may seem like a good idea.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And vendors will say that they will give back any security deposit for a phone when it is returned.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, what some bogus vendors don't tell customers is that the devices have extortionate charges. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These vendors should be treated with caution and holidaymakers should steer clear of credit card payphones at all costs.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They don’t show any charges and can end up costing an absolute fortune.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The false greeter</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If passengers arrive at their destination and haven't booked a transfer but someone is waiting for them with a name card then they should beware.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This could be an elaborate scam cooked up by taxi drivers to drive them part way and then demand a hefty fee to take them any further.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Similarly if passengers do have transfers arranged, they should take care to make sure the person greeting them is genuine.</p><img id="i-287f47640037ee33" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/4CF9196500000578-5812463-image-m-42_1528290886834.jpg" height="1152" width="634" alt="When travelling from the airport to a destination by taxi, scam drivers may claim that their meter is broken" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile the imposter security officer is also something passengers need to be particularly aware of. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, they may seem like a security officer but scammers can dress up and pretend to be officials who then demand travellers pay an on-the-spot fine in return for letting them go free.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The bluetooth sting</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most people forget to turn off the bluetooth mode on their mobile phones, especially when they are relaxing on holiday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But when it is left on 'discoverable' airport hackers can easily pair with the device.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once they do this, they can steal information or even install a virus.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The broken taxi meter</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When travelling from the airport to a destination by taxi, scam drivers may claim that their meter is broken.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This can be a ploy to overcharge someone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To avoid this happening, travellers should agree on a price before they get into the car.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another common taxi scam is for the driver to take the 'scenic route'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While road design, traffic hold ups or road works can force a driver to take a longer-than-normal route, there are some occasions where a driver knows that some holidaymakers may not be aware if they are literally being taken for a ride.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman for Palma Airport said: 'Security at airports has tightened up a lot these days, and Palma de Mallorca PMI is no exception.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Of course, we are not trying to scare you and put you off travelling, as Palma de Mallorca PMI is one of the safest airports in the world, and its unlikely you will be scammed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But saying that, when in a foreign country, it is always wise to have your wits about you and make sure that you are extra vigilant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Book everything yourself, keep an eye on your luggage and make sure you keep your valuables safe and everything should be just fine and you can then relax and enjoy your holiday.' </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>To help tourists avoid being duped on arrival Palma Airport has produced a

Every aspect of an aircraft, including the materials, systems and overall design are checked and verified as part of the certification process. The latter is conducted by an external authority with the power to insist on changes, and if necessary to ground an aircraft. Not only is the design proven, but pilots, cabin crew and maintenance engineers are all trained and must pass rigorous checks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In describing the aircraft as a whole, there is a back-up for almost everything. The body of the aircraft, wings and flight controls make up the structure. The engines provide the power and propel the aircraft through the air and run all on-board systems - hydraulic, air, electrical and avionics systems.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These in turn make sure that aircraft can be flown safely from the flight deck, the engine gets enough fuel and the cabin stays at normal pressure and temperature. There are back-up systems for the landing gear and brakes, plus fire protection and emergency oxygen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Almost all on-board systems are duplicated on a modern aircraft, so that failure of any one system should not cause an aircraft accident.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the design basics is that there should be no 'single-point' failures. Such systems include the principle of 'redundancy' so that an aircraft remains controllable in the event of a system or component not working.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jet aircraft typically fly at between 32,000 and 38,000 feet (six and seven miles) high for most flights, where the engines are most efficient and there is less air resistance. The main body of an aircraft (fuselage) is a large cylindrical tube, which is the strongest and most efficient way to withstand the low air pressure at these altitudes. The materials used are well tested and structural failures are very rare. Those that do occur have been due to an error in operation or maintenance. </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ailerons make the aircraft turn and so without these, flight becomes more difficult.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, it is still possible to turn the aircraft using the rudder.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Air-conditioning (AC) pack</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pressurisation is required so that passengers have air to breathe whilst the aircraft is flying at high altitude. For this reason all aircraft have two AC packs in case of failure. If one fails, the aircraft must descend just in case the other one were also to fail. Without any pressurisation, oxygen masks would drop and the aircraft would make an emergency descent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Hydraulic systems</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are normally three separate hydraulic systems on a large aircraft and these are the primary way to move the flight controls (rudder, elevator, ailerons and flaps etc). It is therefore essential that at least one hydraulic system is available, otherwise the aircraft cannot be controlled. As mentioned above, it has been shown that in exceptional cases, the engines can be used to steer the aircraft, but this has only worked in one or two cases.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Electrical systems</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are a number of separate electrical systems on the aircraft, each of which powers different systems. Again, the objective is to increase safety by making sure that essential systems will still operate if part of the electrical system fails. One action that might occur is that in-flight entertainment and other non-essential items might be switched off to conserve power.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Autopilot</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The autopilot helps the aircraft to fly automatically. There are still two pilots but they do not have to hold on to all the controls. There are normally two autopilot systems, because without  them the plane would need to be 'hand-flown'. Pilots are able to do this easily, but it is impractical for a long flight. It would also mean that certain complex approaches in bad weather may be prohibited.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Radios</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are at least two or three radio systems on the aircraft to enable communication with the ground, air traffic control etc. Special procedures exist for what to do if a plane loses the ability to communicate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Wheels and brakes</strong></p><img id="i-9a540bad4af8502c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/12/4CE64AEE00000578-5803149-A_LOT_767_made_a_safe_emergency_landing_in_Warsaw_after_the_land-a-33_1528111696817.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="A Lot 767 made a safe emergency landing in Warsaw after the landing gear failed to come down" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The aircraft landing gear is designed to support the weight of the aircraft when landing and provide braking.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As well as wheel brakes, aircraft also have 'reverse thrust' from the engines to slow the aircraft when it lands.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From time to time, landing gear failures do occur, either partially or completely. It is not possible to have a back-up for the undercarriage wheels. However, there have been some remarkable examples of the pilot and aircraft coping with unusual events.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In one extreme case, an aircraft landed with no landing gear at all. This happened to a Lot 767 at Warsaw in 2011, where the landing gear did not come down due to a hydraulic leak. After flying around and trying to find the problem, a landing was attempted and the aircraft effectively skidded to a halt on the runway. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were no injuries during the emergency. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the case of Tam A332 at New York in September 2012, the nose gear can be seen to be at 90 degrees to the direction of flight, during the first attempt to land. On the final approach, and just before landing, the nose gear straightened just before the aircraft touched down.</p><img id="i-2a9c641729859151" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/12/4CE64AF300000578-5803149-A_TAM_A332_at_New_York_in_September_2012_made_one_approach_with_-a-32_1528111696790.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="A Tam A332 at New York in September 2012 made one approach with the nose gear at 90 degrees to the direction of flight" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2005, a Jet Blue Airbus A320 landed at Los Angeles, California, with the nose gear at 90 degrees. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite generating a shower of sparks, as the rubber was worn away, the aircraft made a controlled landing with no fire and no injuries on board.<strong> </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Dr Simon Place is a Senior Lecturer at the </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/Centres/Safety-and-Accident-Investigation-Centre"><span class="mol-style-italic">Safety and Accident Investigation Centre, Cranfield University</span></a><span class="mol-style-italic">.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Castle Ward was Winterfell for the first series only – scenes are now shot at an enormous custom-built set deep in the County Antrim countryside. However, there are plenty of other attractions in Northern Ireland to excite fans. The Dark Hedges – an avenue of beech trees planted in the 18th Century – form an atmospheric tunnel known as the King’s Road. And Shane’s Castle, on the shores of Lough Neagh, was where the Hand’s Tourney was staged.</p><img id="i-a4f4769d20344258" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/15/4CD65B3200000578-0-image-a-55_1527949208088.jpg" height="460" width="306" alt="Bran and Jon (above) in the hit TV show" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even if you are not glued to the many plot twists and turns, the trail will still be an adventure.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Glamorous camping, or glamping, is all the rage. Such holidays promise all the excitement and adventure of sleeping in the great outdoors without the discomfort of bedding down under damp canvas with only a bucket for a bathroom.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jonathan Knight, founder of new website glampingly.co.uk, says the popularity of such breaks has rocketed partly because there has been a much greater appreciation of the outdoors over the past decade – perhaps as a reaction to all the technology around us. ‘Glamping is also easier and more comfortable than regular camping and appeals to more people,’ he says. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There’s no need to own or store camping gear, so even city-dwellers can enjoy the lifestyle perks of camping – the fires, the sunsets, the countryside. That makes glamping perfect for shorter breaks, too – you turn up and relax from the minute you arrive.’</p><img id="i-c3b54163844a089a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/13/4CD7663700000578-5797997-image-a-2_1527943812338.jpg" height="560" width="962" alt="Jonathan Knight, founder of new website glampingly.co.uk, says the popularity of glamping breaks has rocketed partly because there has been a much greater appreciation of the outdoors over the past decade (file image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Greater demand has resulted in the creation of many more glamping venues all over the country, many in fantastically picturesque, away-from-it-all locations. More competition has led to greater innovation, too, so you can stay in everything from horseboxes and giant beehives, to a double-decker bus, a treehouse and even a full-size helicopter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some aren’t cheap, but they may include luxuries such as hot tubs, fire pits and open-air showers. Others have fewer facilities and are short on space, but they represent great value and fun for families, and are close to open countryside and attractions. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here are some of the best glamping ideas. It’s best to check exactly what is provided before you book, and prices quoted are per night unless otherwise stated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>BEST FOR TREE-HUGGERS</strong></p><img id="i-fd7d63f33406e301" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/10/4CD65B2200000578-0-The_treehouse_in_Dorset-a-30_1527932778446.jpg" height="845" width="962" alt="This treehouse (above) is located in Yonder Hill, West Dorset, and is the 'ultimate in hideaways', says Wendy Gomersall" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-559f27bdc17ae39d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/10/4CD65B1A00000578-0-The_treehouse_luxurious_bath-a-29_1527932778425.jpg" height="1059" width="962" alt="Stunning: The treehouse comes with a double-ended luxurious copper bath with incredible views of the woodland " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Where:</strong> Crafty Camping, Yonder Hill, Holditch, West Dorset.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What makes it special:</strong> The ultimate in hideaways, this ultra-cool, luxurious, handcrafted treehouse for two isn’t cheap but it comes with a double-ended copper bath, open-air shower, spiral staircase leading to a spa deck with hot tub and sauna, and even a pizza oven.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Children welcome? </strong>No, it’s adults-only.

A happy family sit around a blazing fire with no one else in sight. Since it was born at the height of the California flowerpower era, that seductive fantasy has remained a bucketlist aspiration for many of us. It looks so easy – but the 21st Century reality of the hippy holiday dream takes a little more thought. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My first campervan trip ended with me sleeping in a borrowed tent because the kids hated sleeping in the ‘roof’ beds. So make sure you pick the right motorhome. A modern vehicle may not have the appeal of the VW original but it can be a lot more comfortable. And rather than a beautiful empty beach, you could end up in a noisy campsite miles from the sea. So here are ten tips to help you avoid the pitfalls… </p><img id="i-b7202a1fc7a86f85" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/12/4CD65B1600000578-5797997-Freedom_A_vintage_campervan_parked_up_on_an_empty_pebbled_beach_-a-35_1527940183925.jpg" height="610" width="914" alt="Freedom: A vintage campervan parked up on an empty pebbled beach (above)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1. KEEP IT SIMPLE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’re new to motorhoming, try a simple campervan experience first. Hire a vehicle for a weekend and drive to the nearest National Park or seaside. Even then you’ll need to research where you can park for the night – you can’t just stop anywhere you fancy. Campsites offer facilities but may not fit your wild camping fantasy. Sites such as <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://park4night.com/">park4night.com</a> have lots of suggestions for more edgy overnight spots. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. BOOK YOUR HOME EARLY</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before you make too many plans, make sure you can get your campervan – there is a limited range available, so do book early. You can find all sorts of motorhomes at the dedicated comparison site <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://cheapmotorhomes.co.uk/">cheapmotorhomes.co.uk</a>. For a classic VW Camper, try <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://camperbug.co.uk/">camperbug.co.uk</a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. TAKE THINGS SLOWLY </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any sort of motorhome will be slower and more unwieldy to drive than you are used to. American- style motorhomes need special care – they can be a couple of feet wider than a car. The first time I tried to park a campervan, I crashed it into my own car. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4. DON’T FORGET ESSENTIALS </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Check what is included with the hire vehicle and make a list of what you need to bring. Don’t spend a bank holiday looking for a shop that sells tin-openers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5. ENJOY THE FREEDOM</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You may plan a route, but once you’re out there, there’s no need to stick to any schedule. It takes a bit of getting used to amid our finely timetabled lives, but the whole point of the campervan dream is that you can stop for an extra day to enjoy anything you stumble upon – or simply drive off to discover something new. </p><img id="i-1c094197eeab63e7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/12/4CD7307500000578-5797997-Plan_your_meals_and_buy_food_in_advance_says_The_Mail_on_Sunday_-a-37_1527940338853.jpg" height="610" width="914" alt="Plan your meals and buy food in advance, says The Mail on Sunday's Simon Heptinstall. But remember to think about things that you can cook in cramped circumstances" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>6. GO WITH PEOPLE YOU LIKE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You’ll be stuck next to the other passengers for days, so if you must invite friends, make sure they’re good ones. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>7. PLAN YOUR MEALS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unless your holiday dream involves non-stop takeaways, plan meals and buy food in advance. Think about things that you can cook in cramped circumstances, and remember storage might be limited. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>8. PREPARE TO EXTEND</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My own first motorhome experience showed I needed more space immediately. So awnings and tents are a great idea. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>9. AVOID MESS STRESS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The secret of staying in a confined space is to keep everything in its place. Don’t spend the holiday looking for matches or socks: regularly putting things away will save hours of can’t-find-it angst later. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>10. STAY WARM</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the campervan fantasy, everyone wore shorts – but in the UK that might not do. Be sure to bring warm clothes and lots of blankets to use at night. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic"><strong>By Simon Heptinstall</strong></span></p>                            </div>                        </div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Here's our pick of the best 'glamping' sites in the UK.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">It's the age of the wow factor when flying business class these days with airlines offering the likes of double beds and bars when you turn left.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Delta Air Lines doesn't have either, but it does serve one of the most downright delicious Cuban pork sandwiches to those paying top whack on its flights.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to the World Health Organisation, Africa and South-East Asia have the highest burden of food borne diseases per population.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Are there any things that travellers should avoid while they are away?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is some evidence to say an upset stomach is going to be an unwelcome visitor in the first seven days after arrival at a destination.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But if you take extra care during the first week, you should be just fine to enjoy your holiday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remember hot and humid countries are going to carry more bugs on their food and in their water.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Never drink tap water</strong></p><img id="i-35b0fe1c3594c2ab" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/16/4CC275AB00000578-5787433-image-a-9_1527694613706.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Dr Daniel says avoiding tap water is one way to avoid falling ill. She advises always drinking bottled water " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">That goes for brushing your teeth. It goes for ice in your drinks. It goes for fruit that's washed in tap water. Always drink bottled water, ensuring the seal is intact when you purchase it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Avoid certain food</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remember sauces, condiments to street foods and so on may be watered down using tap water.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ensure all food you eat is hot, cooked at the right temperature to ensure the bacteria are taken care of.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avoid salads and food that's been sat out at buffets for instance. Uncooked seafood is a common culprit in many developed countries like Spain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Eat where the locals go</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While indulging in local street food may make you feel like you are immersing yourself in the indigenous culture, this stuff is usually not subject to the same sanitary standards as a restaurant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hedge your bets on the one with a queue of locals. Check for cleanliness even in established restaurants, paying attention to the state of tablecloths, cutlery, glasses and whether the tables are wiped down properly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Wash your hands</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is the next most effective way of preventing sickness on holiday, next to drinking bottled water.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Always wash your hands with soap and water where possible. If the tap water is suspect, make sure you carry alcohol gel or wipes with you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Stick to peelable fruit</strong></p><img id="i-2e00d837b0d6949a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/16/4CC2759D00000578-5787433-image-a-10_1527694633521.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The best fruit to eat while away is peelable fruit such as bananas, pineapple and mangoes" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bananas, mangoes and the like are perfectly fine to eat. Avoid anything that has already been peeled, chopped and is waiting in handy takeaway sizes for you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Eat smaller amounts</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Simple maths. Less bugs in the body, less harmful effect on it. Also gives your body more time to deal with it if the incoming food poisoning causing bugs are in small quantities.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What are the main symptoms of food poisoning, and are there any ways that you can ease these?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The main symptoms of food poisoning are diarrhoea and vomiting. This may or may not be associated with fevers and shivers. Sometimes you may also have a stomach ache. Fatigue, headaches and muscle aches are also possible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What should you do if you begin to experience the symptoms of food poisoning?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you do experience an upset stomach, make sure to drink plenty of fluids.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sticking to water where possible or dilute juices. Carbonated drinks may make you feel worse. Stick to paracetamol for fever, aches and tummy pain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eat bland foods like plain rice, soup, plain toast. Bananas and apples will help bulk up stools. It may be worth drinking oral rehydration fluids. They usually come in sachets for you to reconstitute.</p><img id="i-cb40d9eccd34f3be" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/16/4CC2759800000578-5787433-image-a-11_1527694639369.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Dr Daniel says it is worth seeking medical help if you have prolonged diarrhoea, severe stomach pains or high fever" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS travel" data-version="2" id="mol-0b79d220-64a3-11e8-b6c2-471b94e773d2">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Where are you most likely to get food poisoning on holiday? </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) African and South-East Asian regions have the highest burden of foodborne diseases, though because of their popularity with holidaymakers, countries such as Spain, Mexico and India are also often associated with dodgy stomachs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The WHO says that one in 10 people (600million globally) fall ill every year from eating contaminated food and 420,000 die as a result.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Children under five years of age are at particularly high risk, with 125,000 children dying from foodborne diseases every year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Diarrhoeal diseases are responsible for more than half of the global burden of foodborne diseases, causing 550 million people to fall ill and 230 000 deaths every year. Children are at particular risk of foodborne diarrhoeal diseases, with 220 million falling ill and 96 000 dying every year. Diarrhoea is often caused by eating raw or undercooked meat, eggs, fresh produce and dairy products contaminated by norovirus, Campylobacter, non-typhoidal Salmonella and pathogenic E. coli.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other major contributors to the global burden of foodborne diseases are typhoid fever, hepatitis A, Taenia solium (a tapeworm), and aflatoxin (produced by mould on grain that is stored inappropriately).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Certain diseases, such as those caused by non-typhoidal Salmonella, are a public health concern across all regions of the world, in high- and low-income countries alike. Other diseases, such as typhoid fever, foodborne cholera, and those caused by pathogenic E. coli, are much more common to low-income countries, while Campylobacter is an important pathogen in high-income countries.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The risk of foodborne diseases is most severe in low and middle-income countries, linked to preparing food with unsafe water; poor hygiene and inadequate conditions in food production and storage; lower levels of literacy and education; and insufficient food safety legislation or implementation of such legislation, the WHO said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What are the best treatment options available? Are there any essentials that you should pack, or look out for while you are in a foreign country?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bearing in mind most gastroenteritis or upset stomachs tend to be because of common viruses, it does not need any medical treatment. It is always worth packing anti-sickness tablets, paracetamol and oral rehydration sachets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Loperamide or Imodium is OK to take if necessary but remember if there are bugs making toxins in your bowels as can happen during a diarrhoeal illness, you want these toxins out. Keeping them bunged up can cause swelling in your bowel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How long should you wait if you are experiencing the symptoms before seeking medical help?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Typically, 48 hours is a viral diarrhoea, but it can vary depending on what is causing it. If you stay hydrated, avoid triggers and keep your diet bland, the symptoms should disappear on their own.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is worth seeking medical help if you have prolonged diarrhoea, severe stomach pains, high fever, blood in your stools or you are unable to drink fluids.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Is there anything that you can request from your doctor prior to flying out to prevent food poisoning, and how would you know where to look for medical support if you are in a foreign country?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rather than seeing a doctor before flying, see your practice nurse. They will recommend all the necessary travel vaccines for your destination that will prevent you from having severe bacterial illness. They will also give you general travel advice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is worth considering malaria prophylaxis if needed. I would suggest considering probiotic supplements (they come in capsule form in health food shops) to help prevent diarrhoea. These can help viral and some bacterial gastroenteritis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Always carry adequate travel insurance. The embassy website usually gives you advice on how to seek medical help where you are. Your hotel concierge usually is your first port of call.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The big "branded" hotels may even have an in-house visiting doctor. A local pharmacist is always a good shout for minor ailments and they will be able to signpost you to a doctor nearby. Failing all of this and if you are feeling very unwell, the big hospitals should all have an emergency department you can attend.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><br /></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Having an upset stomach is upsetting at any time, it is particularly annoying when on holiday.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">If you thought that when you crossed the North Atlantic on an airliner that you were, reassuringly, a blip on a radar screen somewhere, then we’ve got news for you – you’re not.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Radar stations in the UK and North America have ranges of roughly 250 miles, so for a great deal of the journey, no one can see your aircraft.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So just how are the thousands of planes that make this voyage daily marshalled safely? It’s a system known as the North Atlantic Tracks – like motorway lanes at 38,000ft and it relies on pilots updating controllers with their position.<strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Scroll down for video </strong></p><img id="i-d2496106050eceda" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/14/4C9E78B500000578-5771567-Planes_flying_across_the_Atlantic_follow_high_altitude_lanes_kno-m-49_1527253646269.jpg" height="366" width="634" alt="Nats amazing: Planes flying across the Atlantic follow high altitude lanes, know as the North Atlantic Tracks (pictured).

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But for four or five hours every single one of these planes is off-radar as they cross two vast tracts of oceanic airspace – Shanwick Oceanic Control Area, which is 700,000 square miles, and Gander OCA. The former is mainly controlled by the Nats station in Prestwick, Scotland, and the latter by Nav Canada.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The reason that there’s no radar coverage for these areas is simple – there just isn’t any land on which to build radar stations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nats stressed to MailOnline Travel, however, that the planes are most certainly being monitored all the same, but this is done by position reports made every few minutes by on-board aircraft computers sending data communications and crew members using high-frequency radio. On the Shanwick side these radio communications are mainly handled in Shannon by the Irish Aviation Authority, with Prestwick handling the data links.</p><img id="i-c57d9c8c205bae70" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/14/4C9E78AC00000578-0-Around_700_000_square_miles_of_airspace_over_the_Atlantic_is_con-a-29_1527253386758.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Around 700,000 square miles of airspace over the Atlantic is controlled by the Nats station in Prestwick, Scotland (pictured)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">To make sure that the planes are safely separated, as well as using these reports, all the flights are organised into strict, pre-determined tracks – the aforementioned <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://nats.aero/blog/2014/06/north-atlantic-skies-gateway-europe/">North Atlantic Tracks</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nats told MailOnline Travel that there are normally five going east and five going west – but that it can be up to 14.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They change each day to try and take advantage of the Jet Stream, which predominantly flows west to east at up to 150mph at between 30,000 feet and 40,000 feet, according to Nats.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Because of the lack of radar coverage aircraft have to be kept much further apart than when they’re over land.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nats said: ‘In radar airspace there is either a five nautical mile or three nautical mile minimum separation laterally between aircraft, however, over the North Atlantic it is 60nm laterally and for aircraft following on the same route it is based on time – essentially 10 minutes apart. For aircraft crossing another aircraft at the same level it is increased further to 15 minutes.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And aircraft are given fixed speeds to make sure they don’t catch up with the plane in front.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The tracks are set up after requests for preferred routeings are received from airlines.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nats positions them according to winds, costs and airspace restrictions and labels them from ‘alpha’ upwards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Carriers must then follow the track structure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, a revolution is about to take place that will mark one of the biggest transformations in transatlantic flight in decades.</p><img id="i-e83daa09fe40678c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/14/4C9E78BC00000578-0-Nats_told_MailOnline_Travel_that_there_are_normally_five_tracks_-a-33_1527253524864.jpg" height="365" width="634" alt="Nats told MailOnline Travel that there are normally five tracks going east and five going west – but that it can be up to 14" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nats announced last week that it has invested in a US company called Aireon, which will use a network of 66 satellites to provide real-time global air traffic surveillance for the first time ever, including over the oceans, deserts and mountain ranges.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Five satellites for this system – known as <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nats.aero/static/the-race-to-space/">Space Based ADS-B</a> - went up with this week’s SpaceX launch and the last of the satellite constellation is set to launch in late 2018.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With annual transatlantic flight numbers expected to hit 800,000 by 2030, this system is very much needed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nats said: 'Using this data provides instantaneous updates on flight progress and in doing so, can deliver a quantum leap in capacity and service performance, making flying safer, cheaper, greener and more predictable. Not only does it allow for an increase in capacity, it allows shorter notice changes to flight planning, the use of more efficient routes, flight levels and variable speeds, all of which translates into fuel and emissions savings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Around 80 per cent of traffic will be able to fly without speed restriction, compared with the fixed speed environment operated today.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">A holiday may well be just the ticket if you have or recently had a health problem. But if we’re talking about something serious, such as cancer or a heart complication, then the cost of travel insurance can be astronomical, and some insurers will refuse to provide cover.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The big issue is ‘pre-existing medical conditions’. Insurers define these as pretty much any illness or disease you currently have, or have had in the past, requiring medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While that may seem very wide ranging, and more minor conditions – perhaps mild and well-controlled asthma – may not result in being quoted higher premiums, you should still declare them. Insurers can, and do, use undeclared conditions as reasons to turn down medical claims. For anyone with a pre-existing medical condition, to get the right cover at the best price, here are the key pointers.</p><img id="i-8434f952d447a6f7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/16/4C5168ED00000578-5709491-image-a-73_1526571561952.jpg" height="498" width="634" alt="Move quickly: Taking out cover long after you've booked your trip can be an expensive mistake" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Choose your destination</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have a significant medical condition, before you book your trip find out how much the travel insurance will set you back. Even for a short visit, the cost of getting covered can run to hundreds of pounds in countries where the medical care is private and expensive, notably the USA, and where there are potentially hefty emergency travel and repatriation costs, such as the Caribbean.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Generally, cover is much cheaper in Europe. However, premiums can be dearer for trips to Spain, Malta and Cyprus, which have higher levels of privatised health care than some other European countries.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Use the EHIC</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One advantage of holidaying in Europe is the European Health Insurance Card (ehic.org.uk). Though not a substitute for travel insurance, it entitles UK residents to free or reduced-cost state healthcare when in another EU country – and Iceland, Norway and Switzerland – including pre-existing medical conditions, as long as you’re not travelling intending to obtain treatment. Let’s hope EHIC arrangements will continue after Brexit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Consider a single-trip policy</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you go abroad several times a year, normally annual, multi-trip policies are the best value. However, for those with serious pre-existing medical conditions, annual cover can be prohibitively expensive, and single-trip policies may cost less.

Any condition (other than a terminal prognosis of under six months) is covered and, unusually, the policy requires no medical screening – though your doctor needs to be happy for you to travel. However, this is not a full travel insurance policy: it provides up to £500,000 for emergency medical treatment and repatriation, but doesn’t cover cancellation costs or baggage.</p><img id="i-4aacef495d27ff50" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/16/4C5D07C900000578-5709491-image-a-75_1526572013133.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="For those with a medical condition, sorting out insurance straight after the trip is set up is a no-brainer" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Book then take out cover</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cancellation cover is a key element of most travel insurance policies – it accounts for about a third of claims.

Monkeys howled among brightly coloured plants and unfamiliar exotic birds screeched from the treetops. I stumbled over tangles of tree roots while trying not to step on thousands of tiny black frogs, scurrying around in the undergrowth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My brilliant hike through the wilderness of Mauritius seemed a million miles from the pristine comfort and stylish restaurants of the five-star resort where I was staying.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This tropical holiday island is famous for luxury beach hotels lining its coastline of white sand, coral reefs and turquoise lagoons. Along with the year-round warmth they have helped make Mauritius a favourite of honeymooning couples and once-in-a-lifetime holidaymakers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was lucky to be staying at Le Touessrok – a fabulous resort on the east coast – but was determined not to spend my stay slumped on a sunlounger. I’d travelled 6,000 miles to get there and wanted to find out more about this island in the Indian Ocean, 700 miles east of Madagascar.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I soon discovered that Mauritius is about the size of West Yorkshire and five times bigger than the Isle of Wight. It’s an independent country with a culture that’s a mix of Asian, African and Western. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its claim to fame is that it was once the home of the dodo, a bird that was so easy to catch and delicious to eat that it became extinct in 1662.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A few days of torrential rain made it easier to abandon the beaches of Le Touessrok. With a borrowed umbrella I visited the island’s biggest market at the nearby town of Flacq.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was fun browsing a vast array of colourful stalls selling chillies, plantains and tea. The atmosphere was boisterous but friendly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Away from the resorts, visitors find Mauritius is safe and easy to explore. The locals are welcoming and even in the densest jungles, there aren’t any deadly spiders, snakes or mammals.</p><img id="i-a5da178aae64fddb" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/15/4C5168D500000578-5709453-image-a-44_1526566384791.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Le Pouce, a jaw-dropping column of rock on the island of Mauritius. Le Pouce means ‘The Thumb’ in French" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I visited popular inland sights, such as the Chamarel Waterfalls, where the St Denis River plunges 272ft from a cliff into the rainforest below. Because of the heavy rain the falls were more spectacular than usual, filling the forest with misty spray. Black fruit bats, with their 3ft wing span, swooped ominously across the treetops.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The wild, jagged landscape is a reminder that Mauritius is a volcanic island that erupted out of the sea millions of years ago. I visited Seven Coloured Earth Park, a strange barren area of multicoloured rock in the middle of thick jungle, a relic of original lava formations. Today all Mauritius’s volcanoes are inactive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As the rain continued, I felt sorry for those who had opted to stay at the beach. The monsoon drumming on the wooden roof of La Varangue sur Morne restaurant added to the adventurous atmosphere. The restaurant terrace hangs above a spectacular view and I felt like an intrepid explorer looking out through the tropical downpour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That dramatic view inspired me to try some serious hiking. I heard there was a network of good paths leading to the vertical pinnacles of volcanic rock rising from the rainforest.</p><img id="i-c10f1651dba690c4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/15/4C5168DF00000578-5709453-image-a-45_1526566390547.jpg" height="497" width="634" alt="Mauritius is a volcanic island that erupted out of the sea millions of years ago. Pictured is some of the multi-coloured volcanic rock " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rain stopped and in temperatures of around 30C I soon dried off. I arranged a local guide to help me tackle a couple of the best mountains. How hard could they be? After all, even the tallest is 500ft shorter than England’s highest, Scafell Pike.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I should’ve realised that it wasn’t going to be quite that easy when my guide turned up. He was a 6ft 6in muscleman seconded from an army special unit for the day. I was instructed to call him by his nickname: ‘Zinc’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He led me on a nine-mile trek to reach a sudden cliff. This was Piton de la Petite Riviere Noire, the island’s highest peak. We scrambled to the summit using ropes. Amazingly, at the top I found a painted park bench looking out over the wooded gorges below. Zinc explained this is a popular day trip for locals who have picnics up here as if they were having a stroll in the park.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If that wasn’t impressive enough, Zinc then took me up Le Pouce, another vertical column of rock, slightly shorter than Le Piton. Le Pouce means ‘The Thumb’ in French, which gives you an idea of the shape of this mountain.</p><img id="i-c1e8828afcd59db7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/15/4C51687C00000578-5709453-image-a-43_1526566379412.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Time to relax: The enticing beachfront luxury of Le Touessrok Resort" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Zinc explained it is one of the most popular hikes on the island. The first man to climb Le Pouce was a young Charles Darwin in 1836.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It hasn’t got any easier in the intervening 182 years. I found it was another tricky scramble to get to the tiny summit. There was just enough room for a selfie of Zinc and me.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Burma has been at the top of my travel wish-list for years. I’ve made more than 100 programmes for the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/bbc/index.html" id="mol-b8df3460-55d9-11e8-8fd0-f7391b7148e4">BBC</a>, visiting at least 120 countries in the process, but I was beginning to fear that getting to Burma might never happen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then, last summer an opportunity arose to finally visit the country and make a two-part documentary. But no sooner had we planned our four-week trip than the Rohingya crisis erupted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an appalling exodus, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya people started to flee their homes in the northern Rakhine province following an offensive by Burma’s military, and sought refuge in neighbouring Bangladesh.</p><img id="i-cf8ee0576f2e88bb" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/14/08/4C35FCA300000578-5721091-image-a-8_1526284708217.jpg" height="642" width="962" alt="TV presenter Simon Reeve says he always thougth that Burma was an exotic, slightly mysterious country, and it is a place with which Britain has a long connection and history. Pictured are hot air balloons flying over the ancient pagodas of Bagan " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The United Nations described the offensive as a ‘textbook example of ethnic cleansing’. In response, Burma’s military said it was fighting Rohingya militants and denied targeting civilians.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So should we cancel our trip? No. Believing that it was more important than ever to report what was actually happening in the country, we decided to press ahead with our plans.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’d always felt that Burma was an exotic, slightly mysterious country, and it is a place with which Britain has a long connection and history. Britain was once the colonial ruler in much of Burma, and some of the things we did are connected with the current crisis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Burma is also a country that really matters. It has huge natural resources but it has been largely cut off from the outside world for a long time.</p><img id="i-a9b94bfda234c994" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/14/08/4C20F74D00000578-5721091-Ancient_wonders_Bagan_is_home_to_2_000_Buddhist_temples_and_was_-a-6_1526284555050.jpg" height="642" width="962" alt="Ancient wonders: Bagan is home to 2,000 Buddhist temples and was a highlight for Simon on his trip to Burma" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Things had started to change but it’s now very unclear which direction the country will take next.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We started our trip in the south, in the former colonial capital of Mawlamyine. It’s a beautiful city, with lots of dilapidated old buildings, but that was really just the beginning of the adventure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From there I hopped on a train on the Burmese Railway, which was quite a treat. It was not luxurious by any means – we sat on hard benches rather than sumptuous seats – but it was really memorable as a result.

'The revenues of the tax are primarily invested in environmental protection projects in order to substantially reduce these impacts and preserve our territory.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The doubling of the tourist tax from May 1st will mean guests staying in hotels, city hotels, five-star apartment hotels, five-star luxury and four-star superiors will pay four euros per day; those of four stars and three stars superior, three euros; those of one, two and three stars, two euros.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for tourist apartments, holidaymakers staying in four keys and four upper keys will pay four euros per day; three keys upper, three euros; one, two and three keys, two euros.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In rural hotels, it will be two euros per day; in hostels, hostels residences, pensions, inns, tourist camps and campsites, as well as shelters, it will be two euros.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The tax decreases by 50 per cent on the ninth night of a holidaymaker's stay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the first time, the Government will also charge cruise ship passengers if they stop at a port in the Balearic Islands regardless of the berth time - up to now it was only charged after 12 hours. The fee will be two euros and this alone is estimated to generate revenue of about 1.8 million euros.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Balearic Government says the tax will still be 'the lowest in Europe' compared to Brussels (average cost of eight euros), Florence (five euros) and Amsterdam (three euros). </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>This summer will also be the first time cruise ship passengers will be subject to the charge as part of the Balearic's bid to bring in millions of euros of extra income.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ted Thornhill</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-05-02T01:52:22.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Tourist tax in Majorca and Ibiza DOUBLES from today</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-05-02T01:52:22.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5677473/Meet-Emirates-flight-attendant-setting-Instagram-alight.html" title="Meet the stunning Emirates flight attendant who is setting Instagram alight with mesmerising photographs of her globe-trotting lifestyle "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5677765/Timelapse-footage-shows-British-Airways-A380-flying-Heathrow-San-Francisco-FOUR-MINUTES.html" title="Stunning timelapse footage shows a pilot's-eye-view of a British Airways A380 flight from Heathrow to San Francisco that takes just FOUR MINUTES"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5674339/Hilarious-picture-captures-seal-appears-brutal-hangover.html" title="Flippin' 'eck my head hurts!

Showing few signs of improvement, the firm received a 42 per cent customer score overall. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Both InterRent and Goldcar were the only providers to receive just two stars for customer service. And the two operators also share the dubious honour of being part of Europcar – which has faced allegations of overcharging for repairs, and is the worst-performing of the big brands in the survey.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Auto Reisen scored the highest rating for the fifth year in a row, with a 96 per cent customer score. The company scored five out of five stars in almost every category, including value for money, charging an average of only £16 a day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The firm, which only operates in the Canary Islands, scored its lowest rating of four stars for the age and condition of its cars but more than made up for this with excellent customer service, all-inclusive prices, no excess and no unexpected charges.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Enterprise was the highest rated worldwide firm with an overall 78 per cent customer score. Customers described the provider as 'friendly' and 'flawless' for customer service, awarding it five out of five stars in that category - the only major company to score so highly this year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clarity over the final hire cost also earned the company a top score, with one customer telling Which? that Enterprise 'never tries to sell me any extras I don't need or want'.</p><img id="i-e1164e5580feb5e4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/15/4B9E38CC00000578-5665255-image-a-39_1524840254697.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Both InterRent and Goldcar are the only providers to receive just two stars for customer service" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rory Boland, Which?

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The Colosseum, Pantheon, Forum, Vatican City – there’s so much to see in the Italian capital, and that’s before we get on to great food and tempting shops. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No wonder Rome is a must-do mini-break.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You’re not going to get around all the sightseeing riches the Eternal City has to offer in two days without exhausting yourself, but you can cover the magnificent highlights, and keep control of the budget, too, by staying at a posh new hostel…</p><img id="i-f9c98102a2823118" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/14/16/4B2478E800000578-0-image-a-3_1523718122226.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="Roman treasures: The Vatican looks simply stunning when it's lit up at night " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>DAY ONE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Morning</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Head to the Vatican City first. You don’t want to spend your whole day waiting in line so buy a skip-the-queue ticket – Attraction Tickets Direct’s three-day Omnia Vatican and Rome Pass (£99 adults, £71 children) includes hop-on/hop-off bus ticket, free Rome travelcard, fast-track entry to the Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel, and free audio guide for St Peter’s Basilica.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is also free entry to two other attractions from six choices: Colosseum; Roman Forum and Palatine Hill; Capitolini Museums; Borghese Gallery; Museum of Rome and National Museum of Castel Sant’Angelo.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And you also get discounts on 30 other attractions and a guidebook (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://attraction-tickets-direct.co.uk/">attraction-tickets-direct.co.uk</a>, 0800 077 3723).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For lunch, there’s La Soffitta Renovatio in Piazza del Risorgimento (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://lasoffittarenovatio.com/">lasoffittarenovatio.com</a>) for the best hamburger e patatine fritte – aka burger and chips – I have ever tasted.</p><img id="i-f1e47eefba58f3e2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/14/16/4B247B6D00000578-5615873-image-a-6_1523719557791.jpg" height="452" width="634" alt="Top attraction: The Trevi Fountain (above) is free to enjoy but can be crowded" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Afternoon</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Walk off some of those calories looking around the grand Colosseum, the largest amphitheatre ever built and not in bad nick considering, and the ruins of the Roman Forum next door.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can walk to your hostel from the Colosseum. Generator Rome may offer minimal service (no luggage porter) and facilities (no telly) but they claim the lead-in price for a double room for two is just €40 (£35) per person per night.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Needless to say, prices fluctuate throughout the year and you will pay more around special events – and be aware that the city tax is not included in these prices (€3.50pp per night), and has to be paid direct at the hostel. Visit <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://generatorhostels.com/">generatorhostels.com</a> for more details.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A casual, unfussy but tasty dinner is available – margherita pizza for €7 (about £6.10), for example, plus there are often special offers on food and drink.</p><img id="i-b0bafbd9828629ea" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/14/16/4B2478C000000578-0-image-a-5_1523718139456.jpg" height="417" width="634" alt="Grand: Walk off some of those calories looking around the Colosseum (above), the largest amphitheatre ever built" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>DAY TWO</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Morning</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Breakfast at Generator Rome is a bargain – just €5 (£4.40) for an all-you-can-eat feast featuring cereals, fruits, boiled eggs, ham, cheese, breads, jams, cake and drinks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Next, head out on a Scooteroma (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://scooteroma.com/">scooteroma.com</a>) tour by Vespa – it’s fun, if slightly terrifying! Guests ride as a passenger behind an expert driver. A classic four-hour tour costs from €200pp (£175), so it’s not cheap, but it zips you around lesser-known sights that would otherwise be a faff to reach. Itineraries can be tailor-made. For example, a street art tour of the Ostiense district takes in Kid Acne’s Paint Over The Cracks and JB Rock’s Wall Of Fame, and includes a coffee or gelato.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eat lunch on the run – look out for ‘pizza al metro’ shops for pieces of pizza with a vast choice of toppings, then pretend you are rich and window-shop outside the designer boutiques at Via Condotti and the Spanish Steps.</p><img id="i-db70ef02f054b8cb" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/14/16/4B2478BC00000578-0-image-a-4_1523718136065.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="'Eat lunch on the run – look out for &quot;pizza al metro&quot; shops for pieces of pizza with a vast choice of toppings,' writes Wendy Gomersall" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Afternoon</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I adore the Trevi fountain, which is free to enjoy but can be crowded – go in the early evening when many people head back to their hotels for dinner. For unabashed luxury, stay at the Hotel Eden (dorchester collection.com), just a coin’s-throw away. If it’s a bunfight close to the water, head for the steps of the Santi Vincenzo e Anastasio church opposite, from where you get a good view. Go inside this church, too – it offers free concerts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To cool off in summer, pay €3 (£2.60) to visit the Citta Dell’Acqua (City of Water) – underground ruins a minute’s walk from the fountain. My tip: don’t pay for a guide as displays are in English.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For a casual dinner, head for the brilliant Mercato Centrale Roma (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://mercatocentrale.it/">mercatocentrale.it</a>) for great, reasonably priced food – tasty pizza, pasta, veggie burgers and awesome cannoli, all served from a big selection of artisan stalls.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it’s just a five-minute walk from Generator and an aperitivo on the roof terrace.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ciao Roma!</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-a7a3f370-3ff4-11e8-b465-8f7fa04d3131">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TRAVEL FACTS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">There are direct flights to Rome from all over the UK. Flights to from Edinburgh with Ryanair (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://ryanair.com/">ryanair.com</a>) cost from £36.71pp one-way; from Heathrow or Gatwick with British Airways (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://ba.com/">ba.com</a>) they cost from £110pp return. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Take a bus rather than an expensive taxi to Roma Termini in the city centre, as it’s only a five-minute walk from Generator Rome.

The £226.9million Statue of Unity in western India will be 597 feet tall when it's finished in October - that's almost twice the height of the Statue of Liberty and nearly 100 feet higher than the current record holder, China's Spring Temple Buddha. It's being built on  Sadhu Island  in the state of Gujarat, with the waters of the Narmada river surrounding it. Images reveal that the foundations have been laid for the structure along with central support pillars but there is still a bit of work to do before it takes on the form of the late political and social leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, whom it will honour.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ted Thornhill</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-22T16:54:55.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Photos reveal progress being made on the world's tallest statue</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-22T16:54:55.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5526841/The-quietest-roads-America-revealed.html" title="The roads less traveled: America's top ten most beautiful and least-driven routes mapped out by state "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5531457/Singapores-Changi-named-worlds-best-airport-ninth-time.html" title="The world's best airports revealed: Singapore's Changi is No1 for the sixth year in a row (with Heathrow T2 named as the top terminal)"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5518461/Meet-woman-runs-one-Africas-exclusive-conservancies.html" title="'It's like living on an island': Meet the woman who runs one of Africa's most exclusive conservancies, living remotely on 19,000 acres surrounded by rhino, lions and giraffes "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5527849/Interactive-map-reveals-200-vineyards-visit-ENGLAND.html" title="Fascinating interactive map reveals the 200 vineyards you can visit¿ in ENGLAND and WALES (and you can stay the night at 47 of them)"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5523657/The-164ft-superyacht-SILENT-mode.html" title="The 164ft superyacht with a SILENT mode: Hearing expert helped develop the hybrid-powered boat to ensure engine noise never goes above 'softly falling rain'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5526749/Passengers-taken-planes-Gatwick-driverless-BUSES.html" title="Passengers may be taken to their planes at Gatwick Airport on driverless BUSES if 'autonomous vehicle' trial this summer is successful"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5527257/POV-footage-shows-Blackpools-Icon-coaster-action-time.html" title="Thrilling point-of-view footage shows Blackpool's £16m 'Icon' roller coaster in action for the first time with newly unveiled copper-gold carriages zooming around the track at 50mph "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5519183/The-stunning-cave-pool-suites-Kayakapi-Premium-Caves.html" title="Inside the stunning cave pool suites at the hotel TripAdvisor users say is the best in Turkey"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.statueofunity.in/#the_project" title="www.statueofunit..."></link></item><item><title>Nights by the sea: Discover the five best beach bars in Lisbon perfect for sipping on sundowners whilst you watch the sun set</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/destinations/article-5439643/best-beach-bars-lisbon.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2018 11:05:08 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5439643</guid><description><![CDATA[When visiting Lisbon  make sure you enjoy a sundowner, Mediterranean nibbles or a dance at one of these beach bars that are just a short distance from the centre of the Portuguese capital.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

From the contemporary yet cosy décor that features bright pops of colour to the resident DJ that is there most weekends, it’s a high-end venue for night time antics. Spend the day there and relax on one of the sought-after cabanas before enjoying an evening of white wine sangria, unbeatable sunset views and music under the stars. The bar is open Monday–Thursday 1200–1900, Friday–Sunday 1200–2000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Getting there: From Lisbon’s centre, drive north over the 25th April Bridge before taking the A38 towards Costa da Caparica.

While mainly a restaurant, its beautiful terrace is a great little spot for a drink and to soak up some stunning views of the Portuguese coastline. It’s retained some of its traditional charm in its menu and ambiance, and there’s often live piano performances to enjoy plus a range of G+T options at the bar. The bar is open Wednesday–Monday 1100–2300.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Getting there: A Pastorinha is a half hour drive from the city centre if you take the A5 westbound and take the 8th exit onto the N6-7. It’s also possible to reach it by train from the city centre if you head west on the Linha de Cascais to Carcavelos. It’s then a 15-minute walk south along Avenida Jorge before you hit the beach, and another 10-minute stroll east to A Pastorinha.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2F9JBpb">Delmare Café</a></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you want to experience one of Lisbon’s legendary sunset summer parties, put <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2F9JBpb">Delmare Café</a> on your evening agenda. Another Costa de Caparica haunt, it turns into a party place after dark that strives to mirror the cool all-night bars of Ibiza. Spread over multiple areas, cosy seating areas on the sand are ideal for lounging around with friends while the DJ area is ideal if you’re feeling energetic. In the high season, it often stays open until 1600 making it an all-night destination. The bar is open Sunday–Thursday 0900–0200, Friday–Saturday 0900–0400.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Getting there: Cross over the 25th April Bridge out of the centre.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Just a pair of Mickey Mouse ears can set you back the best part of 20 euros at Disneyland Paris. But you can rein in the spending a little with your accommodation.

Surrounded by well-tended golf courses, the hotel is a haven from the tourist crowds, which you can leave behind when you depart Disneyland Paris. Accommodation is apartment-style, so you get a kitchenette and a little living area as part of the package. In addition to the nine- and 18-hole golf courses, you can enjoy the swimming pool and tennis court.

Its paid-for shuttle service makes it easy to get to the park. But, for the days you don’t go, you can give the kids a great holiday in its two pools and busy entertainment programme. Think finger painting for children to crepe making for older ones. Spacious rooms have well-equipped kitchens if you fancy the self-catering route.

It’s a no-fuss hotel with bright splashes of colour added by feature walls in the rooms. A free breakfast of continental staples is served between 0700–1100, and in the evenings, a snack bar turns out pizzas, pastas and salads.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Sun, sea and sangria are a winning combination and undoubtedly part of Barcelona’s appeal. If you’ve exhausted yourself on Las Ramblas and know the Gothic Quarter inside-out, head down to the beach and put your feet up – or dance them off – with a drink in hand. With that in mind, here are some of the best beach bars in the city.</p><img id="i-e6c29365c4e26920" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/20/11/4966C7E300000578-5412379-image-a-1_1519127568754.jpg" height="424" width="634" alt="If you've exhausted every haunt in the city centre, there are plenty of seaside establishments to settle down with a beverage" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2Ca6fgr">El Boo</a></strong><strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Located away from the city crowds, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2Ca6fgr">Boo</a> perches on the pier of Nova Mar Bella Beach. In other words, it’s the perfect spot to watch the tide change and the sun sink into the sea. Upstairs is a restaurant serving sea urchins, prawns and freshly-caught fish on the grill. The dress code here is slightly smarter than the downstairs beach bar. But the views, music and drinks are equally fantastic in both.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Beach: Nova Mar Bella </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong><strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2BFdifR">La Guingueta de la Barceloneta</a></strong></strong></strong><strong> </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Based on the chiringuitos, or seasonal Spanish beach bars prevalent throughout the country, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2BFdifR">La Guingueta</a> offers a relaxed approach to beach-side drinking and dining. This is a bar in its purest sense, with a serving hatch facing the beach and a collection of parasols and seats outside. The menu is seasonal and always exciting, and the drinks are refreshingly modestly priced. The emphasis is on fresh fruit, and combining them with spirits in new and interesting ways, making this among the most innovative, natural and – maybe – healthy bars in the city. Well, the sun is good for you at least, right?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Beach: Sant Sebastià </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Carpe Diem Lounge Club</strong></strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A carnival atmosphere presides at Carpe Diem Lounge Club on Marina Beach, with a variety of wild fancy-dress parties and performances every weekend. If you’re after a colourful night out, this is the spot for you. If you want a quieter drink in the day, CDLC also has something in store for you with a varied food and drinks menu. Champagne is encouraged as the drink of choice, with Dom Perignon served in tin cups (of course) but a simple beer won’t cost the earth, either. The ideal place to wind down of an afternoon, or wind up for a big evening.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Beach: Marina Beach </strong></p><img id="i-d9d2410856a396aa" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/20/11/4966C8A000000578-5412379-image-a-2_1519127580805.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Places like OneOcean Bar and Cafe Del Mar Club offer delicious signature cocktails to sip by the beach" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Cafe Del Mar Club</strong></strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cafe Del Mar is quickly becoming one of Barcelona’s most beloved beach bars. The crowd is mostly young, taking advantage of the live DJs performing throughout the day during peak season. There’s a swimming pool and loungers, if the sea is a bit too nippy (or far away from the bar). In addition to private changing rooms and a signature cocktail menu, special events are held throughout the year in its 500-person, fourth-floor sky bar. Oh, it also has its own yacht from which you can watch the sunset, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Beach: Port Forum </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>OneOcean Bar</strong></strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ok, not quite on the beach, OneOcean Bar offers relaxed drinks in a prestigious environment. You can sip a cocktail overlooking the luxury yachts in the harbour, or take in the Barcelona skyline at your back. The Gold Sense is a suitably named cocktail, mixing whisky with orange, mango and grenadine. Meanwhile, the Harbour Appeal combines gin with a hint of ginger and apple to help cleanse the palate after a long day of sampling Barcelona’s best dishes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Beach: OneOcean Port Vell </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>The Coconut Club</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Inspired by the Caribbean, this relaxed venue draws in tourists and locals in equal measure. Nachos and grilled sandwiches are menu highlights, while its drinks are served from midday and are typically heavy on pineapple and, of course, coconut. Surfers often make up much of the clientele during the day, and at night the vibe is more pub than club, making this a laid-back and unpretentious place to unwind with great food from braised duck breast to Jamaican rum balls for afters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Beach: Somorrostro </strong></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Vai Moana</strong></strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Often considered to be the local’s beach, Bogatell is known to be quieter and more family-friendly than the busier tourist-heavy spots located elsewhere. Modelled in the tradition of the chiringuito and located right on the beachfront, Vai Moana does quality, freshly prepared food and drink, including paella and speciality burgers. Sun-loungers, VIP hammocks and televisions for sports events make it the ideal place to while away the day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Beach: Bogatell </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Chiringuito BeGay</strong></strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This LGBT-friendly bar on Mar Bella Beach comes with a free and easy atmosphere. The crowd is a mixture of locals and travellers, and the vibe, relaxed and casual. Its frequent parties are said to be among the city’s liveliest, but it’s also known for a great breakfast of pastries and fresh smoothies. And, if you need to recover from the night before, you can even opt for a freshly-prepared protein shake to help you rebuild your beach body.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Beach: Mar Bella </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Sun, sea and sangria are a winning combination and undoubtedly part of Barcelona’s appeal.

It remains popular with locals and visitors alike, and is a great place to try classics like Bratwurst, Boulette (a kind of meatball) and, of course, currywurst, which comes in the classic pork but also vegan varieties. <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2CXR4Ud">Konnopke’s</a> is open Monday to Friday 1000–2000, and on Saturdays 1130–2000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>U-Bahn: Eberswalder Straße</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Mustafa’s</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kebabs may be on offer all over the city, but not all kebabs are created equal. Arguably the best in Berlin are the chicken kebabs from Mustafa’s in Kreuzberg, where it is not uncommon to see a long queue at any time of the day or night. The imbiss, located on Mehringdamm, is open Sunday to Thursday 1000-0200, and Friday and Saturday 1000–0500.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>U-Bahn: Mehringdamm</strong></p><div>

In keeping with its informed but down-to-earth character, the wine is of a high quality but reasonably priced. It’s no surprise then that this has become something of an insider tip in the city. Open Sunday and Tuesday to Thursday 1705–2300, and Friday and Saturday 1705–2400.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>U-Bahn: Nauener Platz</strong></p><img id="i-90ea0c3e72b0124c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/13/11/492A07AD00000578-5308397-image-a-7_1518520603925.jpg" height="634" width="634" alt="Line up for the perfect pizza at Stranero" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2Dy18U6">Dolores California Burritos</a></strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For more than 10 years, the good folks at Dolores have been serving their excellent California burritos on Rosa-Luxemburg-Straße. As their popularity has grown their menu of Cali-Mex cuisine has expanded to include quesadillas, soft tacos, salads and soups. As well as the original <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2Dy18U6">Dolores</a> in Berlin-Mitte, there is another branch on Wittenbergplatz in Berlin-Schöneberg.

The eatery has been successfully frying its signature dish since 1908, and its secret recipe, served with potato salad and coleslaw, is as popular today as it ever was. <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2Dy28HQ">Henne</a> is located in an atmospheric old Berlin tavern, but, in the warmer months, you can enjoy your chicken and cold beers in the leafy beer garden.

Made with Scottish Angus beef and served on a seedless bun, those who have tried <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2DLFGyw">Tommi’s burgers</a> can testify that this man is a master of the art.

This may be fast food but the quality of the meat is high, as is the sauce (made to a secret recipe). This perfect mix is good enough to keep you coming back for more. <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2D4fPkJ">Curry 36</a> is open Thursday to Tuesday 0900–0500, and Wednesday 0900–0200.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>U-Bahn: Mehringdamm</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2DKOEf8">Rogacki</a></strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A West Berlin institution, Rogacki has been serving food for Berliners to eat in or takeaway since the 1930s.

Don’t miss the eel and other fish smoked in-house.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Although renowned for its vast network of canals, Venice is actually a coastal city on the shores of the Adriatic Sea. There are several popular beach resorts within easy reach of the city. Many of the beaches on <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/italy/index.html" id="mol-833ac120-0a99-11e8-8cd5-0b24b25ae088">Italy</a>’s Adriatic Coast are separated into private areas owned or rented by hotels. Most are open to day visitors where for a few euros you can use their loungers, parasols and shower facilities. You’ll also find free-to-use public beach areas in most resorts. Check out our top five favourite beaches within two hours of Venice.</p><img id="i-18be978f208001fc" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/05/15/48E6197400000578-5352621-image-a-26_1517842832275.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Escape the city for a trip to the infamous Lido Beach of Venice in italy" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Great for sunbathing</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Lido di Venezia</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A sliver of a sandbar between the lagoon and the Adriatic Sea, Lido di Venezia is the closest beach suburb to central Venice. It was developed as a holiday beach resort in the early 20th century (the name lido came from here), and in recent years has become famous as the home of the Venice Film Festival each September. While its soft, buttery sands aren’t the finest along the coast, the ornate Italian art nouveau architecture, and the sweeping views of the lagoon and the Dolomites mountains beyond, the Lido di Venezia has a charm of its own. There are several hotels dotted along the waterfront, and plenty of bars, restaurants and beach shops to sate the summer crowds. If you’re looking to free yourself of the crowds (and clothes) head to the southern flanks of the island and Alberoni, Venice’s popular naturist beach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Travel from Venice:</strong> It’s just a 20-minute vaporetto (water bus) ride from St. Mark’s Square.</p><img id="i-c2d846545bc99c77" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/05/15/48E6198400000578-5352621-image-a-27_1517842837389.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Postcard perfect:  Lido di Jesolo is simply beautiful " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ideal for families</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Lido di Jesolo</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Less than an hour’s drive from Venice, Lido di Jesolo is one of the Adriatic Coast’s most popular beach resorts for families. Dotted along its 10-mile stretch of wide, clean sands are a wealth of family attractions and family friendly hotels and campsites. Come face-to-face with sharks at the Sea Life Aquarium, score a hole-in-one at one of the many minigolf courses, or ride the dizzyingly high water slides at Aqualandia, the region's biggest water park. The beach itself is lined with hotels, beach bars and restaurants, while there are scores of buzzy cafés, locally run restaurants and ice cream parlours all catering to the summer crowd in the streets behind the beach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Travel from Venice:</strong> An hour’s drive or an 80-minute journey by public bus.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Best for history lovers</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sottomarina di Chioggia</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Located at the southern end of the Venetian lagoon, Sottomarina is a small buzzy beach resort popular with the local crowd. Like Lido di Venezia, Sottomarina’s beach benefits from a swathe of clean, butter-hued sands lapped by the shallow waters of the Adriatic. Like much of Venice, Sottomarina and the port, Sottomarina di Chioggia, are both situated on islands and connected by a series of small bridges. Chioggia is a historic fishing port, often known as Little Venice, which is crammed with ancient churches, rustic cafés and local bars and trattorias. It also has an esteemed art gallery and a bustling fish market for those who want an alternative to beach lounging.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Travel from Venice:</strong> Around 80 minutes by bus. In the summer, there’s a direct ferry service between Chioggia and Venice.</p><img id="i-1ab87d8f849fceb5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/05/15/48E6195800000578-5352621-image-a-28_1517842857172.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Don't miss the chance to visit Bibione during your visit to Venice " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Try a thermal spa</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Bibione</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perched on the northern fringes of the Veneto Coast, Bibione is a popular beach resort famous for its thermal spas. Spend an afternoon in the Bibione thermal baths, whose 52-degree waters are sourced from a depth of 1,640ft (500m) and are renowned for its health-boosting properties. Boasting five miles of wide, pristine sands and clean, shallow Adriatic waters, Bibione’s beaches are also a popular family destination. There are dozens of hotels, bars and restaurants dotted along the main stretch, many with private beach areas offering sun loungers, parasols and waiter service. The beach has several water sports centres, 28 lifeguard stations and Wi-Fi. It’s also Italy’s first smoke-free beach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Travel from Venice:</strong> An 80-minute drive or bus ride from Venice.</p><img id="i-4ebe5c54f79ddf9b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/05/15/48E6193F00000578-5352621-image-a-29_1517842868500.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="A stunning sunset  at Caorle Beach, which is just an hour away form the city" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Explore the Roman port</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Caorle</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Located 40km north of Venice, Caorle’s vast sweep of buttery sandy beaches and shallow tepid waters attracts a loyal beach crowd each summer. But there's more to this charming seaside resort than building sandcastles. Once a Roman port, Caorle has an historic centre set behind the beach which is awash with colourful painted houses, pavement cafes and rustic trattorias. Check out the quaint Sanctuary of the Madonna dell'Angelo, a beautiful clifftop chapel overlooking the sea, or pick up a souvenir or two in one of the quirky gift shops which dot the pedestrianised Via Rio Terrà.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Travel from Venice: </strong>It's an hour's drive from the centre of Venice, but in during the summer months a tourist boat travels between Caorle and Venice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Although renowned for its vast network of canals, Venice is actually a coastal city on the shores of the Adriatic Sea.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Fancy nipping to Paris for less than the price of a decent bottle of Bordeaux? Then look no further. Plan it right and you could be enjoying cafe crème and buttery croissants under the Eiffel Tower before you can say bonjour. Check our top tips for travelling to the City of Love on a shoestring.</p><img id="i-53e742acc4910510" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/01/15/48CB291A00000578-5339041-image-a-1_1517497665527.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Planning to travel to Paris? We've done all the groundwork for you so you don't have to" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Go compare!</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s no reason to spend extra bucks unnecessarily, often the best deals on travel are found using price comparison engines like <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2mF1u4h">Skyscanner </a>or <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2mHdj9V">travelsupermarket.com</a>. To get the very best prices, try to be as flexible as you can with dates and times of travel. Peak times and weekends are always going to be the most expensive, as are special dates such as Valentine's weekend and Easter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Go by air</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The fastest way to get to the French capital is by plane, with most flights taking around an hour and 45 minutes from London airports. However, this doesn’t factor in travel to and from the airports or getting into Paris from Charles de Gaulle or Orly, both of which can sometimes take an hour and rack up the cost.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the best deals, use a price comparison site which scours hundreds of airlines. We found flights from £27 departing London Gatwick to Paris Charles de Gaulle one way. Be aware that not all airlines are featured on these sites. Low-cost airline Ryanair, for example, are not included. They only fly in and out of Beauvais-Tille, an airport 53 miles north of Paris, so whatever savings you make on the flight will be negated by the cost and time of getting into the city.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Prices from:</strong> £27 each way. Pros: Quick. Cons: You have to factor in transfers from the airport to the city centre.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Or by rail</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2DpDYlS">Eurostar </a>is the second quickest way to the City of Love. It takes two hours and 15 minute from London St Pancras and despatches you right at Gare du Nord. However, Eurostar can be notoriously pricey at short notice. Tickets are released several months in advance, which offer the best deals with fares are as low as £29 each way. However, Eurostar does love a seat sale, so keep your eyes peeled.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Prices from: </strong>£29 each way when booked in advance. Pros: Fast services which arrive in the city centre. Cons: Cheap last-minute tickets are hard to find.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Take the car</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A bit old school, but plenty of folk still use the car and ferry combination to drive to Paris. It takes a lot longer, usually around six or seven hours in total, and you need to factor in the price of fuel and the cross-channel option; either the ferry or the <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2rWk4up">Eurotunnel</a>. It can, however, work out the cheapest way if you're travelling as a family or a group. For the quickest option, the Eurotunnel is a swift and easy way to navigate La Manche. For the best deals book two or three months in advance, but these still come in around £60 each way. The ferry is usually more cost-efficient, but again adds extra time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Prices from:</strong> Eurotunnel and ferry from £60 each way. Pros: Cheaper for families. Cons: Time, and added fuel and parking costs.</p><img id="i-cba240c156a2d55e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/01/15/48CB291E00000578-5339041-image-a-2_1517497678262.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Find the best deal and enjoy an easy journey at a cheap as chips price" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Or go by coach</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Travelling by coach is cheap, easy and relatively comfortable. However, it’s probably the slowest way to travel – services can take up to nine and half hours to get from London to Paris. There are now several options offering good, cheap coach services to Paris. <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2s1ayX3">Eurolines</a>, the European arm of National Express, runs regular departures between the capitals. Book well in advance, at least two months, to get the best deals. We found £12 each way, but watch out for the £5 booking fee on all tickets, which bumps up the price.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">French operator, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2rVMOU9">Ouibus </a>comes in at €15 (£13) each way. They also have reclining seats, free Wi-Fi, plug sockets and USB ports, plus you can take plenty of luggage. However, it’s still nearly 10 hours on a bus. Then you've got <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2nuignP">Flixbus</a>, which offers a similar experience from £12 each way, however, their quickest route is seven hours 30 minutes. It’s also worth noting that overnight services are often more expensive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Prices from:</strong> £12 each way, plus booking fee. Pros: bargain bucket prices. Cons: Lengthy travelling time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Budget tips?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our two main tips for finding the cheapest price to travel to Paris are:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Plan ahead</strong> – most ticket options are usually lowest when booking two to three months ahead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Be flexible</strong> – avoid peak times and weekends as these will always attract higher prices.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Fancy nipping to Paris for less than the price of a decent bottle of Bordeaux?

Whatever your travel needs, there’s an Amsterdam canal cruise for you.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Amsterdam’s canals are arguably the city’s defining feature. Built on former swampland, the picturesque 17th century Canal District is considered a masterpiece of civil engineering, and in 2010 the entire area was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in recognition of its subsequent influence on urban town planning across the globe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Laid out in a series of concentric arcs, the canals are lined with numerous historic and listed buildings, universally recognised as traditional Amsterdam canal houses by their tall narrow form, stepped gable rooflines and symmetry. Many of these old merchants’ houses have been converted into hotels or museums, offering visitors a chance to explore the interiors and imagine what life would have been like in the Dutch Golden Age. The Canal House Museum, Museum Van Loon and Museum Willet-Holthuysen are some prominent examples, as well as the showstopping Pulitzer Amsterdam hotel which occupies 25 interconnecting canal houses along the pretty waterfront of Prinsengracht.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But by far the best way to experience the canals of Amsterdam is by taking one of the city’s many and varied canal cruises and boat tours. Gently drifting along the waterways of Amsterdam is one of the most memorable ways to discover the city, whether you take a one-hour tour of the major highlights or opt for a hop-on, hop-off experience to see the canals at your leisure. Whatever your budget, travel style, and time restrictions, there’s an Amsterdam canal cruise that will suit your needs.</p><img id="i-a5687b3725a2b7ff" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/29/14/48B4B70B00000578-5325163-image-a-1_1517234453087.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="A cruise is one of the most memorable ways to discover the city (Credit: Blue Boat Company)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Simple sightseeing cruises</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The most economical and straightforward of Amsterdam’s canal cruise options is a simple one-hour sightseeing tour which takes in well known highlights like the Magere Brug (skinny bridge), the Anne Frank House and the Westerkerk, as well as rows of Golden Age mansions and warehouses. If you’re pushed for time and you want to get the biggest bang for your buck, the <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2rLPZO9">100 Highlights tour</a> is the cruise to choose. It’s good value, offers frequent departures every 15 minutes (every 30 minutes from 6pm–10pm) and leaves from a central location at Prins Hendrikkade, opposite Centraal Station.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Cruise and dine options</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’re looking for a more leisurely experience, try a dinner cruise against a backdrop of the Canal District’s twinkling lights. This two-and-a-half-hour tour combines sightseeing with an evening meal, and kicks off with a glass of bubbly before your four-course meal. Everything is cooked onboard, and all beer, wine and soft drinks are included. Operated by <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2nl5xnv">Stromma</a>, who also run the 100 Highlights tour above, this is one of the most popular dinner cruise excursions. Alternatives include Amsterdam Jewel Cruises’ three-hour, three-course a la carte dinner cruise onboard a vintage antique riverboat; Lovers Canal Cruises’ two-hour, four-course dinner cruise, which also serves a children’s menu; and Blue Boat’s 90-minute Hard Rock Burger Cruise, which provides a casual takeaway-style burger meal washed down with an ice-cold drink. There’s even a special ‘pancake boat’ (De Pannenkoekenboot) offering various pancake-fuelled alternatives, including a 75-minute family cruise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’ve dined elsewhere, but still want to enjoy an evening cruise, consider a tour where the drinks take precedence.

But it’s worth bearing a few simple points in mind so you don’t encounter any unexpected surprises. Firstly, make sure you know whether your boat is glass enclosed, semi- or fully-open to the elements, and whether or not there is onboard heating, especially if you’re visiting during the colder months of the year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Secondly, find out the location of your departure point and how early you need to arrive. Some tour operators ask you to check in as much as 30 minutes before departure, especially on some of the longer evening cruises.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finally, if you’ve booked a dinner cruise make sure you know exactly what is included in the cost. Some operators will throw in all alcoholic drinks, while others only include soft drinks and offer a paid onboard bar. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>By far the best way to experience the canals of Amsterdam is by taking one of the city’s many and varied canal cruises and boat tours. Gently drifting along the waterways of Amsterdam is one of the most memorable ways to discover the city, whether you take a one-hour tour of the major highlights or opt for a hop-on, hop-off experience to see the canals at your leisure. Whatever your budget, travel style, and time restrictions, there’s an Amsterdam canal cruise that will suit your needs.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Talisa Vandevelde</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-07T12:18:46.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>The best canal cruises and boat tours in Amsterdam</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-07T12:18:46.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/traveldestinations/amsterdam-hotels/article-5317193/best-boutique-hotels-amsterdam.html" title="10 of the best boutique hotels in Amsterdam"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/traveldestinations/amsterdam-hotels/article-5316599/best-bed-breakfast-amsterdam.html" title="The best bed and breakfasts in Amsterdam"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/traveldestinations/amsterdam-hotels/article-5316517/amsterdam-accomodation-advice.html" title="Amsterdam budget accommodation advice"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/traveldestinations/amsterdam-hotels/article-5313197/best-hostels-amsterdam.html" title="Amsterdam on a budget: Top 10 budget hostels in Amsterdam"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/traveldestinations/amsterdam-hotels/article-5316013/best-family-friendly-hotels-amsterdam.html" title="The top 8 family friendly hotels in Amsterdam"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/traveldestinations/amsterdam-hotels/article-5178969/romantic-hotels-amsterdam.html" title="Stays for two: The most romantic hotels in Amsterdam"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://fave.co/2rLPZO9" title="Amsterdam Canal Cruise - 100 Highlights | Stromma.nl"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://fave.co/2nl5xnv" title="Rondvaart Amsterdam?

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">All of this is overlooked by the tallest opera house in the world, Santiago Calatrava's steel and concrete Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia, an ancient Greek helmet-shaped building.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Take a glass of wine on the breeze-cooled palm terrace before the opera or come back on Friday evening when music students from the nearby Berklee College of Music give free concerts on a floating stage in the lake (April to October).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>SACRED PLACES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Valencia cathedral and the Micalet bell tower are must-sees, but be sure to look up when you are inside the cathedral.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The windows are filled with inch-thin alabaster instead of glass. This makes for a spectral interior rendered even more eerie by the presence of Francisco Goya's 1788 painting St Francis Borgia At The Deathbed Of An Impenitent, where a figure of Christ on the crucifix spurts blood on to a sinner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Step into the cathedral's Holy Grail chapel, home to a revered silver chalice which, as it dates to the 1st century AD, might just be the real thing.</p><img id="i-37d1f92082ef9a30" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/12/15/480EC5F100000578-5263351-image-a-2_1515771835009.jpg" height="426" width="634" alt="Making waves: The city also offers easy access to some of Spain's loveliest beaches" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MASTERPIECES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You'll find modern art at the Institut Valencia d'Art Modern (El Ivam) and El Greco paintings at the El Patriarca museum.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>ON THE TILES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The city is famous for its ceramics and tiles, a tradition that dates back to the long years of Moorish rule.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">La Rochelle in France boasts a proud maritime tradition.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is also now a gastronomic hub and an environmental pioneer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here are six attractions you just can't miss... </p><img id="i-538e46d0ed37a41f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/20/15/40909B7A00000578-0-Two_of_the_ancient_towers_at_La_Rochelle_s_imposing_harbour-a-30_1495289611666.jpg" height="405" width="634" alt="Two of the ancient towers at La Rochelle's imposing harbour, just one of the city's marvellous sights " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1. Towers of strength</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A tricolour flutters over the formidable St Nicolas Tower at the old harbour’s entrance. Built in 1345, it used to share defensive duties with the slightly smaller Tower of the Chain. Tour de la Lanterne, the third tower, is the Atlantic coast’s only surviving medieval lighthouse – its walls still bear graffiti from captured English seamen. The image of these monster structures defines La Rochelle as strongly as the Eiffel Tower proclaims Paris. A joint ticket allows entry into all three buildings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. All tied up</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Inspector Maigret creator Georges Simenon lived in the area, and in the 1930s he would ride into town and take refreshment at the Cafe de la Paix. The metal ring to which he tied his horse survives on the wall outside the immaculately restored cafe. Another favourite atmospheric bar is the dimly lit Cave La Guignette.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. Life on the waves</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of La Rochelle’s unofficial names is ‘Daughter of the Sea’. They celebrate many centuries of voyaging, fishing and trading over the world’s oceans in the Maritime Museum, which opened in 2015. The story is told in a series of shell-shaped pavilions. The visit ends on a real vessel, the France 1, the nation’s weather ship. An onboard exhibition celebrates Bernard Moitessier, who was heading for victory in the first non-stop single-handed round-the-world race in 1968-69 but blew the prize by carrying on to Tahiti to ‘save his soul’. The other magnificent marine feature is the Aquarium, where I enjoyed three courses of excellent cooking.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4. Going green</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Is La Rochelle France’s greenest city? In 2015 they tested a driver-less electric bus. Guided by sensors, it jinked around the harbourside, niftily avoiding obstacles and people. France’s first pedestrianised streets were here, along with the original public bicycle hiring scheme. The eye-catching yellow cycles are available at the Tourist Information Office. You need to register, then the first two hours are free. And do try the little electric ferry, shuttling across the Old Port.</p><img id="i-e61dc0a7313106f6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/20/15/40909B8700000578-0-image-a-31_1495289681708.jpg" height="430" width="634" alt="La Rochelle's main market (pictured) is open every morning, selling ingredients to make a MasterChef contestant drool" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5. Market choices</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This city means serious gastronomical business. Its main market is open every morning, selling ingredients to make a MasterChef contestant drool. There’s the nutty-tasting butter of Surgeres in the local Charente region, red eggs from Marans, and tourteau de charente, a cheesecake burned black on the top. At the harbour I found mounds of oysters, mussels and prawns.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>6. Historic heart</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Old La Rochelle grew rich on international trade and merchants left a handsome legacy, including 16th and 17th Century houses, built around restful courtyards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the best is in the Cloister of the White Ladies, now government offices. Think Versailles, only smaller, and painted in ochre to give it an Italian look. Rue Nicholas Venette is so picturesque that it has two stars in the coveted Michelin Guide.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For more information, visit <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://en-charente-maritime.com/">en-charente-maritime.com</a> and <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://uk.voyages-sncf.com/">uk.voyages-sncf.com</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The Mail on Sunday's Gareth Huw Davis lists the French city's best attractions; from St Nicolas Tower at La Rochelle's old harbour (pictured) to its daily food market and ancient courtyards.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The worst thing about a long-haul flight is, without doubt, the food. Forget turbulence, screaming toddlers or unexplained delays, meal times on a plane are almost universally unpleasant — and often stomach-churning — experiences.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At best, the food is edible. At worst, it’s a scalding hot plastic tub of gloopy stew, overcooked rice or leathery meat and vegetables that have been boiled beyond all recognition.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chef Gordon Ramsay is certainly no fan. He recently revealed he refuses to eat on planes, bringing his own spread to keep him going.</p><img id="i-ed0b5251f5206ddd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/19/21/3F64A41600000578-4426668-image-a-1_1492635129899.jpg" height="822" width="634" alt="At best, the food in a plane is edible. At worst, it’s a scalding hot plastic tub of gloopy stew" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I worked on airlines for ten years, so I know where this food’s been and where it goes, and how long it took before it got on board,’ he said. Ramsay, it must be acknowledged, has a vested interest in knocking in-flight cuisine. His restaurant, Plane Food, based in Heathrow’s Terminal 5, sells takeaway boxes designed to be eaten at 35,000ft. But is he right? Is it really all that bad? We reveal the unappetising truth about airline meals . . .</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>ROLL OUT THE READY MEALS — ONE BILLION EVERY YEAR</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whether you sit in first or cattle class, the food comes from the same place: an industrial kitchen near the airport, where it’s cooked before take-off — then reheated on board.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Europe, most meals come from Gate Gourmet in Switzerland or LSG Sky Chefs in Germany — serving more than 260 airlines.</p><img id="i-3fd24be35410175" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/19/22/3F6517E100000578-4426668-image-m-13_1492636565921.jpg" height="572" width="634" alt="In Europe, most meals come from Gate Gourmet in Switzerland or LSG Sky Chefs in Germany — serving more than 260 airlines" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most of these industrial kitchens prepare around 25,000 meals a day; the world’s biggest, the Emirates Flight Catering Centre in Dubai, makes up to 170,000. That’s 58 million bread rolls, 4,300 tons of chicken and 3.6 tons of lobster a year. Peter Jones, a retired professor of travel catering from Surrey University, says one billion airline meals are consumed annually in an industry worth £10 billion a year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The challenge isn’t the food,’ he says, ‘it is getting the food and the other items on board. A jumbo jet needs 40,000 separate items loaded every flight, sometimes in 90 minutes.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>DON’T BE FOOLED BY ‘FRESH’ — IT COULD BE 72 HOURS OLD</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite stickers claiming it is ‘freshly prepared’, most plane food is produced long before it is served to passengers. Usually, the meals are made between 12 and 72 hours in advance. But, adds Prof Jones: ‘It can be kept in a chilled stage for five days under the internationally recognised food hygiene standards.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Salads, desserts, bread rolls, plastic cutlery and napkins are put on trays in catering units on the ground and then stacked in trolleys ready to be wheeled down the cabin aisle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hot dishes are made in large industrial pans and decanted into plastic containers with foil lids before being ‘blast chilled’ to around 5C in 90 minutes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They’re then stacked in chilled metal boxes until they’re taken on board the plane.<strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>IF IT TASTES PLASTIC, THAT’S BECAUSE IT IS!</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">First class passengers like to think they’re getting freshly cooked meals. But their food is also prepared on the ground, though it may be plated up in the first-class cabin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some chefs provide ‘step-by-step’ assembly instructions to help cabin crew present more intricate dishes — so even if the dishes come from the same place, at least they look more appealing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s also the benefit of metal knives and forks over the infamous plastic cutlery that is provided to economy passengers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not only is the latter very fiddly to use, but scientists have shown that it makes food taste worse — because of a phenomenon known as ‘sensation transference’, which converts a negative visual sensation into an unpleasant flavour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prof Charles Spence, an Oxford University psychologist and author of Gastrophysics: The New Science Of Eating, says: ‘We’ve shown that if you have heavy cutlery you rate food better and will pay more. Plastic takes you down by ten per cent.’<strong></strong></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>CHOOSE THE STEW (AND AVOID PASTA)</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s only one way to ensure your food isn’t dried out and disgusting: choose the sauciest option. Stews, soups or casseroles always taste best on board.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">French chef Raymond Oliver is credited with coming up with the ‘wetter is better’ theory in 1973, when he created beef bourguignon, coq au vin and veal in cream sauce as the three staple dishes for a new French airline. The meals were a roaring success and soon began to appear on all European planes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stew is a safe choice because it’s packed full of umami — a meaty, savoury flavour — which compensates for the blandness of most on-board meals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘You often have dishes with tomato, parmesan or mushrooms; this allows you to make food tastier without adding too much salt,’ explains Prof Spence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the other hand, pasta, noodle and rice-based dishes are best avoided. They don’t hold their texture when reheated. ‘It just goes into a big lump,’ says James Griffith, assistant vice-president at Emirates Flight Catering. Another no-no is fried food, which turns soggy and flavourless when heated for a second time.</p><img id="i-ecbbef651620bf90" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/19/22/3F6517E100000578-4426668-image-m-15_1492636673333.jpg" height="575" width="634" alt="Conditions inside the plane dull our senses and make food and drink seem blander than normal" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>BRING YOUR OWN SALT AND PEPPER</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Conditions inside the plane dull our senses and make food and drink seem blander than normal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prof Barry Smith, of the Centre For The Study Of Senses at University of London, says: ‘The environment of an aircraft is about the most hostile to having a good dining experience that you could imagine.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At 30,000 ft, humidity is less than 12 per cent: drier than most deserts. This dehydrates our nose, making it harder to smell food and appreciate its flavour, while low air pressure numbs our tastebuds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A 2010 study at the Fraunhofer Institute For Building Physics showed our perception of saltiness falls by up to 30 per cent on a plane, while our sense of sweetness plummets by 20 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So even if a dish is perfectly cooked and seasoned on the ground, in the air it could be tasteless — meaning those little sachets of salt, pepper and even tabasco sauce could come in handy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Airline chefs compensate by adding hot spices such as chilli and wasabi. We detect the kick from spicy food through the trigeminal nerve in the nose, which is unaffected by flying.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>A NICE CUPPA? SORRY, NOT AT THIS ALTITUDE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The low cabin pressure means water boils at 90C, not the usual 100C, resulting in a poor cup of tea. Meanwhile, passengers’ dry sinuses can alter the taste of coffee.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s also the matter of the water. Aircraft coffee isn’t always made with bottled water; rather, the drinking water on board a plane, which — though clean — is far from high quality.</p><img id="i-f2aea9d3f6226e24" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/19/22/3F6517E100000578-4426668-image-m-17_1492636734203.jpg" height="564" width="634" alt="The low cabin pressure means water boils at 90C, not the usual 100C, resulting in a poor cup of tea" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Short layovers mean there is little time to clean the valves in the pipes, resulting in a build-up of minerals and grit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some airlines have compensated by coming up with different blends of our favourite hot drinks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Singapore Airlines created a special plane coffee (with more flavoursome Robusta beans than the usual Arabica blend); while Twinings designed a ‘high tea’ which is intended to taste good when brewed at a lower temperature.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>HESTON’S PIE IS A FREQUENT FLYER</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some airlines offer truly world-class cuisine, by partnering with celebrity chefs who help devise their menus — and have strict instructions for how they should be prepared, cooked and served.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Virgin Atlantic contracted model-turned-chef Lorraine Pascale to come up with Thai beef salad and chilli con carne, while Heston Blumenthal’s collaboration with British Airways involved shepherd’s pie with a seaweed crust.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The involvement of high-profile chefs has led to increased control over the ingredients and presentation of the food.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Strict regulations on the weight capacity of planes means there is also much scrutiny over recipes, which are astonishingly exact — even in economy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ingredients — right down to the sprinkle of flat-leaf parsley on top of a tomato consommé — are measured out to a hundredth of a gram. This can help companies save vast sums of money, too. In the Eighties, American Airlines realised it could save £31,000 a year by removing a single olive from each passenger’s salad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>IT'S A BAD IDEA TO WHINE AND DINE </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The noise of a whirring jumbo jet engine — which can reach an ear-splitting 85 decibels — can ruin a good meal. This is because it’s akin to white noise — random collections of sounds at different frequencies — which is distracting to the human brain and diminishes our sense of taste.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prof Spence explains: ‘Background noise suppresses the ability to taste sweet and salty, but enhances the ability to taste umami, the meaty, savoury taste you find in food such as tomatoes. ‘It’s been shown that a large number of people only drink Bloody Marys, made from vodka, tomatoes and Worcestershire sauce, when flying.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Experts advise listening to soothing music or using sound-cancelling headphones to counteract the engine’s dulling effect.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2014, BA devised a music menu to be enjoyed alongside its meals on long-haul flights, including Debussy’s Clair De Lune paired with roast dinner and Scottish singer Paolo Nutini with a smoked salmon starter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>CHOCS AWAY, BUT DON’T LET IT MELT</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As ANYONE who’s ever tucked into a chilled, cardboard-like cake on a plane can attest, airline chefs tend to prioritise practicality over taste when it comes to your onboard dessert. Chocolate is almost always used because it acts like a glue, keeping layers of pastry, cake or mousse together and stopping them from disintegrating before take-off.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The only problem is its tendency to melt when placed beside the hot main course, meaning all the desserts are chilled before they’re served to passengers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Scientists don’t know why, but sophisticated seasonings such as cardamom, ginger and cinnamon taste even more intense in the sky, so these are often found in plane puddings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>TAKE A TIPPLE BEFORE YOUR TASTEBUDS DRY</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wines that taste amazing on the ground can lose all their flavour mid-flight. Subtle fruit flavours are diminished and drinkers are left with bitter tannins.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is because the liquid thins out and becomes leaner in the air, in response to changing atmospheric pressure. As a result, most airlines serve younger, fruitier reds over light whites.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prof Smith says the best wines on board are those grown on mountains, such as Argentinian Malbec, produced at 5,500ft, where air pressure is close to that found in aircraft cabins.</p><img id="i-f2a250d358c260c4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/19/22/3F6517E100000578-4426668-image-m-19_1492636834809.jpg" height="563" width="634" alt="Whatever your tipple, experts advise drinking it early in the flight (before your tastebuds dry out) and not indulging too much" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even better, however, are sparkling drinks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">’Champagne is a winner because it has a flavour delivery system of its own,’ says Prof Smith.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The bubbles rise in the mouth and nose and are coated with liquid so they deliver the odour and flavour.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whatever your tipple, experts advise drinking it early in the flight (before your tastebuds dry out) and not indulging too much.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Low air pressure has been shown to thin the blood, meaning the concentration of alcohol in our body — and its effects — can be stronger on a plane.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>GIVE THAT FOLDING TRAY A GOOD WIPING</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Food poisoning incidents on planes are rare. But, just in case, caterers keep a sample of every meal cooked to check later if there are complaints.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And pilots and co-pilots are served different foods, to avoid the risk of the entire cockpit falling ill.</p><img id="i-acf35e0abcc51b87" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/19/22/3F6517E100000578-4426668-image-m-21_1492636866456.jpg" height="567" width="634" alt="Whenever you fly, hygiene experts advise bringing disinfectant wipes on board" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whenever you fly, hygiene experts advise bringing disinfectant wipes on board. Fold-down trays are thought to be the dirtiest surfaces on a plane, with more bacteria than a toilet seat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Former airline worker Allison Hope last year warned against putting food down on your tray. ‘Sadly, they are cleaned far less than you’d be comforted to know,’ she revealed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>AND YOU’LL END UP FEELING SWELL . . .</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The low pressure makes your body swell — noticeably the feet, but also your internal organs. Engorged intestines struggle to digest food, so you feel bloated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nutritionists recommend foods that require the least amount of oxygen to digest: carbohydrates such as potatoes, beans and nuts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The average plane meal is far from healthy, with around 360-400 calories per food item (so roughly 1,500 calories total) and high quantities of fat, salt and sugar.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prof Jones says: ‘Airlines are not hugely concerned about nutrition because their view is that one meal consumed by a passenger will not make the slightest bit of difference to them out of the thousands of meals they consume.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>At best, the food is edible.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">My boyfriend and I have a long-running argument about which country makes the best food - France or Italy - and my loyalty has always been with our Gallic neighbours.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">But after visiting the Amalfi coast this summer, I might be forced to admit defeat. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">From the fresh seafood and the Neapolitan pizza, to the local lemons that flavour everything from souffle to limoncello, it is virtually impossible to leave the coastal holiday destination at least a few pounds heavier.</font></p><img id="i-1d8a9504f01ca5dd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/09/27/13/38D7559200000578-3807573-image-a-52_1474980584421.jpg" height="640" width="962" alt="The Amalfi coast, named after the town of Amalfi (pictured) has some of the best restaurants in the world " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">There are many things people should do before they have kids, including camp at a music festival and go backpacking around a foreign country, but a gastronomic tour of the Amalfi towns has to be up there with the rest.   </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">The idyllic Italian coastline that stretches for 31 miles has long been a hot spot for both Italians and foreign tourists, since Roman times in fact, thanks to the beautiful views of the sea, the delicious food and the perfect weather.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">But unlike many other tourist magnets, the Unesco world heritage site has managed to maintain most of its charm without succumbing to cheap bars and tacky restaurants. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Keen to see everything that the area had to offer, my boyfriend and I booked hotels in the three different areas of Sorrento, Capri and Amalfi - something that is easily mastered with a package from a tour operator like Citalia that creates private multi-stop holidays.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"></font></p><img id="i-b286e6c6154a2bd9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/10/03/09/390CD50300000578-3807573-image-m-3_1475484578764.jpg" height="473" width="470" alt="The Imperial Hotel Tramontano is  one of very few places in the centre of Sorrento  to have lift access to a private beach" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-d7a9888a3d73fa74" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/10/03/09/38D5FE2300000578-3807573-The_Imperial_Hotel_Tramontano_is_one_of_very_few_places_in_the_c-a-4_1475484587876.jpg" height="473" width="470" alt="The Imperial Hotel Tramontano  is  one of very few places in the centre of Sorrento  to have lift access to a private beach" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">We started off in Sorrento at the Imperial Hotel Tramontano, a 16th-century property overlooking the bay of Naples that has played host to literary greats including Milton, Byron, Scott, Keats and Shelley, which is also one of few places in the town centre to have lift access to a private beach. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Just a five-minute walk away in the quaint old fishing village is the Ristorante O'Puledrone,  owned by a co-operative of eight fisherman who work in the bay of Naples right opposite - they also organise fishing trips for those who want to catch what they eat.</font></p><img id="i-c7381ac3f11614e7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/09/27/13/38CF0F1A00000578-3807573-image-a-45_1474980325273.jpg" height="349" width="470" alt="The Marina Grande, just five minutes from the centre of Sorrento is one of the best places to find good seafood in thetown" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">The menu is dictated by whatever has been caught that day, so we dined on home-marinated anchovies, mussels, tubettoni pasta with a gulf seafood sauce and clam spaghetti, washed down with a local white wine. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Despite eating and drinking until we were fit to burst, our meal cost only 30 euros a head - I am convinced there isn't a better meal to be had on the whole of the coast for that price.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">The following day, after a long stroll around the sites, we ducked into Cafe Latino on the Corso Italia for some much-needed pizza to soak up the previous night's hangover, for a meal set in their beautiful terrace  in an orange and lemon tree garden.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Their specialty pizza, topped with baked aubergine and smoked cheese has to be tasted to be believed.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Neapolitan pizza is famous throughout the world and the Amalfi coast's proximity to the city - it has the closest international airport, so most visitors fly in and out of there - means that it is rare to find a bad pizza.  </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">After a couple of days in Sorrento, we headed over to the island of Capri for two nights at the Punta Tragara hotel, a cliff-side property overlooking the famous Faraglioni rocks that played host to the likes of General Eisenhower and Sir Winston Churchill during World War Two. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">The hotel has the best spot on the island and they know it - everything plays to the incredible views from every room, as well as the outside bar, the restaurant and the two pools. </font></p><img id="i-12424fc3f2bb2618" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/09/27/13/38D60AF400000578-3807573-image-a-42_1474980313627.jpg" height="395" width="470" alt="The five-star Punta Tragara hotel is a one-of-a-kind cliff-side property overlooking the famous Faraglioni rocks in Capri" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-6e024e188b278fe1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/09/27/13/38D60AF800000578-3807573-image-a-43_1474980315208.jpg" height="395" width="470" alt="The five-star Punta Tragara hotel is a one-of-a-kind cliff-side property overlooking the famous Faraglioni rocks in Capri" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">The hotel is also home to one of the island's best restaurants Monzu, which serves a Michelin-star worthy menu that features several Capri and Neapolitan dishes with a twist. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Weeks later, I still haven't been able to get the local snapper with prickly lettuce and red garlic out of my head, or an ingenious pudding of strawberries, mint, lemons and orange that was brewed on top of a candle during our meal, then poured over sorbet.  </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">If you are lucky enough to be able to visit Capri, make sure to stay the night as it is a completely different place after the last ferry has left at 5.30pm back to the mainland, emptying it of thousands of day-trippers. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">No matter what the time of day is though, it remains eye-wateringly expensive, so be prepared to part with some hard-earned cash. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Although if you really do only have a fiver to spend, there is no better place than the Gelateria Buonocore -

Yet tipping is a vital part of cruise-ship life, oiling the wheels of service. The question is: when and how much? </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">A useful rule of thumb is to think of the French term for tipping, pourboire, which literally means ‘for a drink’ — so you should give enough to buy a drink. Even so, tipping remains a minefield. </font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">While Americans gaily dispense greenbacks to anyone who so much as opens a door, the British are far more squeamish. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Because we’re so bad at it, many cruise companies now bundle the tips into the bill. In other words, you pay the tips upfront, meaning you don’t have to worry about bringing a stash of fivers. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">In a way, it’s more relaxing, though some feel it means tipping is no longer a way of rewarding good service.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Make sure you find out the ship policy when you book. The daily tipping rate can vary hugely: while P&amp;O suggests £3.50 a day per adult, Celebrity Cruises suggests £13 per passenger staying in a suite. But remember, with most companies all tipping is voluntary, so if you really want to, you can ask to take it off the bill, then tip at your own discretion. </font></p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS travel" id="ce15ddc0-8556-11e6-bd51-ddc35a214ff7">                            <h3 class="wocc">                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">WILL MY BUTLER BE EXPECTING A GIFT?  </span>                            </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared xolcc bdrcc">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">‘It’s not necessary for guests to buy a gift for their butler — however, it is a lovely gesture and it would be impolite not to accept,’ says Valentin Gradescu, senior butler on Uniworld.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">‘We like to delight our guests with small gifts and souvenirs, reflecting the region visited that day.’</font></p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong>WHAT’S INCLUDED? </strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">The days when cruises were just for the rich and famous — Walt Disney, Cary Grant, Marlene Dietrich, David Niven and Clark Gable were all regulars — are long gone. But the bar bill after ten days at sea can still be alarming. The best advice here is: ‘Forewarned, forearmed.’ </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Some cruises will tempt you with surprisingly cheap deals, then charge for all sorts of extras on-board. Others claim to be all-inclusive — but aren’t entirely. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Almost all cruises these days are cashless: passengers are issued with ‘sign and sail’ cards, which act as your room key, ID card and credit card. These have to be linked to your credit card beforehand, and your total bill is discreetly slipped under your door on your final night.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong>HOW DO I PACK? </strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Amazingly, there is no limit on the amount of luggage you can bring on most big cruises, so long as each item doesn’t exceed the 23kg weight limit. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">A Caribbean cruise will mean swimsuits and light clothing, while if you’re heading to the Northern Lights, a ski-suit will be handy for star-gazing on deck. For a European cruise that stops at several ports, you may do a lot of shopping, so bring a spare suitcase. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">You will, of course, want to bring a camera and binoculars. And, yes, you can bring your dogs, too. Elizabeth Taylor travelled everywhere with her two poodles, and Cunard runs a ‘pets on deck’ scheme for cats and dogs aboard the Queen Mary 2 between Southampton and New York. </font></p><img id="i-284afd2090cb1b5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/09/28/09/38DECC5500000578-3809375-image-a-2_1475051707180.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="What to pack? A Caribbean cruise will mean swimsuits and light clothing, while if you’re heading to the Northern Lights, a ski-suit will be handy for star-gazing on deck" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">This means that, so long as your pooch isn’t enormous (i.e. not a Great Dane), it can be accommodated in the ship’s kennels for a fee (£600 for an upper kennel and £750 for a lower, per crossing). </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">All pets must be vaccinated, microchipped and have a passport, and there’s even a play area and outside walking area, which is being upgraded. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong>WHAT NOT TO PACK </strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Don’t try to smuggle a bar on-board — cruise companies take a dim view of passengers bringing their own booze. As with boarding a plane, firearms and weapons are a big no-no, as are recreational drugs and fireworks. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Less obviously, candles and incense are usually banned, so bring a flameless candle for bathtime. Sports equipment such as tennis rackets or golf clubs will be provided if tennis and putting are offered. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong>CAPTAIN’S TABLE </strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">How to get invited to the captain’s table is one of the greatest mysteries of cruising. It’s the golden ticket. On boarding, dress to impress, so that the welcoming host will notice you. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Old-­timers and those loyal to a particular ship or line will often be invited, as will anyone with personal connections to the company or staff. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">If you come into contact with any officers or senior staff during your cruise, be on sparkling form. But if your shameless networking doesn’t work, try the opposite tack and be a difficult customer. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Complaining about a cabin — particularly if you’re in a suite — is a sure-fire way to get asked, as cruise firms use the captain’s table as a way to keep tricky passengers on-side. </font></p><img id="i-e144e8bf979dce99" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/09/28/09/38DECC6700000578-3809375-image-a-1_1475051658589.jpg" height="801" width="634" alt="Solo sailing: What could be more romantic than to meet your new love at sea?" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong>GOING TOPLESS? </strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">There was a time when women would bathe topless on cruise ships. However, these days, it tends to be frowned upon. Some ships do have designated areas just for topless sunbathing, usually on the top deck. On Carnival ships, it used to be the area around the funnel. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong>MAKING FRIENDS </strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Parties, dinners and dances are a big part of life at sea, so have your wittiest repartee at the ready. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">As for making new friends, be sure to keep your options open. Play it safe at the start by hanging back: don’t rush headlong into making New Best Friends Forever. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">You don’t want to get stuck with the ship bores by being too enthusiastic early on. Be careful not to reveal your cabin number — you might need to beat a hasty retreat. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong>GO THE EXTRA MILE </strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Developing a rapport with your room steward or butler is not just polite, it’s essential. A good butler will make the difference between having an OK time and feeling like Greta Garbo. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">They will go the extra mile for you, whether it’s repacking mountains of shopping or making dinner reservations. Some will even run you a bath or mix a martini. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Uniworld Senior Butler ­Valentin Gradescu enjoys giving returning guests the red-carpet treatment: ‘A few years ago, we arranged a limousine transfer from the train station to the ship for a couple who had travelled with us many times. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">‘I met them at the station in full regalia — white gloves, a fresh white rose in my lapel... they were speechless.

No. But all cruise companies have a dress code that spells out what is required. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Many cruises will expect you to dress for dinner on at least one night, so you’ll need black tie — which, for ladies, means bringing a choice of outfits. If in doubt, dress up, rather than down. Nobody minds if you are over-dressed. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">On most cruises, there will be formal nights and casual nights, with approximately one or two formal nights per week.</font></p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong>PARTY RULES </strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Don’t feel you have to stick to the social schedule laid on by the captain — a cruise allows you to be centre of a new social scene, with people you may never see again. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">So if you meet a few couples who seem fun, why not organise a party in your cabin? </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">If you worry that your guests might never leave, arrange the party on a formal dining night — that way, they can come ready-dressed, and you can kick them out before dinner. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong>BEST BEHAVIOUR</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">If you are asked to someone’s cabin, treat it as you would their home. Don’t sit on the bed unless they invite you to do so. Be complimentary about the cabin, even if it’s smaller than yours. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">And if you bring flowers (you should), take a vase — nobody wants the bother of finding somewhere to put them. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">And should you meet the man or woman of your dreams on-board, the rules of engagement are much the same as on land: don’t ask them back to yours on the first date. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"><span class="travel-ccox"><strong>TIME-KEEPING </strong></span></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">One of the joys of cruising is discovering so many new places. But keep abreast of the itinerary and allow plenty of time to be back on-board — the ship won’t wait for you even if you miss it by minutes. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">One fatal mistake is to confuse ship and local time — which can often be different. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong>GOING SOLO</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">What could be more romantic than to meet your new love at sea? </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">To spend hours arm-in-arm promenading on a windswept deck, just like Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in An Affair To Remember. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">OK, so you may not bump into a film star mid-Atlantic, but cruises are still the perfect place to meet people. Some companies give singletons’ receptions, while others — Cunard, Crystal and Silversea — offer ‘gentlemen’ dance hosts, to offer a hand when the band strikes up. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">For years, single travellers were penalised with a single-person supplement, but that’s all changing, as many ships now have super-studios, specially built for singletons.</font></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>For the well-bred Englishman, nothing is so vulgar as to grub around for small amounts of change.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It's a good thing we have mighty brains, because humans are pretty useless in the face of danger when it comes to wild animals. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">From lions on safari to sharks in the sea, and all those snakes and spiders in between, there are plenty of beasts on this planet that can harm you - and the best methods for defending yourself vary greatly according to which one you're dealing with.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">MailOnline Travel has consulted several survivalist experts and African safari guides to amass the ultimate worst-case-scenario guide, should you find yourself on the wrong side of a deadly predator. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong><span class="mol-style-large"><strong>Lions </strong></span></strong></font></p><img id="i-c9568c078b26d038" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/27/15/36A1D9C900000578-3710465-Yawn_or_roar_Lounging_around_at_the_very_top_of_the_food_chain_l-m-61_1469630302873.jpg" height="404" width="634" alt="Yawn or roar? Lounging around at the very top of the food chain, lions are pretty lazy most of the time but ferocious when they want to be" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>What to do:</strong> Make direct eye contact, and don’t break it. Back very slowly away. Never turn your back, never run. Lions will often do one or two mock charges before a full-on attack, running towards you but suddenly stopping a few paces away. If it does this, throw your arms out to make yourself look bigger and make as much noise as possible. Most often, this will make them reconsider and run off.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>How they kill:</strong> A lion will get their jaws around your windpipe and suffocate you to death. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong><span class="mol-style-large"><strong>Leopards </strong></span></strong></font></p><img id="i-38d4db08372b9cca" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/27/14/36A2F46F00000578-3710465-image-a-36_1469626163834.jpg" height="420" width="634" alt="Recent kill: The leopard is a very solitary big cat that hunts alone, and  can be very difficult to spot until you are far too close to it" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>What to do:</strong> Unlike with lions, never make direct eye contact. They will view this as a challenge. Stand very still. Leopards don’t always mock charge. If they come for you, as with a lion, make yourself look big and brave and make lots of noise.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>How they kill: </strong>Suffocation, in the same grim manner as lions. They do this partly for a silent death, since if competing predators hear a kill, they will often try and steal it.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong><span class="mol-style-large"><strong>Elephants</strong></span></strong></font></p><img id="i-620490a303993f1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/27/14/36A276E000000578-3710465-image-a-37_1469626178091.jpg" height="424" width="634" alt="Don't be fooled: Elephants may appear to be slow and friendly - they aren’t - they're fast and easily infuriated" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>What to do: </strong>Stand your ground and pretend to be brave. The elephant will flap its ears aggressively and toot. Don’t move. It will almost always do one or two mock charges. Make yourself appear as big and loud and possible. Hope that works, then get downwind if possible so the others can't smell you.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>How they kill: </strong>An elephant gores its victim with its tusks and tramples them to death.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong><span class="mol-style-large"><strong>Buffalo</strong></span></strong></font></p><img id="i-3387928837f8ee82" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/27/14/36A1D9BD00000578-3710465-image-a-41_1469626284223.jpg" height="411" width="634" alt="Don't mess: Found in herds of up to several thousand, buffalo possess the build of a cow but the disposition of a perpetually furious bull - and they don’t flee from a threat like most prey animals, they turn and fight" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>What to do:</strong> Run like the wind and accept almost certain defeat. Buffalo don’t mock charge. They give no warning at all. You'll never outrun a buffalo, nor survive them in combat, so your only option is to get a head start and climb a tree.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>How they kill: </strong>As with an elephant, it will gore you with its horns and trample you into an early grave.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong><span class="mol-style-large"><strong>Hippos  </strong></span></strong></font></p><img id="i-39a8689ed5e73aa" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/27/14/36A1D9B900000578-3710465-image-a-51_1469626601802.jpg" height="437" width="634" alt="Open wide: Hippos are responsible for more human deaths in Africa than any other wild animal by far - what you really don’t want to do is to get between a hippo and its body of water, it will see this as a direct threat" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>What to do:</strong> Hippos can reach running speeds of up to 30 miles per hour, so it will catch you every time. Still, your best bet is to sprint to the closest cover or climb a tree.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>How they kill: </strong>Its jaws and teeth somewhat resemble a giant hole punch, and a hippo won’t do the decent thing and bite off your head, it will go for your mid-section and bite you clean in half.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong><span class="mol-style-large"><strong>African Wild Dogs</strong></span></strong></font></p><img id="i-e15f84e478f54402" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/27/14/36A1D9B100000578-3710465-image-a-52_1469626611014.jpg" height="533" width="634" alt="Light lunch: These dogs hunt in large packs, and they are vicious and formidable - once they’ve singled out a victim, their success rate is around 80 percent,  a lion’s success rate being only around 30 percent" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>What to do:</strong> Say your prayers. You can’t outrun them, intimidate them or fight back. But do know that they aren't generally interested in attacking humans.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>How they kill:</strong> Savagely, but relatively fast. Wild Dogs are unusual in that they won’t kill you first, they will eat you alive, disembowelling you first. The good news is that they work quickly and their victim is usually dead within a minute.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong><span class="mol-style-large"><strong>Domestic dogs</strong></span></strong></font></p><img id="i-7f6dc162a6aa8ea3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/27/14/36A276E800000578-3710465-image-a-44_1469626345565.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Don't paws! It's rare for a domestic dog to attack a human, but they can be bred and trained to do so, and when they are they're very effective at it" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>What to do:</strong> Running is not an option, you'll have to stand and fight, literally. Close your hands into a fist - you'll probably do this instinctively anyway. Shout at the dog authoritatively but don't make eye contact. Kick and punch it; and if it rolls you to the ground, protect your throat and back of your neck with your arms, then when you get the chance, aim to jab it in the eye.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>How they kill:</strong> Generally by puncturing an artery, causing the victim to bleed to death. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong><span class="mol-style-large"><strong>Sharks </strong></span></strong></font></p><img id="i-1e441cc9d6ca570a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/27/14/36A2770A00000578-3710465-image-a-45_1469626368565.jpg" height="511" width="634" alt="Chomp: There a many different species of shark but great whites (pictured) are the most lethal to humans" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>What to do:</strong> Sharks will generally only approach you out of curiosity, or if it mistakes you for a seal in distress. So don't thrash about. But it’s probably too late for that. If at all possible, punch it in the nose with all your might. It’s the most sensitive part of its body and might lead it to swim away defeated. Remember though, only an average of four fatal great white attacks take place each year worldwide.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>How they kill:</strong> This death is catastrophic. A shark probably won’t bother killing you because they aren't fond of the taste of humans. Most commonly they will take a chunk out of your thigh or abdomen, and if that severs an artery you’ll bleed out. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong><strong>Crocodiles</strong></strong></font></p><img id="i-232652d44de36682" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/27/14/36A276F500000578-3710465-image-a-46_1469626379339.jpg" height="373" width="634" alt="Care for a swim? Comfortably the world’s largest reptile, the crocodile is an extremely successful predator that reportedly kills on average 2,500 people a year" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>What to do: </strong>You have zero options if a crocodile  ambushes you from a riverbank, unless it happens to miss, in which case run away before it goes for round two. If you see one on land, it's unlikely to approach, but if it does, again, run away - not in zig-zags as the common myth dictates. Crocodiles can only reach ten miles an hour on foot.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>How they kill:</strong> This is about as bad as it gets. Because they can’t chew, crocodiles bite down hard on their prey then spin it round to tear chunks of flesh off, which they gulp down whole - and they don't care that you're not dead yet. Incidentally, they are far more likely to attack humans than alligators are.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong><strong>Bears </strong></strong></font></p><img id="i-47fb6f7f35c4086d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/27/14/36A2771700000578-3710465-image-a-47_1469626392257.jpg" height="426" width="634" alt="An aptly-named beast: Most species of bear won't attack a human - most, except the grizzly bear (pictured)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>What to do:</strong> Don't climb a tree, for obvious reasons. Don't run either, bears are fast. And don't yell at it, it will spook the bear into believing it is threatened. As hard as it seems, try at least to appear calm, slowly extend your arms to make yourself bigger, speak to it in a low voice to identify yourself as human, and shuffle gradually away to show you're retreating.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>How they kill: </strong>Bears generally maul their victims to death - as anyone who's seen The Revenant will know - especially since they're not attacking you to eat you, they're doing it because you've enraged them. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong><strong>Venomous snakes</strong></strong></font></p><img id="i-89dde8d4e008920f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/27/14/36A276CF00000578-3710465-image-a-48_1469626399911.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Forking Hell: There are countless snake varieties and only some of them venomous, but they're almost always shy and avoiding of humans" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>What to do:</strong> If you come across a snake, back away slowly and change your course. If it looks like it's following you, stamp on the ground to make vibrations in the ground, which should drive it away. If you are bitten, bring your affected body part down lower than your heart to slow the flow of venom in your bloodstream (if it's a limb) and get to the nearest hospital. Try and remember, or better still photograph, the snake so doctors can faster identify which anti-venom you need.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>How they kill:</strong> The formula of snake victim is different for every breed, but either it will shut your heart down, paralyse your muscles or clot your blood so thick it will stop flowing.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Punctuality is something many people struggle with - especially in an age where technology has made it easier than ever to let people know you might be late.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">However tardy timekeepers may be glad to know over in Mexico,  turning up half an hour late is entirely acceptable, and in Morocco  you can be anything from an hour to a day late without anyone batting an eyelid.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But those keen to adhere to scheduled times needn't panic as Japan and Germany are sticklers for punctuality with the latter even requiring you to be early for meetings, a new infographic reveals.</font></p><img id="i-5224c3a95c8815cd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/26/14/369A9CB800000578-3708645--m-51_1469538750406.jpg" height="920" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Free online gaming website <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mrgamez.com/punctuality/">Mr Gamez </a>has created a study to find how much and how little value different nations around the world place on punctuality  - and the results differ enormously.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In South Korea people view being late as a sign of disrespect.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But in Malaysia saying you will be five minutes late usually means an hour and being late is an accepted norm that does not require an apology.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In China it is not considered late if you arrive within 10 minutes of the agreed time, but in  Japan, if a train arrives more than one minute after it is scheduled to, it is considered late.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">On the other side of the Pacific it is not uncommon for people to turn up half an hour late for a scheduled meeting in Mexico</font></p><img id="i-adba08c2d4a1d9d6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/26/14/369A9CB400000578-3708645-image-m-50_1469538736802.jpg" height="926" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Thanks to its industrial past, in Germany you are expected to arrive at least 10 minutes early for any scheduled meeting.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But down in Nigeria if a meeting is scheduled at 1pm, that means the meeting will start any time between 1pm and 2pm.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Similarly in Saudi Arabia time is not such an important commodity, with people frequently turning up half an hour late to meetings.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Let’s go to Japan, my wife said. ‘Why Japan?’ I asked. ‘Because it’s an old civilisation, we see its products everywhere and I don’t know anything about it. And, anyway, you love the food.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">So that was it. We went — and what an experience it was.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you want a holiday in a safe, ultra‑modern country where everything is both familiar and utterly strange, then Japan is the place.</font></p><img id="i-ea5d5c7ae480bd3a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/16/11/35D2E02C00000578-3693181-image-a-5_1468663567912.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Bright lights, big city: Tokyo goes neon in this photograph of the Akihabara district" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-fa1c98d012180035" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/16/11/35D3DA4100000578-3693181-image-a-7_1468663573019.jpg" height="459" width="306" alt="A woman wearing a traditional kimono" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The contrasts are everywhere, as we found when we arrived in Tokyo and went to our hotel, the Andaz, not far from the Imperial Palace.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Our room on the 50th floor had a traditional circular bath where two could sit and soak, a computerised toilet where the heated seat opened when you approached it and a floor-to-ceiling window commanding panoramic views of the combined megalopolis that is Tokyo and Yokohama.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">We looked out in awe over a cityscape of more than 30 million people crammed together, cheek by jowl. How could it possibly work?</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">We could see illuminated radio masts, neon lights flashing in the night sky and vast video screens on hoardings blaring adverts to shoppers.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">We went out and plunged into the underground — a vast network of subway lines around the city — and then it was off south from Tokyo at 200 mph on the white snake that is the Shinkansen bullet train. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Celebrated for its punctuality, it is worth going to Japan for this alone, from the pirouetting performed by the platform managers to the polite bowing of the guards whenever they entered or exited our carriage.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The cities flashed by, crammed with grey high-rises, factories and homes. What passes as country — fields and ribbon developments — are squashed in between.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">We were heading south to Naoshima, where Benesse, a Japanese lifelong-learning corporation, is turning this small island in the Inland Sea into an experiment in art and nature.</font></p><div>

Fortunately, our guide, Mazda San, had given up banking to devote himself to this historic former Imperial capital, which was mercifully spared the American bombs of World War II.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As we explored the sloping-roofed Shinto shrines and the wooden Buddhist temples with their pagodas and enchanting gardens, Mazda San explained that the Japanese are pragmatic about their approach to practising religion.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Sensibly, they like to combine the best elements of the two faiths and add a dash of Confucianism to produce a society dedicated to wah — harmony in all things. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Our trip ended with the physical harmony of the hot springs of a traditional ryokan. At the spa town of Izukogen, we stayed at Hanafubuki on the western coastline south of Mount Fuji.</font></p><img id="i-55c0fdc979f1b7cb" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/16/10/36548F5A00000578-3693181-image-a-3_1468659830015.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Kyoto is home to 400 Shinto shrines and more than 1,600 Buddhist temples.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The Colosseum has emerged more imposing than ever after its most extensive restoration, a €25million (£15million) clean up to remove decades of grime caused by traffic pollution in Rome. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Footing the bill is shoe-and-luxury goods maker Tod's. In an act of modern-day cultural patronage, company founder Diego Della Valle responded to a government call to the private sector to help care for Italy's art and archaeological treasures. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The Colosseum's new look was unveiled on Friday and during the ceremony Italy's culture minister, Dario Franceschini, announced that a further €18 million (£15million) has been found to replace the arena's floor, by the end of 2018.  </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;"><strong>Scroll down for video </strong></font></p><div class="artSplitter"><div>  <img id="i-474c04e4d2581d5e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/01/article-urn:publicid:ap.org:5ced4b3f0eed40dea9f75f293976164e-1m9RZRtXXO8cc109e1899d1a14f0-329_634x422.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="The Colosseum has emerged more imposing than ever after its most extensive restoration, a multi-million-euro cleaning to remove  soot and grime from the ancient arena" class="blkBorder img-share" />

</div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">A new floor might be used to support modern-day entertainment, although monument-rocking rock concerts have been ruled out.</font></p><div class="clear"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The stage would be used for 'cultural events of the highest level,' Franceschini said.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The first phase of the Colosseum's restoration consisted essentially of gently removing pollution's ravages on the exterior of the monument, which dates from the first century, with water misters and brushes wielded by hand. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The monument stayed open to tourists during the nearly three-year-long restoration of the outside, with scaffolding covering only one section at a time.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The exterior cleaning cost some €6.5 million  ($7.2million) (£5.4million).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Tod's is paying €25million (£20million) for the entire project, whose next steps include constructing a visitors' centre with a cafeteria and shoring up the bottom, where gladiators prepped, and wild beasts and scenery were kept for spectacles for the ancient Roman masses.</font></p><div class="artSplitter"><div>  <img id="i-2d95191fdafb5fc0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/01/article-urn:publicid:ap.org:5ced4b3f0eed40dea9f75f293976164e-1m9RZRtXXO8cc109e1899d1a1d5a-533_634x422.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="The grime on the ancient wonder has built up over the years due to pollution in traffic-clogged Rome" class="blkBorder img-share" />

</div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Della Valle received thanks today from Italy's Premier Matteo Renzi.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Companies ranging from Italian fashion houses to a mattress manufacturer to a Japanese textile maker have paid for restorations including the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps and Rome's own Pyramid.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Culture Minister Dario Franceschini pointed out that the shoe magnate was especially generous, since Della Valle offered the funds before a new Italian law took effect, in late 2014, giving modern-day versions of Medici princes of the arts huge tax breaks. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Under that new strategy, more than €100million ($112million) (£84million) have been donated, Franceschini said.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Architect Gisella Capponi, who directed the restoration, says the cleaning allows the Colosseum's creamy hues of travertine stone to be appreciated again.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">'The coloration highlights the monument' while the dirt and crime 'gave an image of being more a ruin than it really is,' she said.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Indeed, the stone had been so blackened that the Colosseum almost seemed to fade into the background for Romans who passed it daily on their commutes.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">But now 'the effect is one of surprise,' Colosseum director Rossella Rea said.</font></p><div class="artSplitter"><div>  <img id="i-7f9fde2d6a7d5487" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/01/article-urn:publicid:ap.org:5ced4b3f0eed40dea9f75f293976164e-4Ud0SXv69kde42ed3eb567d586f6-706_634x431.jpg" height="431" width="634" alt="Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi talks during a press conference inside the Colosseum, pictured today" class="blkBorder img-share" />

</div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Besides Della Valle's generosity, the Colosseum benefited from a city ordinance forbidding private cars on the nearby boulevard, which flanks Roman and Imperial Forums. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Taxis and buses, but not private cars, are allowed on weekdays. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">On weekends, only pedestrians and cyclists can use the boulevards.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Shopkeepers and other businesses in the area have complained bitterly about the traffic ban but Rea is unrepentant about the need to protect the arena, a Unesco World Heritage site that is considered Italy's most famous icon.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">'If the heavy traffic, which did the damage, returns, all you'll need is three, four years' to coat the Colosseum again in soot,' she said.</font></p><div class="artSplitter"><div>  <img id="i-2894f906b4acf8d4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/01/article-urn:publicid:ap.org:5ced4b3f0eed40dea9f75f293976164e-1m9RZRtXXO8cc109e1899d1a244f-190_634x422.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Tod's is paying 25 million euros (£20million) for the entire project, whose next steps include constructing a visitors' centre with a cafeteria.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Olive-oil sellers insist on preparing a taster of oil-dipped bread and cheese before allowing you to commit to buying. And while those oysters are not free (although they are dirt cheap at €12, or £9.50, for a dozen) the prosecco offered to ease them down is.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The first time we stumbled across this Syracusian version of fast food, we ordered six oysters and tried to pay but were waved away by the grinning, tattooed stallholder. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Relax, sit down and watch the world go by, was the general gist – you might find you want another plate in a minute or two, and naturally he was right.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It was the beginning of a daily habit: oysters and fizz, then a stroll down to the waterfront for sea urchin and spaghetti, or some wild boar salami at Fratelli Burgio.</font></p><img id="i-a09a321b3e78c811" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/05/07/11/33EB170F00000578-3578325-image-m-11_1462617096347.jpg" height="696" width="470" alt="Chef Giorgio Locatelli who recommended the restaurant Da Vittorio" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-9b367576a6543ee2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/05/07/11/33EB170B00000578-3578325-image-a-12_1462617103549.jpg" height="696" width="470" alt="At the top table: The Da Vittorio owner with some of his fresh produce" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Food is one of the main attractions of Sicily – simple dishes that allow the best quality ingredients to speak for themselves. And this being an island, the menus are packed with fish.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Ah fish. Now, I’m a committed carnivore who will always turn down a sea bream for beef, or lobster for lamb. But I can report that for the two weeks I was in Sicily, it was surf over turf all the way. And that was due to the humble restaurant that brought us to Sicily in the first place.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You need to put a pin in the map of Sicily if you are planning a holiday here. Even the experts are baffled as to where you should go in preference to somewhere else.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">We tried seeking counsel from the Thinking Traveller, which specialises in exclusive villas all over Sicily, but it was like asking a mother to choose between her children.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Palermo is a cultural must, every art historian’s favourite city. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Head for Agrigento and you will find the best preserved Doric temples outside Greece. At the Roman Villa del Casale, you’ll find the finest and largest display of mosaics in the world. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And then there’s the hilltop town of Taormina, fabled haunt of 19th and 20th Century writers and playground of movie stars. Can you see the problem?</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That is why it helps to have an inside tip. </font></p><img id="i-95415c671ae0818d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/05/07/11/33EB171300000578-3578325-image-a-3_1462617015669.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Hot stuff: When in Sicily you can’t afford to miss witnessing the highest active volcano in Europe, the spectacular Mount Etna" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Ours came in the form of the rumour that chef Giorgio Locatelli, owner of London’s renowned Locanda Locatelli, travels to Sicily every year to eat at the beachside Da Vittorio in Porto Palo di Menfi. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">There is a Signor Da Vittorio and he has been cooking – stripped to the waist, with a white cloth slung over one shoulder – for the past 40 years. It’s the kind of place you can’t believe still exists, especially not with renowned chefs shouting about it from the rooftops.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Waitresses, sometimes with a young child propped on their hip, will bring a menu if necessary but prefer to recommend what they think you’ll enjoy. And the most deliciously shocking part is the food is cheaper than most places on the island.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Here we discovered the Sicilian speciality gamberi rossi – red prawns that survive half a mile under the surface. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Perhaps there is something about that hostile environment produces a fatter, sweeter, denser shrimp the like of which you have never tasted before. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Also on the menu is swordfish on a bed of blood oranges, and fried baby squid. The wines were exceptional too, especially the whites Albamarina and Regaleali.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It turns out that picking a villa and a locale on the basis of its proximity to a respected beach restaurant is a very smart thing to do.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Hollywood actor Stanley Tucci (who is also a keen cook) was staying in another Thinking Traveller villa just a mile along the coast. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He had also booked a cooking course, one of the options the company provides – a chef turns up to help you prepare dinner in your kitchen and talk you through various regional specialities.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">From our villa, Casa Agave, the beach was just a short walk away, and it was practically deserted at the time of our visit.

Not everywhere in Sicily is a jewel. The part of the coast around Catania was rundown and grotty for the most part. It’s not helped by the dark volcanic rock that makes up its coastline and gives it a grim, coal-town look.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Somehow the sun didn’t shine so brightly here and the people seemed perplexed that we’d bothered to seek them out.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But even here, food is king, and the Sicilian respect for fresh fish plainly cooked seems to hold true wherever you go, so we continued to eat well, though instinct told us that further down the east coast we would find Ortigia and a very different world.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Ortigia has a modern sensibility – it’s like the Rome of Sicily, steeped in history but also full of hipsters on Vespas, women wearing Dolce &amp; Gabbana, and chic bars serving mojitos and caipirinhas.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">On our final night we found the perfect modern Sicilian restaurant, DiVino Mare – it’s so popular they have to seat people on both sides of the street.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The menu is on a blackboard, no one speaks English, and the fish is probably bought from our tattooed friend in the market.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">At €50, it’s the best food you’ll ever taste… unless you’re ever going west, that is, to Signor Da Vittorio’s little place of heaven.</font></p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel">                            <h3 class="wocc">                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">TRAVEL FACTS </span>                            </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared xolcc bdrcc">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The Thinking Traveller (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://thethinkingtraveller.com/">thethinkingtraveller.com</a>, 020 7377 8518) offers seven nights at Casa Agave from £2,924 per week. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">This includes electricity and gas, linen, bath towels, pool and beach towels, a comprehensive written guide to the villa and the local area, 24/7 local support, and the opportunity to book unique Think Experiences. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">British Airways (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://ba.com/">ba.com</a>) offers return flights from Heathrow to Palermo from £161. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">EasyJet (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://easyjet.com/">easyjet.com</a>) offers flights from Gatwick to Palermo from £31 one-way.

(Unidentified Floating Object) has two half-spherical shells as passenger compartments, which are divided by a floating disc that can even be used as a cycling path. Guests can relax in a lounge on the upper deck or retreat to the lower sphere to admire the view beneath the surface or have a shower.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Going on holiday is supposed to give adults the chance to recharge the batteries away from the workplace. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">But the advent of smart phones and hotel Wi-Fi means that it is virtually impossible to fully get away form the office these days, with many workers feeling an obligation to field emails and calls from the sun lounger. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">So what are employees' rights when taking their annual leave if the office won't stop calling? Will ignoring the boss get them fired?</font></p><img id="i-6c2a918ccc1b0107" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/30/16/32AC8B4800000578-3515692-image-a-60_1459351053880.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="Employees are finding it harder than ever to switch off while on holiday" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">MailOnline Travel spoke to Andrew Pullman, the Managing Director of HR consultancy People Risk Solutions, about how much a person should be expected to work while on holiday and what to do if the pressure becomes too much. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">According to Pullman, the test for working out whether or not a company is asking too much of their employee during a vacation all comes down to 'Reasonableness'. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">He said: ' As long as an employer behaves reasonably, the reasonable requests should be responded to.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'When does reasonable become unreasonable though - that's the key test.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The degree of reasonableness also depends on what type of job the person in question does and what level of responsibility they have at the company. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For example, a junior worker shouldn't be expected to field as many calls as someone who holds a managerial position. </font></p><img id="i-1480c23a2f7b0453" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/30/16/32AC8B3200000578-3515692-image-a-62_1459351063462.jpg" height="801" width="634" alt="The advent of smart phones means people are contactable wherever they are in the world " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Pullman said: 'If you're a senior manager you might choose to go away and not be bothered, but if you are a key part of the business and something comes up and you don't respond, the company could be regarded as having reasonably acted where you did not.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Whereas, if you are more junior and less critical to the operation and want to go on holiday, then get bombarded, it depends on what it is about and if it is necessary to have your input.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'The larger the organisation, the easier it is to switch off too, because you're a small cog in a big business. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'But you should question whether it is unreasonable to expect something should wait until you come back. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Obviously, the idea that you are away, that means you should have a holiday and most companies do adhere to that, but there should be a reasonable expectation that someone might get in contact.' </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">While employees shouldn't be expected to work while they go away, Pullman believes that there are plenty of situations that would call for a person to put in some hours during their break. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The trick is working out how badly your assistance is needed, or if someone else could do the job equally well. </font></p><img id="i-2862a6e15b6ab4c5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/30/16/32AC8B5200000578-3515692-image-a-63_1459351142175.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="It's importance to find balance while on holiday and not end up chained to your inbox " class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-9ccc213b9805bcf2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/30/16/32AC921500000578-3515692-image-m-66_1459351261977.jpg" height="641" width="306" alt="Employees and bosses both need to learn to be flexible when it comes to working on holiday " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He said: 'If something crops up, question how urgent it is when deciding whether or not you respond, what your obligations are as an employee under your contract and then look at the principle of reasonableness.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Question if you are the only person available. Because if they have an issue back at the office where someone is under a bus and another is in an uncontactable situation, then it is only fair and sensible to help.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">'And it also depends on what the requests are - if they are normal day to day things that aren’t vital, you are within your rights to say I'll deal with it when I get back.'</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">In the extreme situation where a person was asked to return from holiday early for work, Pullman believes that there are very few valid reasons. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">He said: 'It would have to be a fairly critical situation where a large chunk of business might be lost, the business is in trouble or absolutely no one else can deal with it.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'And that person would have to be recompensed in some way, providing them with another holiday at the least.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'If an employer randomly summons people back for being bloody minded, that suggests they might not be someone you want to work for.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If the situation becomes untenable and your employer is refusing to allow for vacation downtime, Pullman says drastic consequences might have to be taken. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He said: 'Then you have to question if you want to stay in that kind of work situation. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'The market is picking up now and there are more jobs out there, so employers have to treat someone more reasonably or the employee can go elsewhere.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Slavery went out in the 19th century, you don’t have to work where you work - you have employment rights.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If an employee did decide to simply ignore any calls and emails from the office, the consequences would depend on any guidelines the company has for such instances. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Lynn Taylor, a national workplace expert told <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.inc.com/business-insider/are-employees-legally-required-to-be-reachable-on-vacation.html?cid=sf01001&amp;sr_share=twitter">inc.com</a>: 'It would be surprising if [a] manager had a legal case against an employee who was taking a paid holiday vacation,</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'But this is a classic case where having a solid company policy pays off, at the very least, it points to the value of communicating mutual expectations between a manager and a team.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">According to Taylor, without any clear guidelines, the situation would most likely land in the favour of the employee.  </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Employees find it harder than ever to switch off on holiday, but how much can a person expect to leave work behind?

                            </h3>
                            <div class="ins cleared xolcc bdrcc"><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">1. Never keep your wallet or valuables in your rear pocket, even if it buttons - it's by far the easiest target.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">2. Beware of the distraction tactic. Dropping something near you, squirting something on you, or simply jostling you. Be on guard when in crowds, and secure your belongings.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">3. Pickpockets often work in pairs or groups and it's not just the usual suspects. Be cautious with any strangers – sometimes people who don't look like they'd be a threat, such as children or the elderly, can be part of larger operations.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">4. Stay alert in confined spaces and near passageways. Try to avoid standing near the doorways of trains as groups of pickpockets can rush at you when the doors open.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">5. Before you set off on a trip, pare down the contents of your purse or wallet as the smaller the bulge, the less likely pickpockets are to covet it. </font></p>
