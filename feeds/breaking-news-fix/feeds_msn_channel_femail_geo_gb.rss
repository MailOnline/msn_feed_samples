Minutes earlier she’d told me she’d never had an orgasm before so over the following 45 minutes I helped her climax for the first time ever. It was an amazing moment for the both of us – but it was also my job to make sure she left happy, as I was a male escort.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eight years ago I was working in London as a software engineer and enjoyed it a lot. As someone who’s always been sexually adventurous in the bedroom and keen to try new things when I hit my thirties I began to go to workshops in my spare time, to learn about things such as Tantra and bondage – anything that would add a bit more spice in the bedroom.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But then eight years ago I ended up organising a sex workshop in London for my favourite sex book author. I wrote to him and asked if I could pay him to teach. After that I went to Prague to hold a workshop myself and a woman at the workshop offered to pay me £130 for a private session. I was surprised and delighted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She admitted to me that she’d always felt quite shy when it came to sex and wanted me to give her an erotic massage – Something she’d never dared ask a partner for.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I felt very confident that I could give her exactly what she wanted. We did it in back room of the studio. When it was over, I felt so elated that I had managed to satisfy her and make her climax, I knew I could make a living out of it.</p><img id="i-1ceb90da1f59bbce" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/08/4D2678DF00000578-5833793-image-a-9_1528788515137.jpg" height="324" width="634" alt="After teaching his first workshop a female student offered to pay him £130 for a private session - Seani says he helped her to climax for the first time " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I did wonder how I would tell people what I was doing and I decided to keep it from my father. At first I kept working as a software engineer, while organising my own sex workshops in London and in my native Australia and offering my services as an escort.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These could be a ‘hands off experience' which is just chatting, or a ‘kinky boyfriend’ experience where I combine kink with intimacy such as spanking or role play or just sensual touch, sex and erotic play.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I advertised on Facebook and other websites charging from £90 an hour to £1,200 for a full day or overnight. I strictly never take my pants off in the first session so that my clients feel safe and are reassured it is all about their needs not mine. I just meet and greet them and give a massage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I never confessed to any of my engineer colleagues about my secret side job, but as my reputation grew over the next four years, I was able to give up my office job in June 2015 and work full time in the sex industry.</p><img id="i-bd8e0fa403a839ca" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/08/4D2678D500000578-5833793-image-a-10_1528788608578.jpg" height="535" width="634" alt="It initially started as Seani's 'secret side job', but soon became his full time career.

Many had experienced a string of bad relationships and want to explore sex for themselves, while others were pretty high powered women who want to surrender to their sexuality and be more submissive. I even had one famous client who appeared on TV regularly!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lots of my clients have also never climaxed before they’d been with me, which I felt was just so sad, as it’s such a natural and wonderful thing. But one of them ended up having really noisy orgasms once she discovered them, which was very funny. I meet clients at home and I remember once she practically screamed my house down while we were having sex.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When she left, my neighbours, who have no idea what I do, gave me some really funny looks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2015 I met my current partner at a Tantric sex workshop. From the start I was very open about my work with her and thankfully she’s always been very positive and encouraging. I imagine it’s because she’s also interested in exploring sex and can see that I’m helping empower women and their sexuality. She knows I practice safe sex and always use a condom.</p><img id="i-34013e7f7d4cacc0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/08/4D26789400000578-5833793-image-a-11_1528788641412.jpg" height="634" width="634" alt="The escort met his current partner at a Tantric sex workshop, and says that while she occasionally feels insecure, she is supportive of his work in the sex industry  " class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-fcad0c443a37f112" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/08/4D2685B900000578-5833793-image-a-12_1528788700577.jpg" height="1127" width="634" alt="Seani says his sessions are all about what his client needs and wants to explore " class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-85251d9f4cf9092b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/08/4D26859100000578-5833793-image-a-13_1528788726503.jpg" height="634" width="634" alt="'I make it my job to make sure they have the best possible sexual experience when they're with me,' Seani says of his clients - mostly women in their 30s and 40s " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the moment we live in different cities as she is from the Netherlands and we have a long distance love.

I am always open in conversation and while some men tell me it’s their dream job, others have accused me of lying, as I don't fit the stereotype of the buff, hairless, Chippendale type male. And I often get asked why a woman would pay for sex with me when they can just pick someone up at a bar.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have slept with around 1,000 women since I began and the truth is that if a woman is paying then the whole time it is about them and their needs and what she wants to explore.

I tried training in gyms by myself and found that I let myself off too easy and wasn't pushing myself enough,' she explained.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Most of the sessions at PLC are a mix of HIIT and weights, with certain days targeting certain areas of the body (i.e. arm day, leg day ect). There are also a few days that are dedicated to slow and controlled heavy weight exercises, as well as boxing and yoga at the end of the week. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I try to train 5-6 days per week, first thing in the morning.

Everyone has those days when we are bloated or we are just simply not feeling ourselves and when you're a model sometimes your job will be to pose in front of a camera wearing bikinis all day, regardless of how you're feeling. </p><img id="i-eabbf1ce2bca9195" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D25374400000578-5832641-image-a-12_1528761262465.jpg" height="757" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-eb1780155a7fd074" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D25375000000578-5832641-image-a-13_1528761265264.jpg" height="670" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When you get a set of photos back and you don't like them or they didn't turn out how you had previous imagined then sometimes that can really take a toll on your confidence. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Also, rejection is another thing that comes with the job.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Photographs seldom say too much, but once in a while they say everything. On Sunday afternoon the cameras clicked on a family relaxing in the sunshine at a polo match.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Naturally, the focus of this carefree sequence were the children, <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/prince_george/index.html" id="mol-76c865b0-6dd0-11e8-b208-a38a25b85f29">Prince George</a>, four, and his three-year-old sister <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/princess_charlotte/index.html" id="mol-76c8b3d0-6dd0-11e8-b208-a38a25b85f29">Princess Charlotte</a>, the royal scene-stealer-in-chief.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For once, George, so often uncomfortable in the public gaze was a picture of playful intent, whether it was swiping a ball with his cut-down polo stick, playing make-believe cowboys or just obediently watching 'papa' <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/prince_william/index.html" id="mol-76c88cc0-6dd0-11e8-b208-a38a25b85f29">Prince William</a> on horseback.</p><img id="i-4e5830c726744afb" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D24529500000578-5832775-image-a-9_1528760159376.jpg" height="640" width="634" alt="Is this, then, a snapshot of the real Kate, the way she sees herself, a royal duchess and a Middleton?" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="moduleFull"></div><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But while the young Prince and his sister with her skipping and somersaults are certainly charming, the stand-out element of this tableau of family happiness is surely the children's mother.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sitting bare-legged on the ground with sunglasses casually propped up on her head, they are the most extraordinary pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge. Extraordinary, because the way a woman looks usually reflects the way she feels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And there can be no doubt that judging from her smiling informality, Kate is feeling wonderful.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now there is surely something unexpected about this. It is, after all, only seven weeks since the birth of her third child, Prince Louis, and if the experience of her first-born children is anything to go by, the early weeks of baby No 3 have been tough.</p><img id="i-84a6c15214d1f187" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D24528900000578-5832775-image-a-13_1528760224777.jpg" height="812" width="634" alt="There was surprise that Meghan chose the off-the-shoulder look again on Saturday" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">George cried and was difficult to feed, and while Charlotte was perfect in comparison, her arrival left Kate exhausted, even irritable. With all three pregnancies she suffered from extreme morning sickness, so who could blame her if she wanted to retreat from the spotlight a little bit longer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But look closely at the pictures and at the joie de vivre that shines out. No sign of resentment at being photographed — something she has displayed in the past — no suggestion of self-pity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, there is a radiance that says: 'Here I am, the happiest woman in the world.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Is this, then, a snapshot of the real Kate, the way she sees herself, a royal duchess and a Middleton? And if so, why now? The answer lies in part with another set of pictures. These were taken 24 hours earlier, of the Buckingham Palace balcony for the Queen's official birthday celebrations, Trooping the Colour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In these, the slim Duchess in a hat that seemed to elevate her height, stands in the front row next to her father-in-law Prince Charles, towering over him. She is looking completely at ease.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Behind her is the Duchess of Sussex, slimmer — and shorter — but in a dusty pink outfit that highlighted the honeymoon glow of her shoulders.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The two women, relatives by marriage and neighbours at Kensington Palace are the pin-ups of the Royal Family, both epitomes of style and whose every outfit provokes a sales rush.</p><img id="i-8414295d99786718" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D1C8F6C00000578-5832775-Look_at_me_Three_year_old_Charlotte_impressed_Kate_as_she_showed-a-11_1528760175139.jpg" height="506" width="632" alt="Look at me! Three-year-old Charlotte impressed Kate as she showed off her gymnastic skills with a handstand - leaving her mother in fits of giggles" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Harry and Meghan gave their post-engagement interview, the prince spoke of the challenge the actress set. As he recalled, he told himself: 'I am really going to have to up my game here.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harry, it seems, has not been the only one to up their game — in palace corridors they are saying that so, too, has the Duchess of Cambridge. Just take her clothes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The casual dress she wore for the family visit to Beaufort Polo Club on Sunday that displayed her open neck owed much to the 'bateau'-style Meghan chose, not just for her wedding dress but also at Trooping. There is no doubt the couture chic of Meghan has drawn comparisons with Kate's more High Street look. In fact, the dress sense of both women is highly prized — but are they rivals?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Courtiers believe there could be a nuanced message here. As elegant and chic as Kate looked, her £39.99 Zara dress will be much more affordable to the average British woman than Meghan's high-end fashion choices.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was surprise that Meghan chose the off-the-shoulder look again on Saturday. 'She looked like she was going to a cocktail party rather than the formality of the Queen's birthday parade,' says a former palace official.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's a difficult act to pull off, and these are early days, but maybe she's trying to be a little too cutting edge. In her early days, Kate had to be subtly told not to show so much leg, so it can happen to anyone.'</p><img id="i-8d52b55bebd026f9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D1D606400000578-5832775-The_young_royal_was_seen_pretending_to_shoot_the_plastic_firearm-a-25_1528761338191.jpg" height="451" width="631" alt="The young royal was seen pretending to shoot the plastic firearm at other children and even his mother, the Duchess of Cambridge" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many at the Palace have warmed to the arrival of the American for just those reasons, of course. Kate can come across as stiff and rather formal alongside the more spontaneous and articulate Meghan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are not the first royal sisters-in-law to face critical attention. Thirty years ago, Princess Diana and the Duchess of York see-sawed between kinship and rivalry. At first, the two were friends: Diana, remember, more or less introduced Sarah Ferguson into Prince Andrew's life and after the Yorks' wedding they became close friends.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But after five years of Diana, the public were bound to be intrigued by the new arrival. And they weren't alone. Charles famously once reproached his wife, saying: 'Why can't you be more like Fergie?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The criticism stuck and Diana told photographers: 'You don't need me, you've got Fergie now.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By the time of their separations they were reconciled, only to fall out again when Fergie brought out her memoirs. But this time there was no making up and Diana was dead before there could be a rapprochement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kate, of course is not Diana, though Sunday's visit to the polo field is so reminiscent of the Princess's own weekend visits with Harry and William to watch Prince Charles play in the Eighties and early Nineties.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And any comparison between the Duchess of Sussex and Fergie, starts and ends with the fact that Meghan, too, married a younger royal prince, who also happened to be in the armed services.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, her adjustment to royal life is taking time. Insiders say she was 'very nervous' on her first appearance on the Palace balcony and Harry was a reassuring presence at her side.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Both Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have recognised that such is the scale of the change in her life from screen star to working duchess that she will need extra time to adapt.</p><img id="i-7bec262445bd70c6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D22D7E600000578-5832775-Young_royal_Prince_George_was_seen_pretending_to_shoot_the_plast-a-12_1528760187710.jpg" height="586" width="632" alt="Young royal Prince George was seen pretending to shoot the plastic firearm at other children" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They are trying to keep things light to ensure she doesn't get overwhelmed by the idea of duty,' says a friend of the Prince. 'There are protocols to observe, but they are saying that things can be done differently and no one will really raise too much of an eyebrow.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kate can be key to this. As an outsider, she knows the royal ropes, but the two women are not obvious allies. What binds them is the love and affection they have for Harry and their shared lives at Kensington Palace.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is one area where Meghan cannot compete with Kate — children. Harry yearns to become a father and the sight of George and Charlotte playing in the sunshine also carried a powerful message.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For Kate was showing that, as a member of the Royal Family, being a mother is the most important thing of all. So it may be that rather than Kate copying Meghan, Meghan will want to copy Kate. </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Is this, then, a snapshot of the real Kate (left and right), the way she sees herself, a royal duchess and a Middleton?

Several weeks later, she found herself sitting in a coffee shop, counting down the minutes until she could make her excuses and go home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another bad dating story? Not so.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thirty-one-year-old Hazel, an attractive and successful fitness instructor from Lancashire, wasn't looking for love — she was very happy with her boyfriend of a year: she was looking for friends.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She didn't have any (not close ones anyway), and as that awkward meet-up with other women in a similar situation proved, the social skills needed to set other women at ease, and relax and enjoy their company, just weren't there. And this, she is convinced, is a legacy of growing up an only child.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'My parents separated when I was four and Mum and I have been a little unit ever since,' says Hazel, who only last year moved out of her 56-year-old mother Shirley's home. 'We've done everything together, from losing weight to venturing into dating, and I wouldn't change our relationship for anything.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But the older I get, the more conscious I am that I would love to have female friends my own age.

After her father died in 2005, she spent the next decade caring for her mother, who was diagnosed with early onset dementia.

Then, after eight years of looking after her, making the decision to put her into a care home almost broke me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'My friends were wonderful, telling me that it was absolutely the right — and safest — thing for Mum, and that her illness was so advanced that she wasn't aware of what was happening. Then, when she died in 2015, I struggled to cope with my grief. There was no brother or sister to share it with, someone who felt the same way about Mum as I did. When my daughter turned 13 recently, she asked me what I'd done on my 13th birthday.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">With 23 school shootings in the US since 2018 began — amounting to one shooting per week so far this year — the news that another school is on lockdown with an active shooter has become incredibly and devastatingly commonplace.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And many parents are heartbroken and horrified that that's the case, including <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/news/california/index.html">Los Angeles </a>mom Sarah Wine-Thyre, 49.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last week, when the school that her 12-year-old daughter went into lockdown, Wine-Thyre decided to spotlight the sad new reality by tweeting her daughter's take on the whole thing.</p><img id="i-655dd40537e91bcc" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/21/4D0F159E00000578-5822563-image-a-45_1528491361930.jpg" height="319" width="634" alt="Talking on Twitter: Los Angeles mother Sarah Wine-Thyre's tweets about her daughter's school have gone viral" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-961d07b3da0596df" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/21/4D0F156600000578-5822563-image-a-47_1528491385248.jpg" height="347" width="634" alt="Scary stuff: Her 12-year-old shared what it was like the day her school went into lockdown because of an intruder" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-d27e0668aa664a7c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/21/4D0F156E00000578-5822563-image-a-46_1528491378188.jpg" height="252" width="634" alt="Horrible: Her tween daughter said everyone was crying hand holding each other, and she and her best friend tried to keep themselves happy" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This afternoon, I received text alerts from my kids' school that they were on lockdown,' she wrote on Wednesday, June 6, later explaining that there was an 'unidentified intruder on campus.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I thought you might like to know what happens, from the perspective of my 12yo.

I said just in case we die, let's remember all our good times. My [best friend] and I sang our favorite song to each other.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wine-Thyre added that she could see how distraught the kids were when she went to pick her daughter up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'All the kids in the class were visibly shaken and giddy.

THAT was even scarier.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There was one spot where the blinds weren't down all the way and we kept staring at it expecting some man's face to look in and see us and come in and kill us.

It's appalling that we do this to kids,' she added. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the ordeal, Wine-Thyre said she emailed her daughter's teacher to thank them, but even knowing her kid was safe didn't calm her down. </p><img id="i-28a0720ed51ee18b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/22/4D0F0DED00000578-5822563-image-a-63_1528492320177.jpg" height="501" width="634" alt="Appreciative: Wine-Thyre felt like she was 'gonna throw up' after and emailed the girl's teachers to thank them" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-7d21e6d5fd56084b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/22/4D0F0DF500000578-5822563-image-a-65_1528492330549.jpg" height="137" width="634" alt="Her kid: She was just as worked up as her daughter, if not more so" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-e3a4e70e8169bb9a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/22/4D0F0DF100000578-5822563-image-a-64_1528492326190.jpg" height="252" width="634" alt="Change: She said they felt a real difference between a drill and the real thing" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I still kinda feel like I'm gonna throw up.

Lockdown drills and active shooter drills are coming from within, with no warning. There is a difference.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She went on: 'It's manufactured crisis, not an act of god. Almost completely avoidable with common sense laws.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The teachers in my family are constantly ruminating about how they will/would react in a school shooting situation, while they wonder about their own children's safety and lives.

The school was put on lockdown because of an intruder, but students weren't told what was happening and had to remain quiet and hidden. Wine-Thyre said after school, the class was still 'visibly shaken and giddy' and holding each other.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHAT TO DO </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you sit down for long hours a day, try this exercise to stretch out your hip flexor muscles and improve posture, says personal trainer, Nadya Fairweather (u-shape.co.uk).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sit on a bench or chair with no arms. Sit the left half of your bottom on the chair and drop the right off. Reach the right foot behind and push your hip forwards until you feel a stretch. Hold for 10-30 seconds. Repeat on the other leg. Aim for four reps on each side. Slow the breathing and relax into the stretch.</p><img id="i-6d74db2acf9a1024" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/01/4D1D8B6700000578-0-image-a-14_1528677620682.jpg" height="634" width="634" alt="Nadya Fairweather says that if you sit down for long hours a day, try this exercise to stretch out your hip flexor muscles and improve posture" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHAT TO EAT </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For strong, yet flexible hips, your diet is key, says nutritionist Shona Wilkinson (shonawilkinson.com).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Flaxseeds are a rich source of Omega 3 essential fatty acids. These help to reduce inflammation in the hips, with the added benefit of keeping skin healthy. Add to soups, casseroles or smoothies.</p><img id="i-56314fd87ea1301" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/01/4D1D8A9A00000578-0-image-a-15_1528677626487.jpg" height="448" width="634" alt="To help with the workout, eat cabbagem which contains sulforaphane, which has been shown to help slow down any cartilage damage" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cabbage contains sulforaphane, which has been shown to help slow down any cartilage damage.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Are you happy? It’s an impossible question, according to one scientist, who has made a global study of the words that define our upbeat moods.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The trouble with “happiness” is not that it means nothing, but that it means too much,’ says Dr Tim Lomas, whose vigorous attempts to be happy have ranged from singing in a ska band to teaching English in <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-907dd180-6d0c-11e8-82d4-958d28e2303e">China</a>. ‘We use the word to cover a host of positive feelings, from trivial hedonic sensations to our most profound experiences.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The solution, he believes, is to categorise and define the different ways of being happy. And to do that, we need more words than English alone can supply.</p><img id="i-81861d89dd2003b1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/01/4D1F447700000578-0-image-a-22_1528675616919.jpg" height="623" width="634" alt="Dr Tim Lomas, a lecturer at the University of East London, scoured the world to compile a Happiness Dictionary " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Lomas, a lecturer at the University of East London, has scoured the world to compile a Happiness Dictionary, listing more than 100 terms from A to Z — from the easiest to enjoy (abbiocco, Italian for ‘that pleasant drowsy feeling that follows a good meal’) to the most challenging (zanshin, the Japanese art of remaining relaxed yet alert in the face of danger).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here are some to inspire you, not only to feel happier, but to be able to give that feeling a name, because somewhere in the world there’s a word for it . . .</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Fika</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a more civilised era, the English were famous for taking a tea break at four o’clock. The Swedes must be twice as civilised because they down tools and pick up a coffee mug twice a day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mid-morning and mid-afternoon, they leave their screens and workbenches to share the communal coffee break or fika. These get-togethers are not impromptu, but happen with Swedish efficiency, on schedule, at 10am and 3pm. Managers encourage the practice, since it helps staff to get to know each other.</p><img id="i-2ccfd44b9ae8bdd0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/01/4D1F1C9300000578-0-image-m-26_1528675943711.jpg" height="441" width="634" alt="The scientist said it was impossible to explain if you were happy in the English language (file photo)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Kefi</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Greeks have a tradition of hedonistic celebration and debauchery dating back thousands of years to the cult of the ancient god of wine, Dionysius. Worshippers would drink and dance themselves into an ecstatic frenzy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is the spirit of kefi and it still imbues Grecian revelries, especially when the sun goes down on another blissfully hot Mediterranean day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are versions of kefi all over the world. In Africa, it’s known by the Swahili verb mbuki-mvuki, which means to shed your clothes in drunken abandon while dancing. Such delirious happiness comes at a cost, though, not least a thumping headache in the morning.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Kintsugi</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the Zen tradition, broken crockery is not thrown away but repaired, with gold lacquer applied over the cracks, highlighting their unique pattern. This technique, kintsugi, is both beautiful and practical, but it has a deeper purpose: teaching students of Zen to be proud of the scars left by life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A heart that has been broken is more lovely than one that has never known love.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Koi no yokan</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We call it ‘love at first sight’, but the Japanese phrase is even more wonderful. It means ‘an intuitive flash on meeting someone new’, the absolute certainty that this is your soul-mate and love is inevitable.</p><img id="i-53725e6dec2d1982" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/01/4D1F1CCF00000578-0-image-m-27_1528676003075.jpg" height="475" width="634" alt="One word in the English dictionary is Koi no yokan, a Japanese phrase that means ¿an intuitive flash on meeting someone new¿ (file photo)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps this is why in English we talk about ‘falling’ in love — it’s as irresistible as gravity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Strangely, there is an almost identical word in Greek: koinonia, meaning ‘an instant connection with someone’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It might be a colleague, a neighbour or a stranger: with a word or a glance, you suddenly sense that you’re on the same wavelength.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Morgenfrisk</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even the sound of this word makes you feel good. It’s Danish, and it literally means ‘morning-fresh’ — the joyous sensation of waking after a great night’s sleep, with sunlight streaming through the windows and birds singing. In our frenetic lives, when we are often expected to be on-call day and night, we often skimp on sleep.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’d be far happier if we enjoyed a good night’s sleep and awoke morgenfrisk. That’s probably easier in the fjords than on a wet Wednesday in Dudley.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Mudita</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The surest way to spread happiness is to share a smile. Goodwill is infectious. And, according to the teachings of Buddhism, one of the most satisfying emotions is the wellbeing we feel when we are happy at the good fortune of others. Mudita is the opposite of bitterness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An obvious example is the vicarious joy we feel at seeing someone else’s wedding. Cultivate mudita and it’s possible to share anyone’s happiness, even that of a workmate who has won the promotion you wanted for yourself.</p><img id="i-263132bfbceb89bd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/01/4D1F1CAF00000578-5828083-image-m-28_1528676073674.jpg" height="432" width="634" alt="Another word is Morgenfrisk, Danish, and it literally means ¿morning-fresh¿ ¿ the joyous sensation of waking after a great night¿s sleep" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mudita is a difficult emotion to fake. We’ve all seen that tense, brittle smirk which says: ‘I’m pretending to be pleased, but actually I want to kill you.’ There ought to be a word for this too: murdita.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Turangawaewae</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sometimes the hardest words to say are the easiest to grasp. Turangawaewae is a Maori concept from New Zealand, which literally translates as ‘a place to stand’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It conjures up the sense of contentment that comes with knowing your place: a piece of land, a home to call your own and a position in your community.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another tongue-twister is umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu, a Zulu phrase usually contracted to ubuntu. It means ‘a person is a person through other people’, or, as Archbishop Desmond Tutu once explained it: ‘I am human because I belong.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Utepils</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pils, as any beer-drinker knows, is the universal word for lager. Ask a Scot the meaning of ute, pronounced ‘oot’, and it’s obviously ‘out’. So Norwegian word utepils is a lager enjoyed outdoors — in the sun, in a beer garden or at a barbecue. Happiness can be liquid, after all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Vidunder</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Real happiness is found in the ordinary and the everyday. But to fully appreciate our daily lives, we must experience something truly extraordinary — what the Swedes call vidunder.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It can be a natural phenomenon, such as a mountain range, a work of art or the lyrical emotion from music. Whatever the cause, vidunder is the awestruck sensation that life is greater than we comprehend.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">The Happiness Dictionary by Dr Tim Lomas (Piatkus Books, £14.99).

She says the look is inspired by a Seventies love affair with fashion and crochet has been embraced by designers.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Crochet. I know what you are thinking: ‘Granny quilting squares, baby booties … nothing to see here … Next please!’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And truly, I hear you. As a fashion trend, crochet has always struck me as a conundrum. It’s either impossibly sexy (see Heather Graham in bombshell mode, donning a pink and red crochet mini as Felicity Shagwell in Austin Powers); or downright frumpy (think lumpy tunics that make you look like you’ve dressed up in a doily). Tricky.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But as fashion continues its Seventies love affair, crochet is popping up everywhere, from quirky sky-high heels at Zara (£79.99, zara.com), to beaded tank tops at Topshop (£25, topshop.com), so it’s worth making friends with the trend.</p><img id="i-292f138f77ba35b2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/23/4D1D511100000578-5827855-image-a-27_1528670517147.jpg" height="953" width="634" alt="British fashion expert Sarah Bailey talks about the new Seventies-inspired trend that is sweeping designers - crochet" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the autumn/winter 2018 catwalks, designers continued to favour crochet for next season, too. It was embraced at Christian Dior; creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri showed a knee-length ‘sweater’ dress in ombre shades of mulberry and midnight (my dream buy), plus more ‘Felicity Shagwell’ cobwebby numbers that should only be attempted over a roll neck and knee-high boots.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But how to get in on the free-spirited crochet movement for summer without looking like an accident in a Hobbycraft warehouse?</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Strong colours look more modern. I love the cap-sleeved, striped top in Alexa Chung’s latest collection (now £117, net-a-porter.com): perfect paired with raw-hemmed white jeans or, if you are lucky enough to be blessed with Alexa’s legs, shorts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Zara has a great striped tank top in a similar vein (£19.99, zara.com) and a chevron-striped wide-sleeved sweater (£39.99, zara.com). It’s the touch of black in these knits that keeps the look sharp.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The combination of pastel hues and crochet tends to fill me with dread, conjuring nightmarish retro visions of antimacassars and bed jackets. If you are going to invest in something pale and crocheted, go the whole hog in a romantic, maxi-length floor-sweeper.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are some fabulous, big-event dresses with intricate crochet frills, in summery off-white shades — Australian label Zimmermann does this look well. Holidays provide the perfect chance to experiment. And while I won’t be wearing Zimmermann’s crochet bikini (£80, uk.zimmermannwear.com), if you look good in triangular bra tops, be my guest.</p><img id="i-3859c8efd78bb03" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/23/4D1D511900000578-5827855-image-m-30_1528670798256.jpg" height="1441" width="634" alt="She praised Amal Clooney (pictured) for pulling off a look which many consider to be difficult and a conundrum" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avoid straying into Seventies costume territory by keeping accessories pared back and sticking to just one crochet piece in your outfit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Accessories provide the easiest way to play with the trend. Check out Mira Mikati’s rainbow crochet sliders (£295, net-a-porter.com) for a feel-good vacation shoe. Crochet bobble earrings from J Crew (now £33, jcrew.com) provide a nice, witty, Carmen Miranda touch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And leave it to Anya Hindmarch, the cleverest lady in fashion, to come up with a detachable crochet ‘guitar strap’ for your handbag (£195, anyahindmarch.com).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, the Seventies revival extends beyond fashion. There’s renewed interest in sustainability and solutions to wean us off plastics and other environmental nasties, so it makes sense that people have an appetite for craft and natural materials again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, I have it on reliable authority that rope, knotted bags are going to be big news for autumn/winter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I know what you’re thinking: ‘She’s going to be telling us about macrame and knot-your-own jute pot holders next’. Well, seeing as you mention it, there’s a bag at Mango with a string macrame shoulder strap (£49.99, mango.com), but you’ll have to wait for another week for that trend!</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>British fashion expert Sarah Bailey says that crochet is the new trend.

I’ve already tried a couple of times and bottled out. A part of me fears that maybe he just doesn’t find me attractive anymore. How can I make things right?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>STEPH SAYS</strong>: The problem here isn’t just that you haven’t had sex for seven years, it’s that you haven’t talked about not having sex — for seven years! How does that happen? Do you ever actually speak to each other? It’s quite a breathtaking lack of communication. And it speaks volumes about your marriage.</p><img id="i-6bfae2fba92f3db3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/23/4D1EFB0C00000578-5827829-image-a-51_1528670689044.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="A woman in her 60s asks Steph and Dom for help on approaching her husband about the fact they haven't had sex in seven years (file photo)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The other thing that worries me here is that this seems rather one-sided. You had a difficult menopause — and I sympathise with you on that — but now you’re through the other side, you’re worried he doesn’t fancy you any more!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What about your poor husband? Where is your concern for his feelings in all of this? This is all a bit too ‘me, me, me’ for my liking.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You’re feeling rejected now when you didn’t before. I wonder, why now? Has your husband’s behaviour changed towards you in any way? Is there something else going on here? Have you started to worry, rather belatedly, it has to be said, that he may be going elsewhere for sex?</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I think you do need to bring it up with him, but be prepared to hear something you might not like.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You say you’re happily married, aside from the lack of sex, but I’m sorry to say I don’t find that reassuring. If anything is likely to start rows, it’s a problem in the bedroom. Many people are happy in companion marriages, but it generally does signify a cooling of the warmth of love.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And if your husband is happy with the status quo, and has been for seven years, then that might indicate a lack of libido.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">People don’t talk about it, but a man’s sex drive can decrease with age, too. So, be prepared to accept it if your husband says he’d rather go to bed for a cup of tea and a good book than a good bonk!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You need to give him the opportunity to talk about his feelings and ask him how all of this is making him feel. He hasn’t had a voice in this for a very long time now. It wouldn’t be unreasonable of him to be angry and resentful.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it’s not beyond the bounds of possibility that he has found his own solution to the problem. If that’s the case, you don’t have to shake stuff up just for the sake of it! You can repair most things, but you might need some help. Relate, or another counselling service, could well be helpful.</p><img id="i-cb284390bf5e8e85" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/23/4D1D450900000578-5827829-image-m-41_1528669442083.jpg" height="812" width="634" alt="Steph and Dom (pictured) respond to the question with Steph saying: 'It¿s quite a breathtaking lack of communication'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remember, you can’t go back and you can’t stay put, you can only move forward. I hope you do so hand-in-hand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>DOM SAYS</strong>: Well, I’m delighted to say I think your dilemma is eminently solveable. Seven years is a long time to go without sex but it’s also an interesting amount of time. Many people believe life moves in seven year cycles — the seven year itch and so on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, it’s intriguing you’ve chosen to write in now. Well done for summoning up the courage. You clearly feel ready for change.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The thing is there are two of you in this marriage. It’s not like your husband doesn’t know there’s nothing going on in the bedroom! I’m sure he’s very, very aware of the situation! It must have become a massive elephant in the room between you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the good news is, is can still be addressed — ideally with a simple, jovial conversation. If I were you, I’d pour you both a large glass of wine and just come out with it. Say: ‘Do you remember why we stopped having sex?’ or something like that. It’s important you phrase it as a question — you want to talk to him about it, not start a row.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s very possible that he’ll be a bit taken aback. After all, he’s spent seven years carefully ignoring the topic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He’s probably been treading on eggshells for a long time. The last thing he’s going to want to do is to upset you, so you may find he’s reluctant to talk. Press on, but gently.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You may have hurt him deeply and rejection is a very difficult thing for a man to handle. You need to tell him, clearly, that were he to make an advance towards you now, it would be welcomed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then leave it alone. Tell him, but don’t show him. Who knows, you may provoke an immediate response, but if you don’t, don’t push it. He might need a bit of time to get his courage back up. And you owe him that!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Menopause is a difficult time in the life of every woman, but it’s also a difficult time in the life of every man who loves a menopausal woman. Your husband has been very patient and respectful: he’s sat back and waited, not waltzed off with someone new.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whatever you do, tread gently with this one. Make the first move by opening the conversation, then let him respond when he’s good and ready.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And be subtle. This requires a gentle chat, not a frilly nightie!</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>An anonymous reader asked British television personalities Steph and Dom Parker for their advice on how to approach her husband about having sex for the first time in seven years.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Danny Hussain</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T08:54:38.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Steph &amp; Dom solve your sex, love &amp; life troubles</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T08:54:38.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5825225/Im-proof-youre-NEVER-old-wear-bikini-says-SUSANNAH-CONSTANTINE.html" title="I'm proof you're NEVER too old to wear a bikini, says SUSANNAH CONSTANTINE as she encourages over 50s to forget ageist fashion edicts "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5827485/Beauty-editor-spent-12-000-seven-types-treatment-bottom.html" title="'My bottom cost £12,000 but I still hate it': Over the last 11 years beauty editor Inge has had SEVEN types of treatment to get rid of her saddlebags and cellulite but how many worked?"></link></item><item><title>Their home is filled with 'A&amp;G' monograms, his marriage proposal went on for 28 minutes and they can't stop kissing in public: Inside the gooey world of the oh-so Swoony Clooneys</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5827827/Inside-gooey-world-oh-Swoony-Clooneys.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jun 2018 22:15:18 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5827827</guid><description><![CDATA[He is the smoothie Hollywood star and she is the stunning British human rights lawyer.

I wondered if I would ever get a chance to date her. We were friends for a while and luckily she said yes.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Amal is a big emailer,' Vogue magazine revealed, describing how romance grew, 'and George responded with a clownish gambit, writing her notes, supposed to be from of his dog Einstein, claiming to be trapped in various places and in need of legal rescue.'</p><img id="i-57ebebd91e0afad2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/22/4D1DF53A00000578-0-image-a-45_1528667904207.jpg" height="388" width="634" alt="The tenderest touch: Their public love-in last Thursday" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter George confirmed the story, saying that the dog, a cocker spaniel, claimed he was being held hostage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The dog has since died but is immortalised in a painting which sits on their mantelpiece.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He is 'dressed as a physics professor' and standing in front of a blackboard.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their next meeting was at the Abbey Road studios in London — where George was recording a film soundtrack and invited her along. He had hoped the venue would make him seem cool, and was deflated when Amal said she had just been visiting the Muslim Brotherhood while he was trying to impress her with a 'dumb movie score'.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>'HIS SMILE ALWAYS MAKES ME MELT'</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I met George when I was 35 and starting to become quite resigned to the idea that I was going to be a spinster.' Amal told the American Film Institute on Thursday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Then we met and started hiding out in my London flat and very soon it felt like, no matter what happened, I would never want to be with anyone else. He is the person who has my complete admiration and also the person whose smile makes me melt every time. My love, what I have found with you is the great love I always hoped existed and seeing you with our children Ella and Alexander is the greatest joy in my life.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">George is even more complimentary. He told an interviewer: 'Look, it's good to surround yourself with anybody who is smarter than you, and for me the bar's pretty low anyway. But Amal is way up there. She's brilliant.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Accepting an award at the 2015 Golden Globes, George oozed: 'Amal, whatever alchemy it is that brought us together, I couldn't be more proud to be your husband.'</p><img id="i-a8babc6ff8cb4f70" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/22/4D1DF53E00000578-0-image-a-47_1528667913413.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Cheek to cheek: A mooch in Cannes" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>LOVE OF GIRAFFES SEALED THE DEAL</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A visit to Kenya together in February 2014 sealed their love. 'Amal loves giraffes; they're her favourite animal,' said George. 'She went to this place called Giraffe Manor, where the giraffes stick their heads through the windows and kiss you.' Back in LA, he showed a photo to his actor friend Ben Weiss.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I had a picture of her, looking back, smiling at these giraffes, and I said: 'I think I'm going to ask her to marry me.' And Ben said: 'I think that's a good idea.' '</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For Clooney — previously married to actress Talia Balsam — it was quite a step, having spent decades dating cocktail waitresses, party girls and even a professional wrestler.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He told Vogue: 'If you know anything about my crazy life, you know that I'd pretty much committed to the idea of never marrying again, but I started dating Amal, and I immediately knew that something was very different.'</p><img id="i-6ad560d2fdc885a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/23/4D1DF54200000578-5827827-True_romance_George_kisses_Amal_s_hand_at_a_Disney_party_in_Cali-a-5_1528669388312.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="True romance: George kisses Amal's hand at a Disney party in California" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>HARD TO GET UP AFTER PROPOSING</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One evening in April 2014, George made them both dinner. 'I did pasta of some form, not that impressive. And then over champagne, after dinner, I told her there was a lighter to light the candle in the drawer, and she reached back and pulled out a ring.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And I did all the stuff, got down on my knee and did all the things you're supposed to do,' he told CBS News in 2015.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The reaction was not quite what he expected. 'She's like: 'Holy s**t!' And she just kept staring at the ring, going: 'Oh, my God.' It was 20 minutes of me on my knee, waiting for her to say yes, because she was so shocked.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In another telling, the wait was even longer: 'She just kept saying: 'Oh my God,' and 'Wow' — completely unexpected. Finally I said, 'Listen, I'm 52 and I've been on my knee now for about 28 minutes, so I gotta get an answer out of this or I'm going to throw a hip out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I might not be able to stand back up.'

Guests at their wedding were sent home with an iPod each, loaded with George's playlist, and monogrammed with 'A&amp;G' as were the napkins at the wedding feast.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And just in case they were in danger of forgetting whose wedding they had attended, they also took home a photograph of the happy couple in a silver frame.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the wedding, Amal presented George with some cufflinks with the word 'George' written on them in Arabic. At their UK home in Sonning, Berkshire, there is a sculpture which features the initials A and G intertwined.</p><img id="i-dc6075888b22036e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/23/4D09F72100000578-0-Amal_Clooney_speaks_a_the_Life_Achievement_Award_Gala_Tribute_to-a-50_1528668056390.jpg" height="456" width="634" alt="Amal Clooney speaks a the  Life Achievement Award Gala Tribute to her husband George" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>HE CALLS TWINS 'KNUCKLEHEADS'</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Quality time with their twins Ella and Alexander is spent between 6am and 8am when they join the couple in bed. Amal says that she doesn't arrange any phone calls until later in the morning so all four of them can be together as a family without any interruption.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is a team of staff who look after them: a nanny, a chef, an assistant and other household staffers. George calls the twins 'the knuckleheads'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Amal said on Thursday night that, having come late to fatherhood, he is a wonderful dad. She said: 'You fill our home with laughter and that's even before the children have worked out that 'Da-da' is Batman, a talking fox and friends with Mary Poppins. I'm so proud of you, my love.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>HER FASHION IS 'CRAZY AND FUN'</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Amal was quite a clothes horse before she and George were married, but has evolved into a fashion icon and is often seen in terrifyingly expensive couture.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not everyone is a fan of some of her more out-there choices. Last month she stepped out in New York wearing a pair of £1,500 Alexander Wang trousers, made to look like frayed denim hotpants worn over leather leggings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even when riding with George on his motorbike in Los Angeles, she puts on Stella McCartney wedges. George said: 'It's amazing, because she's always, since the day I met her, had this insanely . . . it's eccentric but it's fun, sense of fashion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'How she does it while she's got 11 cases she's working on, and she was teaching at Columbia, and she's still like: 'I want to wear that dress.'

George said: 'You can tell the ones that are from 3am, with people in bathrobes.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Confession: I feel bad about my thighs. I know that’s the wrong thing to say in this age of politically correct body positivity, and that I should rock my cellulite with womanly pride.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, I wear long, baggy shorts on the beach (a genius idea, I think; my husband thinks not). Pre-shorts, I’d refuse to get up from my towel for fear of appalling strangers with my lumps.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As Inspire’s anti-ageing columnist and Cosmopolitan’s beauty director, I know all too well that cellulite is just how women store fat and that we’re particularly prone to it in midlife, but that doesn’t stop me hating it.</p><img id="i-5000beed12ca7b71" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/22/4D1E284400000578-5827485-Beauty_editor_Inge_Van_Lotringen_admits_that_she_feels_bad_about-a-36_1528666760968.jpg" height="673" width="634" alt="Beauty editor Inge Van Lotringen admits that she 'feels bad' about her thighs despite several treatments" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was 17 when I began to develop fat pads on my outer thighs and dimples in my bottom, so to me it’s been an eyesore for a very long time. It makes me a target for the ‘body-perfecting’ industry that’s now worth £500 million worldwide. And with all my insider knowledge, I’ve tried almost everything on the market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Does anything work? Well, yes — but it’s a qualified yes. At 48, I’ve finally come to terms with the fact that ‘transformative’ changes don’t happen.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Suffice to say that after 20 years of access to every leg and bottom treatment going, plus a hardcore exercise regime — five hours a week of running, weights and yoga for 25 years — I have a six-pack and Terminator arms. But I still have doughy legs and lumps in my bottom. That’s just how Mother Nature rolls.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, improvements are definitely possible. I may still be in shorts on the beach, but my back view is better than it would be if I hadn’t had any treatments at all. The key is picking very, very carefully.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The non-surgical body-contouring industry remains a bastion of misinformation, using biologically impossible terms such as ‘fat-melting’ and ‘cellulite-removing’ with impunity. But rather than delude yourself that an airbrushed-perfect bottom is achievable with just a few light credit card transfers, wouldn’t you prefer a realistic assessment of what to expect? Clearly, some of us wouldn’t.</p><img id="i-2b32d7c8a1c48975" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/22/4D1EAF8F00000578-5827485-image-a-35_1528666753160.jpg" height="848" width="634" alt="She says that at the age of 48 she has finally realised that it is impossible to completely transform her body (file photo)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Benji Dhillon, of London’s Phi Clinic, says plenty of patients think the one thing standing between them and perfection is cash. ‘A good clinician ought to be searingly honest,’ he says. ‘It’s our responsibility to explain that every individual body or skin reacts differently to treatment. You can’t expect a cookie-cutter result.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can’t expect even a guaranteed result. That means taking a punt on procedures that can cost many thousands of pounds. Which is why finding a clinic that offers multiple treatment options and a 100 per cent up-front consultation is very important.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Or you could rely on the experience of someone who’s tried almost all of it in their professional capacity as a beauty editor (rather than as a fee-paying client): me . . .</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>THE HI-FI SLIMMER</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Multipolar radiofrequency was the first treatment I tried, back in 2007. Like something out of a Fifties UFO movie, a panel emitting high-frequency radiowaves heats fat cells underneath the skin. This makes (some) cell walls disintegrate and release their fatty acid content into the bloodstream, after which the liver gets shot of it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The intended result is fewer and/or shrunken fat cells, leading to smaller saddlebags and a reduction of tummy rolls and bingo wings.</p><img id="i-abc44dd4e81107b5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/22/4D1DEB9C00000578-5827485-image-m-37_1528666805986.jpg" height="637" width="634" alt="The editor admitted that she had spent £12,000 on seven different types of treatment to try and improve her thighs" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s normal for the treatment to feel warm or a bit hot, but not painful. In the wrong hands and with the wrong machine, skin can get burnt. Two colleagues sustained nasty blisters after settings were racked up to ‘super hot’ and the treatment paddle wasn’t moved around continuously, as it should be.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This technology has been around for years and quality varies depending on the age and brand of the machine, so it’s worth asking.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>expert view:</strong> ‘This can cause a level of fat-cell death, but it’s only minimal,’ says Dr Dhillon. ‘You also get a little skin-tightening, which would slightly smooth lumpy skin and is probably what patients most notice. But overall, results are inconsistent.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The make of machine matters: one called Venus Legacy is probably the gold standard. But, says medical aesthetician Renee Lapino, you need six to eight weekly treatments (about £1,350 in total) to lose centimetres — which even Renee, a Venus proponent, admits will last you only ‘months’ without top-ups.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><strong>MY VERDICT</strong><strong></strong><strong>:</strong> I’ve had this treatment three times over the years, the first one 11 years ago with results so minimal as to be invisible (although I admit I haven’t tried the Venus Legacy). The technology could work if you had it every week for the rest of your life. But I’m no oligarch-who-lunches.</p><img id="i-37818c5d574f6552" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/22/4D1EA0A700000578-5827485-image-a-19_1528666149170.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="She claimed that the non-surgical body-contouring industry is filled with misinformation that tricks people into thinking they can buy a perfect body (file photo)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>SCI-FI SMOOTHER</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The following year I went for the peculiarly named Strawberry Laser (from £650 for a course of six sessions). A ‘low-level’ or ‘cold’ laser procedure, it claims to melt fat. It’s not as Star Wars as it sounds: it employs infrared or near-infrared light that’s very different from powerful laser beams.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Laser expert Debbie Thomas, of D. Thomas Clinic, says: ‘They have an anti-inflammatory and mildly collagen-regenerating effect on the skin.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>expert view:</strong> ‘If infrared affects fat cells at all, it will be negligible,’ says Dr Dhillon, who, when he heard I was told to do ten minutes of step exercises after every session ‘to boost results’, was even more sceptical. ‘I would call that a red flag,’ he says. ‘The actual treatment outcome should stand on its own.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MY VERDICT:</strong> If you see ‘cold laser’ and ‘fat loss’ in the same sentence, run a mile — it will do more for you than the treatment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><strong>LOTS OF PAIN, NO GAIN</strong><strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A year later, I tried an ultrasound cavitation — a high-intensity ultrasound procedure that’s meant to make fat cells collapse or ‘explode’ in much the same way as radiofrequency, but this time using soundwaves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>expert view:</strong> Dr Dhillon rates ultrasound over radiofrequency for fat reduction, but advises: ‘Results are inconsistent.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He’s tried SlimME and Liposonix procedures, both of which aim to destroy fat cells with heat created through intense soundwaves and cost £1,595 and £1,000 respectively.</p><img id="i-26b94e785c49c2ef" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/01/4D1D478800000578-5827485-image-a-1_1528676330283.jpg" height="545" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The difficulty is no manufacturer (other machines include Vaser Shape and UltraShape) seems to agree on what frequency and intensity works best. And pain levels, which vary from warm to awful, are no indication of efficiency.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MY VERDICT:</strong> Liposonix was excruciating. A paddle emitting sound waves was passed over my fat pads for 20 minutes, and I felt like I was being stabbed. The treatment left me with black bruises that lasted six weeks and faded to reveal no change in the saddlebag situation whatsoever.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>THE FAT FREEZER</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At 42 and with my saddlebags staying put despite peak fitness, CoolSculpting seemed too good to resist. Inspired by research from Harvard, cryolipolysis freezes to death small pockets of fat in about half an hour. It smarts for a minute when the vacuum-like mouthpiece is attached to your fatty bits, but skin soon goes numb.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After defrosting (the procedure takes an hour), treated areas may feel sore for a few days. The body then flushes out the dead cells (only fat is affected) over two to four months. Results are permanent.</p><img id="i-a5d9e9638a9d46aa" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/22/4D1DEB9400000578-5827485-image-a-22_1528666216069.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="Among the seven treatments was one procedure which involved dozens of jabs into her thighs" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>expert view: </strong>‘CoolSculpting by Zeltiq has good safety and efficacy data behind it [other fat-freezing brands don’t], and is my preferred non-surgical fat-reduction option,’ says Dr Dhillon.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MY VERDICT:</strong> It works! After two-and-a-half rounds per leg, my saddlebags with cellulite are now flattish thighs with cellulite. But sadly it does nothing for the dreaded dimples.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another problem: the suction cups don’t quite respect the varying shapes of our wobbly bits, often resulting in inelegant ‘bite’ marks on one’s bulges — which can require more sessions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Only 25 pc of fat gets eliminated, so you may want several rounds in the same spot. At £800 per treatment, that adds up. Ten per cent of patients see no results.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>THE NO-KNIFE LIPO</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Next on my list was 3D Lipo, but contrary to how it sounds, I didn’t go under the knife. ‘Non-surgical’, ‘non-invasive’ or ‘laser’ liposuction are catch-all terms for any bodysculpting and fat ‘melting’ procedures. Most involve neither lasers nor liposuction.</p><img id="i-2841ca52b21ba96f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/01/4D1DEB9800000578-5827485-She_explains_her_seven_different_procedures_with_the_help_of_an_-a-3_1528676330425.jpg" height="584" width="634" alt="She explains her seven different procedures, with the help of an expert, and gives her verdict on the ones that work and the ones that don't" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>expert view:</strong> Dr Dhillon says: ‘“Lipo” misleadingly refers to liposuction, which is a surgical treatment and the only way to permanently remove a lot of fat, while the term “laser” is misused for lots of non-laser devices, such as radiofrequency and ultrasound.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The only true “laser lipo” is Vaser Liposuction [from £2,000], which inserts a laser under the skin to destroy fat cells that are then sucked out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘SculpSure [from £600], which implodes fat cells with laser heat without breaking the skin, is the only non-surgical laser fat-reduction option for now (but results are inconsistent).’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MY VERDICT:</strong> Not all non-invasive fat reduction is nonsense, but triple-check anything aggressively marketed with the words ‘lipo’ or ‘laser’. 3D Lipo (which offers a choice of cryolipolysis, radiofrequency or ultrasound, all, oddly, from the same machine, from £99) and Strawberry Laser (from £50) were some of the most pointless procedures I have ever tried.</p><img id="i-f454ae325f164980" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/22/4D1EA0CD00000578-5827485-image-a-23_1528666226166.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="Despite accepting that she couldn't look exactly how she wanted, she said that some of the treatments did improve her appearance (file photo)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>THE LEG VIBRATOR</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last year, I was one of the first to try Endospheres Therapy when it arrived here from Italy. Like a robotic deep-tissue massage, it delivers microcompression and vibration through a tool that pummels bulges to ‘break down fat’ and boost skin regeneration.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>expert view:</strong> ‘This technology works on so many levels,’ says UK Endospheres Therapy trainer Pietro Simone. ‘It drains lymph, increases oxygen in fat deposits to help their breakdown, boosts collagen, improves circulation and strengthens muscles. It’s the best body device I’ve used in my 16 years in the industry.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MY VERDICT:</strong> Love it. But it hurts, especially when you have my heavy legs and terrible circulation. However, I didn’t bruise and it made me feel lighter on my feet and de-puffed my legs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It also ‘sculpts’ your figure: my bottom was half an inch higher and looking a little narrower. That was after the recommended 12 treatments (£1,200; bi-monthly top-ups £120). I can’t say I have less cellulite, though.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>THE DRAINING JABS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fancy having a cocktail of vitamins, nutrients and diuretics injected into your pudgy bits? French people say mesotherapy will return your ‘contours’ to their naturally smooth, refined state.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>expert view:</strong> ‘The idea is to give the body and skin what’s needed to function optimally, and that’s most efficiently done through local injections,’ says Philippe Hamida-Pisal, president of the UK Society of Mesotherapy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To tackle cellulite, you need a personal cocktail based on your level of fat, damaged connective tissue, skin slackness and water retention. Ten sessions are recommended at £2,000, with £200 top-ups three times a year.</p><img id="i-ad643523448b01f4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/01/4D1EA0B000000578-5827485-She_said_that_after_having_more_than_12_000_worth_of_treatments_-a-2_1528676330355.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="She said that after having more than £12,000 worth of treatments over 11 years, she found that only three had a noticeable effect (file photo)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MY VERDICT:</strong> After six rather freaky treatments (long alcohol rubdowns for all-important hygiene and many, many blood-drawing stabs — in my case, a good 100 all around my thighs and bottom), I don’t really see my lumps and dents melting away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But surprisingly, my skin is tightening around my muscles. This works as a mild localised slimming treatment, but do check somuk.co.uk for qualified practitioners.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>THE QUICK SNIP </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those bottom craters? Thank hardened connective tissues, through which fat pushes up for a tufted-mattress finish.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Only Cellfina tackles it. A needle with a tiny blade is inserted into the skin and severs the connective bands for each individual dimple, letting puckered skin spring back up. This is a ‘minimally invasive’ surgical treatment, involving local anaesthetic, bruising and compression pants afterwards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>expert view:</strong> ‘This is very specific to cellulite,’ says Phi Clinic’s Mr Apul Parikh. ‘Patients and even some clinicians confuse lumpy fat, slack skin and stretch marks with cellulite. Treating those with Cellfina can make skin look worse, so don’t consider anyone but a qualified, experienced surgeon.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MY VERDICT: </strong>Earlier this year, Parikh took one look at my lumpy rump and said: ‘No.’ My dimples aren’t deep enough, it seems, and ‘people with your skin could scar or discolour. This procedure [from £3,500] is great for the right candidates, but out of every ten, I send away five or six.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now that is the sort of honesty we need from our body therapists. And the sort of talk we should learn to listen to.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, after having more than £12,000 worth of treatments over 11 years, I’ve found that only three had a noticeable effect. But there are rumours of CoolSculpting launching an anti-cellulite procedure and I’m already putting feelers out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m still hoping to spend at least one summer in bikini bottoms, not shorts, before I retire.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Beauty editor Inge Van Lotringen admits that she feels bad about her thighs despite spending £12,000 on treatment.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">A young woman named Violet Hilton strode hand in hand with her fiancé, Maurice Lambert, into a New York marriage licence bureau.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, 110 years later, Sussex historian Alf Le Flohic has launched a campaign to raise £1,500 to keep their memory alive by placing a blue plaque on their birthplace at 18 Riley Road.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was there that a 21-year-old unmarried barmaid called Kate Skinner brought the twins into the world.

Mary started by having postcards made featuring a picture of Violet and Daisy that she handed out at their christening and sold at the pub where she was also the landlady.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, the girls’ earliest memories were the smell of brown ale and visitors lifting their baby clothes to see the ‘join’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Violet and Daisy were two, Mary started exhibiting them at fairs and circuses.

As they filled out the paperwork, typists and clerks came out of nearby offices to stare at them. It was clear that if this couple married, it would be no ordinary wedding night. For standing on Violet’s left that day was her conjoined twin sister, Daisy (all pictured together left). Although their greatest success came in the U.S., the twins (right) had started life in Brighton on England’s south coast in February 1908. Now, 110 years later, Sussex historian Alf Le Flohic has launched a campaign to raise £1,500 to keep their memory alive by placing a blue plaque on their birthplace at 18 Riley Road.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Carol Driver</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T13:44:13.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>How British Siamese twins Violet and Daisy Hilton became stars</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T13:44:13.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5829849/Identical-twin-brothers-59-spent-entire-working-lives-shop.html" title="Identical twin brothers, 59, who have spent their entire working lives in the same shop and still live together look forward to spending more time in each other's company when they retire "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5827437/My-lightbulb-moment-Cosmetic-company-CEO-Lynne-Sanders.html" title="My lightbulb moment: Cosmetic company CEO Lynne Sanders on how a fight for equal pay led to her luxury make-up business "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5827539/Nursery-children-left-outside-rain-mud-day.html" title="The nursery where your little darlings are left outside in the rain and mud all day - and it has a waiting list of thousands"></link></item><item><title>The nursery where your little darlings are left outside in the rain and mud all day - and it has a waiting list of thousands</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5827539/Nursery-children-left-outside-rain-mud-day.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jun 2018 21:03:32 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5827539</guid><description><![CDATA[Leanna and James Barrett founded the Little Forest Folk nursery in Wimbledon, London's first outdoor nursery where children spend all day outside.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The set-up is guaranteed to bring today’s helicopter parents out in hives — hordes of gleefully unfettered pre-schoolers charging about outdoors, jumping in puddles, brandishing pointy sticks, even toasting marshmallows on campfires.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Welcome to Little Forest Folk, <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-bb14c9a0-6cf1-11e8-aceb-b7644e3d74a4">London</a>’s first outdoor nursery. Yes, an outdoor nursery. In which children aged from two to five learn and play outside in a wild part of Wimbledon Common from 9.30am to 3.30pm, rain or shine, which — inevitably — means a fair bit of rain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mumpreneur Leanna Barrett, co-founder of Little Forest Folk, believes it’s generally adults who don’t like rain — youngsters love jumping in puddles.</p><img id="i-89bcb2a643f370e4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/20/4D1D8B3200000578-5827539-image-a-6_1528660556898.jpg" height="449" width="634" alt="Children play together outside at Little Forest Folk in Wimbledon, which is London’s first outdoor nursery" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Children don’t tend to notice or feel weather as much as adults. We provide Scandinavian outer layers and each week send parents an email detailing the weather the coming week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There’s an old Scandinavian proverb: “There’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing.” We wholeheartedly agree” ’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And she’s far from alone. Earlier this month Ofsted’s Amanda Spearman gave a speech in which she underlined the importance of encouraging young children to ‘do what children do best. Running, jumping, skipping, scooting and climbing’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even the country’s two most prized nonagenarians, the Queen and Sir David Attenborough, are fans. Leanna and her co-founder husband, James, have a number of prized letters from Sir David Attenborough filed away.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He has said he thinks this is an incredibly valuable thing and the children will recognise this when they look back on the experience,’ says Leanna.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She and James are also winners of the 2018 Queen’s Award. So it’s no surprise that they have a waiting list that’s 2,100 strong.</p><img id="i-ca36b37d50c2e3d8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/20/4D1D8B3E00000578-5827539-image-a-7_1528660573242.jpg" height="483" width="634" alt="The nursery teaches children aged two to five to immerse themselves in nature by teaching all of their lessons outdoors" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leanna and James, who met while working in a safari camp in Botswana, southern Africa, came up with the idea of a forest nursery in the autumn of 2011 when their first child, Ella, now seven, was six months old.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘When she started crawling, she wanted to go outside all the time. We were living in London and it was not the way we had grown up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘She would be banging on the patio doors and playing on this tiny patch of grass. We wanted her to have a childhood like we’d had, but we didn’t want to move to the country.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leanna, 40, grew up in Merthyr in Wales, while James, 39, was from the countryside in New South Wales in Australia. She returned to work as an analyst in the Home Office when Ella was nine months old, and the couple discovered that the kind of childcare they wanted for their daughter simply didn’t exist.</p><img id="i-2b46b5bb45905f47" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/21/4D1E35E400000578-5827539-image-a-10_1528661921773.jpg" height="951" width="634" alt="The innovative nursery was founded by Leanna (pictured) and James Barrett who said they took inspiration from Scandinavian education" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We thought we needed to create some way of her being outdoors all day long. We liked the Scandinavian system. We wanted to do something like that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I must have been Googling and we talked briefly about moving to Scandinavia so that she could have that type of education. Then we kept coming back to “but we like our lives here”,’ recalls Leanna, who talks nine to the dozen and fizzes with energy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When their second child, Jack, arrived in 2013, they decided to make this dream a reality. Leanna did not return to her job, and they drew up a business plan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Everyone thought it was crazy! Even my NCT group. A couple of them thought it was great, most of them thought it was a nice concept, but they said they would never send their own children there.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It was an unheard of thing then — now it is much more popular,’ says Leanna.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">None of the banks would lend the couple any money and they didn’t qualify for a government start-up loan either because you have to have been trading for three months before you can apply, which was impossible in their case.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘So we decided that we would remortgage the house. We thought: “We are doing this to try to get our kids to have an outdoor childhood. So if the worst thing happens and it completely fails and we lose all the money, we’ll sell the house and we’ll move to the country so our kids are still outdoors.” ’</p><img id="i-6dd160e6818f95ae" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/20/4D1DDADF00000578-5827539-image-a-8_1528660691361.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="They were forced to remortgage their house as none of the banks would lend them any money and they didn’t qualify for a government start-up loan" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">At this point James was still working as a policy adviser in the Department of Energy and Climate Change. ‘He was our accountant, Finance Director and everything else by night,’ recalls Leanna.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With the money and the drive to succeed, the couple were half-way there, but what they needed was a suitable site.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Opening in Wimbledon was really hard, as there was nothing like this anywhere. We just had to keep on talking to Merton Council,’ Leanna says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In January 2015, the first Little Forest Folk opened in Wimbledon with Leanna, three staff and ten children (including Ella).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The children would play outside all day whatever the weather, dressed in their brightly coloured Didriksons waterproof dungarees, jackets and waterproof boots. (Hoods and tarps would be put up if it rained.)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the first year, James was still working and I was trying to run the business with Jack [then 21 months] with me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘A lot of the time I couldn’t do stuff in the day as I’d have to look after him, so I’d have to do things when he was sleeping or at night. We both worked until midnight or 1am every night for at least a year.’</p><img id="i-76d1613d98d2d7bf" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/20/4D1DDAD700000578-5827539-image-a-9_1528660696273.jpg" height="456" width="634" alt="Eventually, in January 2015, the first Little Forest Folk opened in Wimbledon with Leanna, three staff and ten children" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">That first year they applied for the Big Venture Challenge, a Lottery-funded initiative that helps social entrepreneurs in education to grow their business quickly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Through that, they found an investor who has since become a valued friend and adviser.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then, the applecart was overturned: ‘The day we were due to go to the big launch evening, we found out I was pregnant with Indie!’ laughs Leanna.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In these early days Leanna cooked all the snacks and lunches for the children. Naturally these were (and still are) healthy, seasonal and homemade.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘One of my long-standing memories of how hard that time was is making fish croquettes with morning sickness. It was horrible!’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leanna’s far too busy to be cooking for the nurseries these days. That important job has gone to one of the mothers at Ella’s primary school, who now cooks breakfast, snacks, lunches and dinners for their five nurseries in Wimbledon, Barnes, Wandsworth, Chiswick and Fulham. What started as a couple’s dream, and a ragtag crew of ten children has blossomed into 120 children, 63 staff and five sites.</p><img id="i-b18f84ebf74683d7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/21/4D1E703300000578-5827539-image-a-11_1528663327370.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="As well as the branch in Wimbledon, they now run nurseries in Barnes, Wandsworth, Chiswick and Fulham" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The fees range from £62-£93 per day depending on the site, with 12.5 per cent of places being free of charge to children from deprived backgrounds. Not that it has been plain sailing. ‘When I was in labour with Indie, James got the call that the Wandsworth site we were meant to be opening had just decided to change their mind. Thank goodness he didn’t tell me. He was really weird during the labour and part of me was thinking: “What is wrong with you?” But then you don’t pay attention after a while. He didn’t tell me for a month.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leanna worried for the first six weeks after having Indie that she would find it hard to get back her enthusiasm for the project. ‘It only works at this intensity because we love it,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What’s more, she spent two weeks in intensive care after giving birth, for HELLP syndrome (a form of pre-eclampsia), on top of a pregnancy involving obstetric cholestasis and gestational diabetes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then came the call for their first Ofsted inspection when Indie was just six weeks old. Leanna had to go to the Wimbledon site with her baby strapped to her. But it was worth it — the nursery was certified as outstanding by Ofsted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What Leanna and James started has now become something of an educational movement, and they are inundated with requests to open more nurseries. Being outside certainly stirs the creative juices. Leanna recounts how a group of little boys at the Wimbledon nursery made a time machine out of a palette, bin lids, ropes and log stumps so they could go back in time and compare the Cretaceous period with the Jurassic period.</p><img id="i-ea9fd6866aa838cf" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/21/4D1E704D00000578-5827539-image-a-12_1528663335758.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The couple are now planning on building on their success and want to open a project-based primary school in January 2019" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘When they said they were going to the Jurassic period, the adults suggested they got their faces painted and they all went and hid in the bushes and played dinosaurs for a while.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Winning the Queen’s Award for innovation 2018 has been the icing on the cake. ‘We get to go to Buckingham Palace for a reception on June 28,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Palace will also send someone to one of the nurseries (probably Chiswick) to present the award. ‘That is when we can get all the parents along,’ says Leanna, beaming with pride.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not content with revolutionising nursery education, the couple plan to open a project-based primary school in January 2019.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The school will start with 16 reception age and 16 years one, two and three children, who will learn in mixed age groups. Leanna has spent the past few months penning the curriculum and plans to be headmistress while it gets off the ground.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jack and Ella, now five and seven, will be among the school’s founding pupils.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Essentially everything I am doing is for my own children,’ jokes Leanna, but luckily hundreds of other youngsters benefit along the way.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Come rain or shine, children at the Little Forrest Folk nursery in Wimbledon, London spend all day outside (pictured left).

Ms Caldwell said it rapidly stopped Billy’s seizures and drastically improved his quality of life. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the single mother from Castlederg, County Tyrone, was left distraught last month when the Home Office told her family doctor to stop doling out the drug or face disbarment. ‘I had to read the email six times in disbelief,’ she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So on Thursday – one day before her son’s supply ran out – she flew to Toronto to get a new prescription, accompanied by this newspaper. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">She will return tomorrow with a six-month supply of a specialist cannabis oil, which is administered in oral drops. ‘I hate having to do this,’ she said. ‘For a mother to be pushed into breaking the law to keep her son alive is horrendous. But this drug has given me hope and given my son back his right to life. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Of course I worry about breaking the law – but I want my son illegally alive rather than legally dead.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ms Caldwell will be met at Heathrow by the parents of eight other children with epilepsy supporting her campaign. ‘We’re fighting not just for ourselves but to give all those other families the right to hope,’ she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are backed by Dan Poulter, a former Tory Health Minister who still works part-time as a doctor in mental health services. He recently started an all-party parliamentary group supported by three other doctors at Westminster pushing to legalise medical cannabis. ‘The current law is ridiculous,’ said Mr Poulter. ‘There is growing evidence cannabis products used medically can be helpful in a number of conditions, but it is still seen through the prism of illegality.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He called on Ministers to ensure Ms Caldwell is allowed through customs unimpeded. ‘This is both medically the right thing to do and humanely the right thing to do.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This challenge comes amid growing pressure for reform from patients and families. Three months ago, Theresa May met the parents of Alfie Dingley, a six-year-old with epilepsy, who had been treating their son successfully with an oil obtained in Holland.</p><img id="i-3dcba485ce3a4972" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/21/4D17CDC700000578-5825117-image-a-26_1528575489674.jpg" height="408" width="306" alt="Ms Caldwell’s trip to Canada, where she is pictured with Billy, was aided by the Centre for Medical Cannabis, a pressure group led by former government adviser Blair Gibbs" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May was moved by the case and promised to find a way to make the medicine available for them in Britain. Home Office officials, however, fear opening the floodgates for other patients who would be able to seek judicial review if denied cannabis treatment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ironically, Britain is the world’s largest exporter of legal cannabis grown for medical markets. A recent poll found three-quarters of voters back doctors being permitted to prescribe cannabis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ms Caldwell is a passionate promoter of the cause after seeing the dramatic impact on her son’s life. Even after 20 hours awake, travelling from Ulster to London, then on to Toronto, Billy was smiling and energetic – despite standing up for much of the transatlantic flight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On Friday, the boy was examined by doctors. They also questioned Ms Caldwell on his medical history and weighed her son before prescribing the drug and setting the dose. I agreed not to reveal the doctors’ names. But one said he had seen at least ten other British patients in the past two years at his Ontario clinic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I have no doubt this is an effective drug,’ he said. ‘A couple of years ago, lots of my colleagues did not agree with prescribing it but now they are referring patients to me and telling their families to come here for treatment.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ms Caldwell calls epilepsy ‘brutal’ for its destructive impact on families and sufferers. But the doctor said cannabis could reduce the intensity of seizures, soften their impact, enable patients to cut powerful cocktails of prescribed drugs and slash the number of attacks. ‘I love hearing that one of my patients has not had a seizure for six months,’ he added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These are dramatic claims, especially given the risk of sudden death during seizures. Sceptics argue much evidence is anecdotal, although there is more and more clinical data as use of medical cannabis rises. ‘It’s not a miracle drug but it deserves respect,’ said one expert.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The laws on the medical use of marijuana were liberalised in 2001 in Canada – on the day we arrived it also sanctioned the legalisation and regulation of recreational use.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The drug prescribed for Billy is made by Tilray, a British Columbian manufacturer. Like most cannabis-based epilepsy medicines, it has a very high ratio of CBD (the non-psychoactive chemical found in the plant) to THC (the chemical that intoxicates users). Doctors told me it would be impossible to use this drug to get high – and since it is an oil, the THC cannot be separated out. Cannabis products containing THC are illegal in Britain.</p><img id="i-6d49a4e11b971680" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/21/4D17CE2100000578-5825117-image-m-29_1528576098152.jpg" height="490" width="634" alt="Ms Caldwell raised more cash and returned to her US doctor, who discussed the concept of medical cannabis, sent her to a specialist and found the correct dosage to stop the seizures" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tilray’s director of clinical research Catherine Jacobson, whose own child has epilepsy, said cannabis contains more than 100 different chemical compounds so the challenge was to work out which worked for particular conditions, then the correct doses.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I would never give my son street cannabis,’ she said. ‘You do not know what you are giving them or how much you are giving them.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Britain’s cannabis ban comes under the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act. Campaigners argue this muddles recreational and medical use but Ministers are wary of reform amid concerns that stronger street cannabis is causing an epidemic of mental health problems among younger users.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet Ms Caldwell fears the Government is forcing British parents into illegality, either by using cannabis bought from street dealers or by smuggling in medical products permitted abroad in countries such as Canada, Germany and the US.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is her latest battle since Billy’s birth turned her life upside down, forcing her to ditch a thriving career in the tourist industry. Her relationship with Billy’s father quickly fell apart and she is constantly with her son, even at night. She has one other adult son.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The epilepsy became evident when Billy was four months old, leading to a 16-week stay in hospital. ‘I just felt powerless and sick in my heart,’ she said. ‘He was having hundreds of seizures a day and they could not get them under control.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After doctors told her they could do no more for the boy, she raised £250,000 in just ten weeks to fund treatment in Chicago. She spent two years living there as her son was given intensive physiotherapy to boost his development.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I was kept going by love, faith and hope for Billy,’ she said. ‘I dreamed one day he might be able to run towards me and say, “Mummy.” It was like a miracle when he finally did this.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the cash ran out, she borrowed £25,000 from a bank to pay for private treatment and moved to Oxfordshire. ‘Eighteen months later Billy walked through the airport in Ireland. I was left with nothing but I felt triumphant that he was walking and free of seizures.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the epilepsy returned with frightening strength two years ago, which doctors blamed on a brain lesion triggered by earlier seizures. They raised the possibility of surgery, but it would have wiped out his memory and hard-fought ability to walk.</p><img id="i-332aeb856c80e7f7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/21/4D17CDCE00000578-5825117-image-a-28_1528575586757.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="After doctors told her they could do no more for the boy, Ms Caldwell raised £250,000 in just ten weeks to fund treatment in Chicago" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ms Caldwell raised more cash and returned to her US doctor, who had moved from Chicago to a Los Angeles hospital. He discussed the concept of medical cannabis, sent her to a specialist and eventually they found the correct dosage to stop the wretched seizures. After eight months in California, funds dried up again. The pair returned to Northern Ireland – and spent eight days walking 150 miles from their home to the hospital to highlight the dramatic improvements in Billy’s condition thanks to his cannabis treatment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her GP agreed in April last year to prescribe cannabis oil, supplied by an American company – until the Government warning last month to stop.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘My mission as Billy’s mum is to keep him alive. I scoured the globe to find the medicine that was saving his life. The debate on cannabis is so muddled – this is not recreational cannabis but a safe, regulated drug. And this is not just for Billy. There are 240 other children in Northern Ireland alone who suffer intractable epilepsy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Can you imagine how cruel it is to see children having these seizures knowing there is a drug that could help but they are not allowed it? We have to find a solution.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ms Caldwell’s trip to Canada was aided by the Centre for Medical Cannabis, a pressure group led by former government adviser Blair Gibbs. ‘This isn’t about legalising pot but providing safe, pharmaceutical grade products for a defined set of health conditions,’ he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Home Office said: ‘We are sympathetic to the difficult and rare situation that Billy and his family are faced with.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘While we recognise that people with debilitating illnesses are looking to alleviate their symptoms, it is important that medicines are thoroughly tested to ensure they meet rigorous standards so that doctors and patients are assured of their efficacy, quality and safety.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have rarely met a more determined person than Ms Caldwell. Her efforts have made her something of a celebrity in Northern Ireland, with one man in a wheelchair on her flight from Belfast giving her £10 with instructions to ‘buy Billy a wee gift’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So as we left one of the Canadian clinics, I asked what will she do if officials take away her son’s supply when she lands tomorrow. ‘I’ll go back and get some more,’ she said.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The desperate mother of 12-year-old Billy Caldwell, (pictured left) who suffers from severe epilepsy plans to fly back to Britain with a consignment of medical cannabis obtained in Canada and declare it to customs officials.

A gastric band is a radical, surgical operation that reduces the available space in the stomach. But even people that have thought about having one, can’t face the surgery or the expense. This is where my Hypnotic Gastric Band can help you. A Hypnotic Gastric Band is a psychological procedure that helps to convince the unconscious mind that a gastric band has actually been fitted, so the body behaves as if it were physically present.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This, in turn, allows you to eat less and feel completely satisfied. You can leave food on your plate and you don't feel like you are missing out. You can enjoy your food and still lose weight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is how it works - alongside this text you are reading now, there is a 25-minute hypnotic trance that you can listen to, here at Mail Online for the next 7 days for free. There's no physical surgery, no scarring and no forbidden foods. All you have to do is follow all the instructions and let me help you lose weight.</p><video preload="none" id="5611393301747512879" title="British hypnotist Paul McKenna's gastric band technique" poster="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/09/4CBF08F900000578-0-image-m-12_1527668968962.jpg">

  </video><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over the years, I have done a great deal of research into how the body works and how it is influenced by psychological processes such as visualization, mind-programming and hypnosis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some people wonder how good they are at visualizing. It is actually very easy. Try this experiment. Think of your front door. Which side is the lock on? To answer that question, you called to mind a picture of your door. That is visualization, and we can all do it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Visualization can radically affect your body. When you imagine something stressful, your body releases adrenaline and your muscles tense up. When you imagine something relaxing, your body chemistry changes and your muscles relax.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a similar way, when you imagine you have gone through a procedure in which your stomach has shrunk from the size of a melon to the size of a tennis ball, it actually affects the signaling system of the body, so that after a just few mouthfuls, you begin to feel comfortably full. Curious as this may seem, the result is that even though you know you have not had a physical operation, your body responds as though you have, and a gastric band is in place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am now going to explain, just briefly, some of the key points of your digestive process and how a Hypnotic Gastric Band helps you to lose weight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As you begin to chew your food, the saliva begins breaking it down and your stomach prepares to receive it by releasing hydrochloric acid. When it gets to your stomach, it is broken down more and the acid kills off any unwanted bacteria. Next, the food goes into your small intestine where another set of enzymes break down the proteins, peptides, fats and starches even further. The molecular chains are now small enough to pass through the walls of your intestine and be taken into your bloodstream and your liver. In the large intestine, water and various salts and chemicals are reabsorbed into the body and the remaining waste is excreted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All of this is controlled by a set of hormones and many of them do more than one job. For example, GLP1, which tells your brain that you have had enough to eat, also slows down the release of acid in the stomach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The vital point is that when we fit your Hypnotic Gastric Band, we are not just reducing the available space in your stomach, we are also carefully recalibrating the hormonal and nervous signaling system which governs your digestion and how full you feel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is why it is so effective, because it communicates directly with all these interlocking processes, which are controlled by the unconscious mind. Your psychological gastric band will recalibrate your feeling of fullness at a physiological level.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Satiety is another word for fullness. It is a very specific and important feeling, but if you have been dieting or over-eating, your awareness of it may have become confused. In order to help you get back in touch with it, I'd like you to try a little thought experiment now.</p><img id="i-b82b4e78a7dd2b12" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/16/4CBAC00C00000578-5783239-As_part_of_his_Slim_Down_For_Summer_series_Paul_McKenna_is_givin-m-5_1527607337784.jpg" height="1162" width="634" alt="As part of his Slim Down For Summer series Paul McKenna is giving readers healthy eating tips " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">First of all, think of a time when you were absolutely stuffed: so full that it was uncomfortable and maybe you felt bloated and even a bit nauseous.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, think of a different time, a time when you were ravenous, so hungry that it was almost an ache in your stomach and you felt empty and desperate for something to eat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">OK, now, remember feeling stuffed again…</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, desperately hungry…</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Go back and forth between these two memories and notice how different they feel to you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So long as you can tell the difference between feeling stuffed and feeling starving, your mind has all it needs to begin the process of recalibration.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your unconscious mind will use these memories when you listen to the Hypnotic Gastric Band to reset your feeling of satiety and give you a clear sense of the many stages available between these two extremes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You never ever need to go to either of these extremes again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From now on, you will find that you notice the fullness feeling more easily and more often. In the old days, you may have ignored or passed this point without paying it much attention. With your Hypnotic Gastric Band fitted, you will reach this point more quickly, so it is important to look out for it, to avoid unnecessary discomfort. If you are at all unsure, just pause and stop eating for three or four minutes and then check how you feel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your unconscious mind will make the fullness come more swiftly, clearly and urgently as a result of your Hypnotic Gastric Band.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When you listen to the hypnotic trance, it is perfectly all right if you consciously listen to every word but it does not matter if you cannot consciously remember a word. What you do or don't remember is not important, because the language in the mind-programming technique is directed towards your unconscious mind, which hears everything it needs to hear.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many people have been sceptical when they have used these psychological techniques to lose weight and change their lifestyle, and it is important to keep whatever scepticism you have until you have truly proven to yourself that you have achieved success with these tools and you do not have to believe in anything to benefit from them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, listen to the Hypnotic Gastric Band trance and look forward to feeling lighter and fitter and enjoying your new thinner body!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For information about Paul McKenna’s new online weight loss course <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.paulmckennaonline.com/slimdownforsummer">click here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>EXCLUSIVE: Slim Down For Summer.

But in fact, many say we should turn our attentions towards the daily foods beloved by doctors and health professionals if we're seeking good health. Recently, the TV doctor and certified medic, Dr Sandro Demaio (left and right), shared his day on a plate - as well as the foods that he would never eat and the items that should be cut from your diet forever. The 33-year-old Melbourne-based author of The Doctor's Diet believes healthy eating is simple, provided you know where and how to shop right.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Oliver Gillman</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-09T18:34:15.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Doctor reveals what he really eats in a day for good health</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-09T18:34:15.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/food/article-5815135/Hidden-sugar-favourite-healthy-treat-really-good-you.html" title="Is your favourite 'healthy' treat really so good for you?

This would be far better than placing a row of umbrellas and ankle socks at the till.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">OFFER US SOME STYLE ADVICE</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">M&amp;S shop assistants are almost all polite and friendly, but it’s a challenge to find anyone on the shop floor who can help in any way. They are all too busy trying to work out where some rail or other has been moved to.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it’s not enough to point us in the general direction. Older customers want to look terrific but they often want proper help in finding what suits them, so why not put some staff on the clothing floors who can advise and steer?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe shout louder about your online personal shopping service trytuesday.com, where stylists will revamp your wardrobe with no obligation to buy. This really is one of your best-kept secrets.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox femail" data-version="2" id="mol-c392d3e0-6b77-11e8-b6b7-038c76e573d4">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Keep it oh-so simple </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shoppers are returning to the old-fashioned habit of buying little and often.

Surely the windows could be put to more exciting use? Take a leaf out of Selfridges’, Liberty’s or Fortnum and Mason’s book and use the windows as the incredible marketing tool that they are.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No one is wildly interested in the current display of cropped trousers on some skinny manneqins. Who is likely to be lured into the store by that?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">GIVE US SOME SEXY LINGERIE</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is personal. I have relied on M&amp;S for bras and knickers for many years, but something’s gone badly wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My recent trip to the underwear department was like recceing a retirement home with a feeling of dread one might end up there.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I used to be able to find a pretty rose-print balconette bra or a delicate lace number, even though I come into the larger cup range. But now the arsenal of hefty over-the-shoulder boulder-holders would daunt even Margaret Rutherford’s Miss Marple.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And where, oh where, is a minimal but sexy range of soft, plain, white cotton briefs?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Simple and pretty one-colour hipster briefs have been replaced by multi-coloured, patterned five packs. It’s almost impossible to buy a single item of underwear. I’d rather pay a couple of pounds more to get the right item than get two-for-one of the wrong.</p><img id="i-8af508593c96728e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/01/4D109A1600000578-5823397-M_S_Collection_2_pack_bras_18-m-62_1528503262776.jpg" height="961" width="634" alt="M&amp;S Collection 2-pack bras, £18" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">SEND CHICKEN KIEV TO OUR DOOR</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">M&amp;S food is first class, but we just want to be able to get hold of it in decent time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The limited ‘Food to Order’ range, which offers tasty options for entertaining, has lead times of five days. This just isn’t an option — even if the canapés are delicious. Who wants to wait five days to get their hands on an array of Indian bhaji or crudités and dip? M&amp;S are under the cosh from price cutting in the supermarket food arena, but a start would be speedy deliveries across a whole range of everyday foods.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why can’t we get the chicken kievs or mashed potatoes, lemon tarts and vanilla custards on home delivery, too?</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox femail" data-version="2" id="mol-75899ac0-6b78-11e8-b6b7-038c76e573d4">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Don't ignore oldies </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">M&amp;S tries to achieve the impossible; to be all things to all people.

E-commerce is growing year on year, but the majority of sales are still made instore — everywhere. So the quality of the stores and their products is paramount.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Investment no doubt needs to be made in the digital infrastructure, which currently doesn’t match that of newer, nimbler businesses, but the best retailers recognise that it is the on and off-line partnership which is key — so often shoppers find what they like in-store then go home to order online or vice versa: they find the product online, then check out how it actually looks and feels in the store.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox femail" data-version="2" id="mol-a4353c80-6b78-11e8-b6b7-038c76e573d4">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Ditch the brands </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">What is the point of all the in-house brands: Autograph, Per Una, Limited Edition, Classic, M&amp;S Collection and Twiggy?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By far the best pieces I found were under the M&amp;S Collection label.

But in others, the baton has been snatched by rivals on the High Street who are competing well on price and beating on design.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Look closely at the opposition and take note! For example, M&amp;S has a couple of nice, boxy, boucle jackets, but there’s a slightly leaner and more stylish one at Zara.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The silky print, pyjama-style trouser suits at Mango are the kind of thing that can be worn from ages 18 to 80 and are incredibly well-priced.</p><img id="i-7331fbfaa7494be7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/01/4D10997200000578-5823397-image-a-59_1528502947621.jpg" height="803" width="634" alt="But in others, the baton has been snatched by rivals on the High Street who are competing well on price and beating on design" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The display of holiday buys at H&amp;M is immediately attractive, mixing straw hats, baskets, cover-ups and swimwear, as opposed to the unfocused clump of beach wear hiding in a corner at M&amp;S.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The devil is lurking in the detail: tropical swimwear is great, but make sure colour combinations aren’t too crass; dial back on the easy-iron messaging that is displayed more prominently than the price. Ditch the Lurex thread that stalks Per Una.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And don’t feel that every piece of casual menswear needs a logo of some kind . . .</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Get this right and the tendency to lower our voices and ‘confess’ that our party dress came from Marks &amp; Spencer will change to a proud proclamation of our canny shopping. </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Once again, Marks &amp; Spencer is the bearer of bad news: 100 stores are closing and profits are down. Ask anyone and they will have an opinion on the subject. My own comment last week — that the stores were a sea of dullness — certainly seemed to strike a chord. Britain, it seems, cares. And while we all care, there’s hope. It’s once we stop caring that the last rites will be administered. M&amp;S is not just a store. It’s a whole value system — high quality, good prices, trustworthiness. We treasure it as a safe place which is central to so many of our lives.

Years ago he started secretly drinking at home and hiding the empty bottles. He lies constantly.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>A while ago, after he ended up in hospital, he had counselling for a few months, but he never managed to fight the booze.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Our marriage has deteriorated so much I just don’t like him, let alone love him any more. I’ve lost all respect for him, as have our children. I’ve tried to interest him in activities, but he won’t try anything.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Since retiring, I’ve more or less done my own thing and dislike him more and more.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Alcohol has taken over his life, but he covers it well. After a night on the booze he’ll drive the car next morning, denying he’ll still be over the limit.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>I foolishly thought he could sort all this out, but have concluded he won’t and life will go on unhappily unless I take the initiative and do something.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>A year or so ago I was going to move out, but he promised to sort himself out. I suggested Alcoholics Anonymous, but he denied he had a problem.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>At least now he admits he has. He ended up in hospital again recently and is due to see a counsellor yet again — but I don’t hold out much hope.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>He says he still loves me. (There’s been no physical contact for years.) He refuses to move out, so I’d have to be the one to leave.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>This thought disturbs my sleep. I wake in the small hours worrying about how I’ll cope on my own, but in the morning remind myself I’ve run the house for years without his help.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>I’m quite a sociable person normally, but my confidence is low and I’m afraid of loneliness. I sometimes wonder if it’s all my fault, as I’m constantly nagging him about one thing or another because he just annoys me so much.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>He’s not a bad person and has never been cruel to me, but our marriage has soured. I ask myself — is this what the rest of my life will be like?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>LINDA</strong></p><img id="i-e3bce1a90e5200d3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/18/4D0EF96E00000578-5822329-image-a-20_1528478492020.jpg" height="840" width="634" alt="This week, a 62-year-old woman describes how her marriage has deteriorated due to her husband’s abuse of alcohol " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once again I read and re-read a letter to which there is no obvious reply (see also the second one on today’s page) — simply because tried-and-tested advice seems to have failed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the same postbag as yours, I received a very short email from S, married for 32 years, who writes: ‘I love my husband now just as much as ever. I also believe he loves me, however there is definitely a third person in our marriage — drink.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Things are particularly difficult at the moment as he was made redundant a few months ago and he’s found it hard to get even interviews, no matter how many agencies he’s with. I just don’t know what to do. He’s a lovely, kind man when not hungover, but not very nice at other times and I’m fed up with it all.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Obviously, the first advice I would give S would be to try to get her husband proper help for his addiction as well as counselling for the problem (being out of work) that is making it worse.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you put ‘Help for alcohol abuse’ or similar words into a search engine, various avenues of help open up. And al-anonuk.org.uk has much to offer the families of alcoholics. But the significant difference between these two emails is that S still loves her husband while you, Linda, do not.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You are locked into a cycle of misery: with no respect for your husband, you take it out on him which (you guess) leads him to drink all the more.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Have you discussed this with your children? Are they a source of support, even if they live far away? Might you go for an extended stay, telling him to think things over seriously while you’re away?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I think this would be a good start — and might even shock him into realising he must act.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You certainly need help in working out a plan for the rest of your life, so I urge you to be honest with your children.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Failing that, do you have enough money to rent a bedsit, even if temporarily?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It seems to me you are in serious need of breathing space, before you two end up destroying each other. It might help you to find out the location of your nearest Relate centre (relate.org.uk) and book a counselling session on your own, to help clarify the issues that keep you awake. At 4am, everything seems worse and your mind jumps through hoops. Focus on that strong morning self which says: ‘I can run my own life — because I always have.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You tell me that you have thought of writing many times, but have been too scared. Of what? That I might encourage you to be brave and step forward into your own life? Think of the years ahead and act now to make them better.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My grown-up daughter is so lonely</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Dear Bel,</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My daughter (37) is beautiful and intelligent (a qualified teacher), but cannot work and is so lonely and depressed it breaks my heart.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>She suffers from panic attacks and depression and because of this has no friends, no social life and no partner. She has a long-standing friend, a virtual recluse also plagued by mental health issues. He promises her the world, but continually lets her down and is emotionally abusive. She will not walk away, as he is the only person she has.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Her so-called friends constantly let her down — rarely contacting her and then cancelling any arrangements to meet at the last minute. She goes out of her way to be kind and thoughtful, but does not get the same response from them. She is not an easy person, as she has structured ideas. Her illness means she has to live with boundaries, however I cannot tell you how hard she tries to live a ‘normal’ life.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>She has had all the normal treatments for her condition, but nothing worked. Her make-up, unfortunately, is in her genes.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>We have supported her all her life, but fear she is going to be single and lonely always. I cannot tell you how painful it is for us as parents.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>She has two siblings with children and is so good with them. But as families they get on with their lives and she’s on the sidelines.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What can we do for her? We just want her to be cared for and have a settled life with children of her own. Do you have any ideas?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>EILEEN</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Believe me, I can easily imagine how hard it is for you as parents — because I, too, have a daughter that age and feel any problem she has like an ache (or a stab) in my heart.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the moment, one of my friends is enduring serious, complicated problems with one of her adult daughters that seem intractable. That’s what being a parent is like — and it never ends. How I feel for you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s so difficult for me to give advice here, because you tell me ‘she has had all the normal treatments for her condition but nothing worked’. I imagine by ‘normal treatments’ you mean referrals from her GP for counselling, or even drugs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Has she tried cognitive behavioural therapy? It has been seen to work in circumstances like these.</p><div class="mol-columnist moduleHalf mol-columnist-module"><div class="item">

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am sure you know all these things already, but the websites anxiety.org.uk and nopanic.org.uk may be useful, and the mental health charity MIND has a free document that includes some useful tips (go to mind.org.uk and search for CBT).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It seems obvious that your daughter’s boyfriend (I use the term as shorthand) is toxic. I can guess how much you wish he would just go away, yet realise you are powerless to make that happen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It sounds as if she has always had problems forming healthy relationships. I’m wondering if she has ever tried yoga — a spiritual, mental and physical practice that engages the whole self and helps achieve good breathing that’s absolutely essential. Pilates can help with that, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These are potential ‘remedies’ you may not find suggested by a GP, so it might be an idea for you to find out what is on offer around where you live — and possibly accompany her to some sessions. You never know, something like that could let a gleam of light enter her life. ‘New Age’ philosophies and remedies have their place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Might I just question two things in your letter? You attribute her problems to ‘her genes’ — which may or may not be true (I am no expert on mental health and genetics), but such fatalism contradicts the spirit in which you wrote.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You have to go on believing that your daughter can be helped, that change is possible, that whatever wound in her innermost self has caused her state can, in time, be healed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The second point is your wistful longing that she can ‘have a settled life with children of her own’. I don’t honestly think it does you any good to dwell on that dream, because it will only intensify your sadness at the worrisome present.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Far better to survey the situation one day at a time — otherwise it becomes overwhelming. Why not take your daughter out to lunch to talk things through? Present her with a pretty notebook and ask her to write down her thoughts each day, to tether them. This is a useful therapy. Then suggest an activity (as above) you can maybe share. And never lose hope.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>And finally... Feed your heart and let joy grow</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Each year I vow to grow plants from seed, but always leave it too late. So a quick visit to the local garden centre is followed by hard work on the pots and containers. This week, when I’d finished, I ached. All that bending left the old gal shattered.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Have you ever visited a garden, perhaps in somebody’s home or maybe at a National Trust or English Heritage property, and felt envious? Those clipped box hedges, elegant flower borders, bushy, well-pruned roses, hostas miraculously free from slug-munch holes . . . How do they do it?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The answer is obvious. Those gardeners (dedicated amateurs or paid) painstakingly clip the hedges, weed like demons, plant according to the height and width of perennials, get busy with the secateurs (not left out in the rain like mine) at the right time, feed containers regularly and sneak out at night to pick off murderous slugs and snails.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS femail" data-version="2" id="mol-4e457060-6b41-11e8-b860-7b649132a4cb">                                                        <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Bel answers readers’ questions on emotional and relationship problems each week. </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Write to Bel Mooney, Daily Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT, or email bel.mooney@dailymail.co.uk. </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>A pseudonym will be used if you wish. </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Bel reads all letters but regrets she cannot enter into personal correspondence.</strong></p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">They, too, having aching backs, sore knees and blistered hands. But it’s worth it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once I used to claim I had ‘black fingers’ — the opposite of green. Why was that something to seem proud of? I’ve given lovely house plants to people who said, ‘Oh, I always manage to kill them’ — when actually if you read the instructions (don’t put your orchid in full sun, for example), you have a good chance of enjoying that plant for a long time. After all, they are alive and deserve care.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what does that require? Attention and exertion, that’s what. Sleepless with aches after gardening, I thought of this as a metaphor for life in general.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can pass truly modest homes where the garden or balcony is glorious with flowers, and others so sad, unkempt, neglected. Most of the time this has little to do with income, but reveals a story about people ready to work at what matters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anything worthwhile in this life requires endeavour. Yes, you may ache, but happiness requires effort. So water that plant — and your loves. Prune bad relationships. Feed your heart, then admire its beauty.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>This week, BEL MOONEY offers advice to a woman, 62, whose marriage has deteriorated due to her husband’s abuse of alcohol.

Wilson, author and former Oxford tutor" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s not surprising that more young people apply to be on Love Island than apply to Oxford and Cambridge, because it’s a fact that there are more stupid people in the world than clever ones.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To attend a good university, you have to be clever. To want to be on Love Island, you would have to be very stupid indeed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The orange-coloured, gym-honed morons who appear in it presumably dream of a future as mini-celebrities or underwear models. What they don’t realise is that nearly everyone who watches it does so to mock them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is a depraved, silly show. Not just because the participants are for most of the time half-naked. Or because they are paired off, and share beds, to see if they might form sexual relationships. But mainly because it encourages viewers to treat other human beings as objects of scorn. There could be no other reason to watch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The contestants think we are interested in who gets off with whom — yet they are not interesting enough to be the subjects even of transitory gossip. The real interest seems to consist in plumbing the bottomless stupidity of these sad, incoherent people.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In one episode I watched, there were six boys and five girls. None had really formed a pair, and one couple were relieved to discover they need no longer pretend to be more than ‘just mates’. ‘There’s just sumfink missin’,’ said the female in this pair.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Too right there was, but not what she thought. It was brains that were missing, not sexual chemistry.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The drama of the episode consisted in the arrival of two new girls. This, thanks to the sadists who organise the show, gave the boys a chance to drop the girl they had been paired with and go off with one of the new arrivals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As one chap called Wes eloquently put it: ‘We’re here to find the f*****g girl who’ll f*****g stick’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Well, I won’t be sticking with Love Island. Those of us who think civilisation as we knew it ended long ago do not need this depressing bit of TV to confirm our hunches.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>I’d prefer to call it ‘HATE ISLAND’</strong></p><img id="i-90b767a815677303" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/21/4D0FD74000000578-5822853-Nigel_Warburton_philosopher_and_former_senior_lecturer_at_the_Op-m-53_1528490610319.jpg" height="437" width="306" alt="Nigel Warburton, philosopher and former senior lecturer at the Open University" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Nigel Warburton, philosopher and former senior lecturer at the Open University</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Philosophers try to distinguish appearance from reality, so for me it’s amusing to watch a ‘reality’ show that is almost all about appearances.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The participants are obsessed with how they come across: which bikini or shirt to wear, how pumped their muscles are. One even blow-dries her false eyelashes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They all know they are being watched by millions of viewers, so the result is that nothing seems real. When the contestants speak, it’s as if they have half-learned a banal script full of cliches.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Only rarely do lines come from the heart — and when they do, I have the uncomfortable feeling that those speaking them have been manipulated into a state of emotional turmoil because it makes for better TV. Do the directors cheer when one of the participants cries?

Today, we have Love Island, which is basically Big Brother in the sunshine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What makes the contestants freakish is that they have beautiful, buffed bodies — if you don’t mind tattoos, piercings, enhanced lips and man-buns.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The girls and boys are like models in a cheap glossy magazine come to life — one of those magazines you flick through without finding anything to read.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They spend hours posing, lolling, lounging and preening.

If this lot are in an asylum, it is because they suffer from extreme narcissism.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Encounters between the males and the females are entirely based on looks, on immediate reactions, like dogs and bitches let out of their kennels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The language they use is a kind of semi-articulate growling and whimpering.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The programme has a soft- porn appeal. It is titillating for viewers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the build-up to any action is agonising, as when zoologists wait years for giant pandas to mate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, I would say that the show is anthropological.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you watch this tribe for long enough, although the youngsters seem to be making dramas out of nothing, in fact, rich tales of intrigue, flattery, flirtation and deceit develop.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>I see parallels with Shakespeare</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Dr Sally Bayley, language expert and Fellow of the Rothermere American Institute, Oxford University</strong></p><img id="i-d8229c9d816937a2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/21/4D0FD71000000578-5822853-image-a-60_1528490688080.jpg" height="381" width="306" alt="Dr Sally Bayley, language expert and Fellow of the Rothermere American Institute, Oxford University" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">These bronzed, bragging twentysomethings talk big, fantasise and ego-strut.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The whole premise of the show reminds me of a Shakespearean play — it’s similar to the messy romance Troilus And Cressida, which is set during the Trojan war. In the play, all the courtship is done by the go-between figure, Pandarus, on behalf of the hapless young Troilus. On Love Island, the go-between is the prying TV camera as well as the other contestants.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Flirtation becomes a consumer sport. Everyone gets involved with the ludicrous language games played by these silly infants competing for sexual attention.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, the language they use is childish. (One contestant, 23-year-old Coventry construction worker Niall Aslam, even has a Harry Potter-inspired tattoo.)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The contestants are kids who seem to want a Marvel comic-book version of a partner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sadly, it is clear they are from a generation who see romance as just a commodity. They view people as ‘things’ and exaggerate everything. The word ‘literally’ is peppered everywhere, especially when recounting an encounter with the opposite sex that is blatantly a fantasy.</p><img id="i-3cebde452f4fe1f5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/21/4D0DCBD800000578-5822853-image-a-66_1528490907214.jpg" height="357" width="634" alt="'Absurdly, they are also obsessed with what they call ‘grafting’ — modern-speak for a man trying to get a woman to like him by making a meek attempt at flirting'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Absurdly, they are also obsessed with what they call ‘grafting’ — modern-speak for a man trying to get a woman to like him by making a meek attempt at flirting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the case of 27-year-old A&amp;E doctor Alex George, ‘grafting’ just means putting on a nice shirt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The contestants also frequently refer to being ‘nice’, although the show is far from it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, originally there were more boys than girls, which meant one lad, Adam, had to steal a girl, Kendall. Air hostess Laura even wears a T-shirt to bed with the logo ‘Be Nice’ across her chest. She discusses being nice while lying in bed with Wes, who in turn tells her she is ‘sweet’. Neither means what they say.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Bayley’s memoir Girl With Dove: A Life Built By Books, is published by William Collins, £14.99.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>It has the allure of a greek drama</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Professor Tim Whitmarsh, Cambridge University classicist</strong></p><img id="i-60cbda2b6167306f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/21/4D0FD71400000578-5822853-image-a-62_1528490707340.jpg" height="360" width="306" alt="Professor Tim Whitmarsh, Cambridge University classicist" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">This may sound perverse, but I believe Love Island is not just eye candy: it puts a modern spin on themes that are deeply rooted in the Ancient World.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">First, the beautiful bodies. In statues, vases and the wall-paintings of Pompeii, the young, sensual, toned flesh of the gods and mortals was celebrated by the Ancient Greeks and Romans.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s no coincidence that when Niall complains about feeling threatened by Adam Collard, a hunky, 6ft 5in Geordie personal trainer, he says: ‘He looks like a f*****g Greek god… he looks like f*****g Zeus sh****d Angelina Jolie.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there is the island setting. The idea of a ‘love island’ — a place of allure but also of danger — is a profoundly Greek one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Mediterranean islands deeply influenced the Ancient Greeks’ literary imagination. In Homer’s Odyssey, for example, the warrior is offered mind-bending drugs on one island; on another, the beautiful goddess Calypso promises him immortality if he will become her lover.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As with all Greek drama, the audience sees its own anxieties reflected in the spectacle. As viewers, we experience the contestants’ jealousy, hope and rejection. Also, we understand how relationships can change very quickly. In the case of this TV series, the modern-day equivalent of the Gods (TV producers) will intervene to raise up the meek and bring down the arrogant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ultimately, the message of Love Island is a profoundly Greek one: that while we have little control over the events life will throw at us, we can hope best to succeed by sticking to our principles and playing the long game.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tim Whitmarsh is a professor of Greek Culture at the University of Cambridge and author of Dirty Love: The Genealogy Of The Ancient Greek Novel</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Is it love... or just putting it about?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Canon Brian Mountford, a chaplain at Oxford University</strong></p><img id="i-b101def04ce94c34" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/21/4D0FD71800000578-5822853-image-a-64_1528490722158.jpg" height="360" width="306" alt="Canon Brian Mountford, a chaplain at Oxford University" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Christianity, the essence of God is love. When I speak at weddings, I emphasise three aspects of love: eros, that driven, sexual love the marriage service celebrates; friendship; and agape (pronounced agapay) or self-giving love, which involves being inclusive and trying to empathise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The title of Love Island forces the question of what love really is. Is it just putting it about?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My biggest concern arose when two new girls — Georgia Steel, 20, a part-time barmaid, and Rosie Williams, 26, a part-time model — were introduced.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This made the other women aggressively territorial and the men more predatory. Indicating his willingness to change partner, one man said: ‘We’re on Love Island, not f*****g Loyalty Island.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I found something sinister in the manipulation of the participants, but was encouraged by signs of moral resilience seeping through in their self-analysis.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">For Friends superfans, there's good news, and there's bad news.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Speaking on a panel for <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thewrap.com/friends-reunion-will-never-happen-co-creator-david-crane-ross-rachel-still-together-exclusive/">The Wrap</a>'s Emmy series this week, one of the show's creators, David Crane, 60, spoke about the fate of beloved couple Ross and Rachel after the series wrapped in 2004.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Without even having to think about it, Crane revealed that the lovebirds would most certainly still be together if the show picked up again today — but fans shouldn't get their hopes up for any sort of reunion.</p><img id="i-5f5787722f97debc" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/14/4D0D955000000578-0-image-a-1_1528464580256.jpg" height="966" width="634" alt="Not on a break!

Do you think that's sustainable?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ross and Rachel had dated off and on throughout the show, and went on to have a daughter named Emma. Some of the major drama of the series finale hinged on whether the couple would end up together — which they did.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And Crane promised that they'd still be together today, despite some of their struggles.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Yes. Come on, they worked really hard, ten years,' he said. Crane added that Chandler and Monica are 'absolutely' still together too.</p><div>

A graphic anal rape scene in the second season has prompted backlash, but Devin insisted it wouldn't have been fair to 'censor' it. 'We can't sugarcoat it or censor it at all because that's not how these events happen. And I think it is this trying to portray and make people understand what happens in these unfortunate and tragic circumstances,' he said in an interview in Hollywood earlier this week.

Kristy Goodwin, originally from Perth but now lives in Queensland, suffered from a binge eating disorder for most part of her life. She overindulged on copious amounts of food because she never felt satisfied - and she was unable to stop herself from eating - a lifestyle that saw her tip the scales at 117kg at her heaviest. But she was determined to get on top of her weight once and for all, she made a drastic lifestyle overhaul that helped her shed 43kg. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, the gym instructor - who now looks unrecognisable - shared her incredible body transformation after she overcame her crippling condition.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Cindy Tran</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-08T05:50:10.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Woman who weighed 117kg, speaks out about her binge eating disorder</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-08T05:50:10.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5815591/Amber-Luke-23-shares-transformation-getting-10-000-body-art.html" title="Woman, 23, shares her incredible transformation after spending more than $10,000 on her body art, including a split tongue and blue tattoos on her EYEBALLS that could have blinded her"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5819109/Is-BLACK-TEA-secret-weight-loss-good-gut-health.html" title="Is BLACK TEA the secret to weight loss?

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Peter Stringfellow, aka, Stringy, 'King of Clubs', lap-dancing supremo, gold lamé enthusiast and possessor of one of the worst mullets in the history of hair, has died, aged 77, leaving four children aged between three and 55, and a beautiful 35-year-old widow, Bella, who loved him with all her heart.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During an epic career he made (and lost and made again) tens of millions of pounds, and welcomed rock stars, film stars, politicians and sportsmen at his chain of 'Gentlemen's' clubs in the UK and U.S.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He partied with everyone from Jack Nicholson to Andy Warhol and <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/diana/index.html" id="mol-63f29a90-6aa2-11e8-86d4-8b8deeda1da3">Princess Diana</a> to Stephen Hawking (yes, really).</p><img id="i-e20d4b0d30e3b071" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/23/4D07459900000578-5819049-image-a-1_1528410286127.jpg" height="634" width="634" alt="The ultimate showman: Peter with Bella and their children in 2015 " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, of course, he was obsessed with sex. By his own estimate he slept with more than 2,000 women. Sometimes, he would have sex with just one woman, perhaps in his lavish apartment which had a copy of Botticelli's Venus on the ceiling, or they'd splish-splash about in his vast, gold Jacuzzi.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More often he 'entertained' them in groups of two and three.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Goodness knows where he got the energy. But on a diet of vodka with just a splash of tonic, ever-flowing Krug champagne and a regular bedtime of 5.30am, he managed to keep up the pace.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He didn't smoke or take drugs, and he was never ashamed of showing off his teeny white buttocks in his favourite lime green G-string as he strolled hand in hand along Barbados beaches with a parade of nubile young girls barely out of school.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No wonder then, that in 2000 when Stringfellow started 'dating' Bella — then a 19-year-old professional ballet dancer whose real name was Elaine — her father blew his top. He wouldn't speak to his daughter's new 'boyfriend' for at least a year.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The romance started when Bella — Peter called her that because she is half Italian — popped into Stringfellows with some friends after a performance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was lovely, talented and, most of all, in his eyes she was 'pure'. From his vast gold and leopard-skin throne in the Covent Garden club, Peter spotted her in an instant, sent over vintage champagne and spent the next three months trying — and eventually succeeding — to woo her into his bed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A 41-year age gap was never going to worry a man like Stringfellow — he'd been dating progressively younger women as the years wore on, deaf to those who dismissed him as a sleazy old man.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But everyone else wondered what the beautiful teenager saw in an ageing playboy with a terrible fashion sense and a reputation that would scare off even Miss Whiplash.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It was his charm,' she once said. 'He was so charming, so gentle, and loving. He's a really special man.</p><img id="i-90584960c57c86fe" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/23/4D0745BD00000578-5819049-image-a-2_1528410293987.jpg" height="461" width="634" alt="Peter Stringfellow and guests attend Peter Stringfellow's 65th birthday party at his club, Stringfellows in London" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He's kind to everyone he meets. He's not what you read in the Press. He's very gentlemanly and hates crudeness and swearing.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, for all his lewd public image and autocratic management style, in the surprisingly well-toned flesh, Stringfellow could be an absolute delight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Charming, twinkly and youthful (thanks to an extremely good facelift, a penchant for £150-per-pot La Prairie moisturiser and manicures), he was also rather prone to inconsistencies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For starters, as well as his distaste for crudity and swearing, particularly by women, he loathed porn ('quite disgusting'), the institution of Page 3 and excessive ladette behaviour. 'All this drinking and sleeping around. Girls don't want to do that, do they?' he once said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite the millions he made from women sharing their naked bodies with onlookers, and the thousands of naked bodies he enjoyed himself, he remained surprisingly prudish, claiming to have a 'Cliff Richard mentality' (though presumably without the religion).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The world has gone sex mad!' he once complained. 'I don't want to open my paper and see girls with their boobs out! I am shocked by it!' Hypocrisy? Taking the mick? Quite possibly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But his senior staff, the dancers he employed and his wide group of friends loved him and raved about his loyalty, kindness and generosity.</p><img id="i-e34848bbbdde6d4d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/23/4D07459E00000578-5819049-image-a-3_1528410296498.jpg" height="954" width="634" alt="Peter Stringfellow poses with his and girlfriend in 1996" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a staunch Tory, that group included the late Baroness Thatcher, David Cameron, George Osborne and Jeffrey and Mary Archer who lived in the flat above him in Westminster.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was on good terms with his two ex-wives and remained pals with his endless girlfriends, all of whom he had met in the club and most of whom returned to their jobs as dancers when their 'special time' with him was up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Peter Stringfellow was clever, too — with a pile of highbrow books by his bed that he actually read — and cultured. He loved the ballet, was fascinated by ancient civilisations, obsessed with politics and adored science.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the late Stephen Hawking visited his club, Stringfellow famously tried to engage him in an intellectual discussion about cosmic string theory (of course), only to be batted away by Hawking's: 'No, I'm here for the girls! The girls!'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But most of all, Stringfellow was driven.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He was like a man possessed,' says Roger Howe, one of his managers who had known him for 50 years. 'Very focused, very motivated, very meticulous and very driven by getting more, getting away from his very poor background.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Peter Stringfellow was born in Sheffield on October 17, 1940, the eldest of four brothers. His father was a steelworker, but money was tight and they didn't have a proper bathroom — something Peter admitted he later compensated for by filling every bathroom he owned with gold-plated baths, TVs and champagne on ice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His parents were deeply prudish. He never saw his father naked and sex was never discussed. Even when his mother was hugely pregnant with one of his brothers, she never let on she was carrying a baby inside, let alone how it had got there.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A predominantly male household and an all-boys school meant that for the young Stringfellow, girls were a mystery — exotic creatures, that he put on pedestals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He left school at 15 after an unimpressive scholastic career (he was dyslexic but good at maths). Next came a two-month stint in the Merchant Navy (which he hated), a job in a bakery (where he met a girl called Norma, married her and almost immediately started sleeping with her cousin), followed by a job as a door-to-door salesman and eight weeks in prison for stealing carpets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On his release, he had sex with his pregnant wife in the back of a car while his dad sat in the front, eyes firmly on the road.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His next foray was into rock'n'roll. He held his first hop in a church hall renamed the Black Cat Club in Sheffield in 1962.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it was as he stood on stage for the first time, spotlight on him, microphone in hand, that everything changed. Finally, he had found his calling and the girls came flocking. He made love to one of them in the back of his van that very first night. And every night after.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By the time his daughter, Karen, was born, his business — soon he was promoting The Beatles, The Kinks, the Rolling Stones and Fleetwood Mac — and sex life were taking off in tandem. Conveniently, he never considered it infidelity on the basis he wasn't bothered about the conquests.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Until, that is, he met Coral who gave birth to their son, Scott, in January 1966. She became wife No. 2 in August 1966 and, immediately after the wedding ceremony, he left to DJ at a club in Nottingham, had sex with a woman from the crowd, before driving back to Sheffield to consummate the marriage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And so it went on . . . conquest after conquest. He once said the secret to monogamy was lying.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, his empire was growing — clubs in Leeds, Manchester and eventually, after borrowing £1 million, Stringfellow's in London in 1980.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It may be regarded as naff now, but at the time, Stringfellow's was properly cool and packed with celebrities, including Marvyn Gaye, Rod Stewart and Eddie Murphy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Everyone who was anyone went there, with Stringfellow lording it in the middle on his gold throne — the best connected man in London and, according to his staff and dancing 'angels', a delight to work for.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He ran a very tight ship, used to joke that his clubs were run 'with more rules than Westminster' (including a strict no-touching rule for his dancers). In 1996, he introduced lap-dancing to the UK and, in 2002, applied for a 'full nudity' licence from Westminster Council and got it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was Stringfellow's and he adored working. But eventually, even he began to slow down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In one interview he admitted he'd had to cut back a bit: 'My appetite now can satisfy one lady and that's enough,' he said. 'The effort in running two or three girls is just too much . . .'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Enough!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was at about this time that he met Bella. Her father's reaction wasn't helped by the unfortunate coincidence of how he found out about his daughter's new love in the first place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bella was back at home one weekend when Peter, characteristically over-refreshed, slipped as he grabbed a bottle of Vina Sol from the fridge in his Majorcan villa and phoned her in distress. She told her parents she had to fly to Spain because her boyfriend had dislocated his shoulder.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Naturally, they were sympathetic and supportive — until an hour later when they were watching the news and Peter's face popped up with the announcement he'd dislocated his shoulder in Majorca.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bella's dad turned grey. Who can blame him? But fast forward 18 years and, astonishingly, Bella and Peter were still together, married for nine years, utterly faithful and still so besotted they'd leave little love notes around the apartment for each other.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's a big decision to start a family in your 70s, when you already wear a hearing aid and know you're unlikely to see your children grow up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But particularly in Peter's case because in 2009, just months after their Barbados wedding, he was diagnosed with lung cancer, and had most of a lung and a couple of ribs removed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">(Bella dressed up in a skimpy Agent Provocateur nurse's outfit to remove his stitches and mop his brow.) They went ahead and in 2013 Rosabella was born. Angelo followed two years later. Peter was completely obsessed with his new family.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He did the school run. He changed nappies. He talked about his children constantly, photographed them, watched videos of them. He became a 'new' man. And, perhaps inevitably, he tried to rewrite history.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After years of going on (and on) about his epic sex life, he suddenly refused to discuss his hedonistic years, as though they'd never happened. 'As far as I'm concerned, the past is the past. Gone,' he'd say very firmly. 'Other than my own family past and my success with the business, of course.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Presumably he was trying to protect Bella, but she had her own explanation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think he just wasn't with the right person [before]. I met him towards the end of his crazy lifestyle.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After some years in remission, sadly, Stringfellow's cancer returned last year. He was taken ill on the way home from a holiday in Italy last summer and rushed to hospital where he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was clear to everyone around him that this was the beginning of the end, but for months he fought hard, refusing to give up on his young family, hoping he'd live long enough for his children to remember him and reminding Bella over and over that she must get on with her life and find love again.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Peter Stringfellow, aka, Stringy, 'King of Clubs', lap-dancing supremo, gold lamé enthusiast and possessor of one of the worst mullets in the history of hair, has died, aged 77, leaving four children aged between three and 55, and a beautiful 35-year-old widow, Bella (left), who loved him with all her heart.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">You may have tried the 5:2 diet at some point in a bid to slim down, but sticking to a restricted diet on the two fast days arguably requires more willpower than simply eating less on a daily basis. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-afbbac80-6a45-11e8-a437-adc0e65aebf4">London</a>-based <span style="font-size: 16px;">hypnotherapist and personal trainer Rory Z. Fulcher has combined the principles of hypnosis and fasting for the first time in his <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://geni.us/hypno">new book</a> - and he believes the two are ideal bedfellows when it comes to losing weight.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">His book, a number one Kindle bestseller in diet and weight loss, explains why introducing hypnotherapy techniques makes this different from simply following the 5:2 diet. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> Rory told Femail: 'Rather than just relying on hypnotic suggestions for weight management, which can be very effective, it merges these hypnotic techniques with 'intermittent fasting', which is a tried-and-tested, scientifically proven 'eating schedule'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Fasting alone is amazing for fat-burning, but by combining it with hypnosis you can change your mindset and beliefs in order to improve your willpower and to boost weight loss motivation and get the most out of it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His book is full of mental tricks and strategies drawn from hypnosis that will help to keep you on track. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Read on to find out how quirky tricks such as clicking a pen for several minutes and brushing your teeth right after dinner can aid your weight loss success.</p><img id="i-46030a8dbd4d013b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/17/4CFBAB9A00000578-5813389-image-a-60_1528304175902.jpg" height="475" width="634" alt="London-based hypnotherapist Rory Z.

Leave yourself a note where you sit, reminding you to sit up straight. Each time you notice it, and you're not still sitting up, use your willpower to do so for as long as you can. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can also set yourself time-based tasks such as brushing your teeth mindfully for two minutes, focusing on no other thoughts or distractions. How about doing a monotonous activity for as long as you can, such as clicking a pen or squeezing a ball. </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox femail floatRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-14ee7660-6a45-11e8-a437-adc0e65aebf4">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">How to do intermittent fasting </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The full-timer plan</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eat for 8 hours, fast for 16, repeat every day</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is probably the best choice for a consistent, effective intermittent fasting solution. This idea is that you set yourself a daily 'eating window' and keep it consistent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The most popular choice is usually 12 noon until 8pm or thereabouts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aim for one or two meals during your seating window, cut the snacks and consume no food or calorific drinks during the fasting period. Only water or black tea or coffee count.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The best tip would be to aim for high-protein foods, because protein is great at making us feel fuller. Another great way to fill yourself up is to choose high-fibre foods; whole wheat bread and pasta, brown rice, beans, nuts, pulses, porridge, fruit and vegetables </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The 50 per cent plan</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eat normally for one day. Eat 500 to 600 calories the next, alternate continuously.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For this plan it's recommended that you use your calories in a maximum of two meals. The less feeding times the better. Anything over three, including small meals or snacks, and you body can switch back to fat storing mode. One could be 500 calories and the to her 11, or however you'd prefer to balance the scales</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The weekender plan</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eat normally for five days, east 500 to 600 calories for two days, repeat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This plan is great for all of you folks who have such drastically, mind-bendingly busy lives that your weekends or whichever two consecutive days you're not working are the only days that you are able to modify your hectic schedule. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">These work well because as well as the time element your muscles will start to ache too, so it's a real test of mind over matter. Perhaps you could challenge yourself to use your non dominant hand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Do confront your reflection</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you look at yourself in the mirror every day, front view and side on you'll get to learn what your body looks like, and when you start making progress with your chosen plan, you'll much more easily notice how different you look with less fat. Looking in the mirror at your excess fat gives you a physical enemy, your arch-nemesis personified. Your fat is your enemy and seeing your enemy gradually disappear is the best feeling there is.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Banish cravings </strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are craving something, don't immediately give in to your impulses. Make yourself wait for 20 to 30 minutes. Anyone can wait for 20 minutes, and by simply doing that, you'll usually knock that internal feeling on the head and that's all it is, a feeling. It's not an addiction-craving. You are not addicted to cakes. So re-frame the way you refer to these feelings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Give yourself an end point </strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When you finish a TV show, you know it's done because the credits roll and the adverts come on. We like things to have a definitive ending, a closing point. Something that shows us that this thing we're doing has now finished. So how do you know when you've finished eating? What's stopping you from continuing your eating session beyond this meal or beyond the dessert, munching away into the night. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A great way to end your day's eating is by brushing your teeth just after your evening meal. This is your 'The End'. Once you've brushed your teeth you have closed your 'eating loop for the day. We as humans love it when 'loops' close and if that closure doesn't happen we get agitated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Learn to hate trigger foods  </strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have a type of food that you'd really like to stop eating, but you can't manage to do it by sheer willpower alone, then you can use a psychological technique known as aversion therapy. </p><img id="i-6820f62cbb185fe9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/12/4D01460600000578-5813389-image-a-10_1528370010166.jpg" height="494" width="306" alt="Rory's bestselling book reveals how hypnotherapy techniques can boost your diet " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Think about some food, drink or substance that absolutely disgusts you. It could be sprouts or the grossest bodily fluid you can imagine. Then imagine taking the chips or whatever you want to stop eating them and covering them in the gross substance. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Imagine bringing the chip up to your mouth, smelling the stench of it, feeling the smell already clinging to the back of your nose and throat and then imagine putting it in your mouth and trying not to vomit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now stop, clear your mind and take a deep refreshing breath of air. Repeat this process in your imagination a number of times and connect to is as vividly as you can. This is a tried-and-tested therapy technique and one that hypnotherapists use frequently in their sessions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Keep positive focus </strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Actively focusing on negative things gives them power. Don't keep thinking 'I won't eat that cake in the cupboard' over and over. Focus instead on what you do want, such as: 'I'm going to fast until 2pm today'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then you'll still be achieving the 'won't eat the cake thing, but without needing to think about it directly. Taking away any negative focus and replacing it with something more positive to focus upon will often make your life a lot easier.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>London-based hypnotherapist and personal trainer Rory Z.

'But never try to ask him a third question, or he'll kill you.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Adam was confronted again with David in his dreams soon after and questioned him about how he died, learning it was an accident in a store that saw someone push a shelf onto his head. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He mistakenly asked a third question before waking up petrified. He researched online looking for boys who died in stores in the city but found nothing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Adam eventually moved into a larger apartment upstairs from his own and months went by without any sight nor sign of Dear David until suddenly his cats began acting strangely.</p><div>

He also shared a video of one of his cats staring intently at his front door.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A few weeks later, Adam began another thread explaining various strange things that have been happening to him, including a dream 'where David was dragging me by the arm through an old abandoned warehouse.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He woke up with a large bruise on his arm, but assumed that it was the injury that sparked the dream, rather than the other way around. </p><img id="i-b42a43454600978d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/13/20/474CF42600000578-5176413-image-m-23_1513197693316.jpg" height="427" width="306" alt="Audience: Adam now has more than one million followers on his Twitter account" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But then on his way to get coffee he passed a usually busy warehouse that had suddenly been abandoned.

I closed all the curtains in my apartment and turned on every single light. I watched TV until dawn because I was too scared to go to sleep.

He angled his flashlight all around and finally saying, "There's nothing up here," ' Adam recounted. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But then he was like, "Oh, wait." I watched as he reached up into the emptiness with his free arm, and when he pulled it back he had something small and round in his hand. He climbed down the ladder and handed it to me.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The item was a marble, which Adam said had 'a little bump on one end'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'My landlord seemed unbothered for the most part (uhhh ok dude) and he told me to call him if I heard anything else. I went inside and headed to my office to see if I could figure anything out about this marble that somehow made its way into my ceiling,' he added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Adam hasn't been able to figure out much about where the shoe and the marble might have come from, and remains thoroughly confused as to the unexpected happenings that he says keep unfolding in and around his apartment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Earlier last month, Adam shared images of what he said was Dear David staring at him and shuffling towards him in his bedroom.</p><img id="i-2a7ad6d896529704" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/13/12/464DE7E100000578-5077317-image-m-7_1510576515797.jpg" height="502" width="306" alt="Spooky:  Adam also shared images of what he said was Dear David staring at him and shuffling towards him in his bedroom" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-36130d034e46dd51" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/13/12/464DE81600000578-5077317-image-a-8_1510576525142.jpg" height="502" width="306" alt="Spooky:  Adam also shared images of what he said was Dear David staring at him and shuffling towards him in his bedroom" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's been about four months since the first time I dreamed of David,' he tweeted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Last night I dreamed about him again.

I didn't want to look at the rest of the photos, but I knew I had to.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Our bedrooms should be sanctuaries: places to rest and wake feeling restored. Indeed, they’re where we spend 36 per cent of our lives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But experts say they are often packed with worrying chemicals and microbes. What’s more, during sleep, our systems are switched to healing and repair, rather than defence — meaning our bodies are at their most vulnerable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, is your safe space harming your health?</p><img id="i-11c4190055abc0c9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/22/4CFD28F000000578-5813595-image-a-1_1528321670963.jpg" height="474" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>CHEMICAL DUST FROM YOUR MATTRESS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Every mattress comes with a flame-retardant label guaranteeing that it’s safe in a blaze. But many experts fear treatments used to make mattresses fire-safe, or to prevent fungus growing, involve a number of health-endangering chemicals and even carcinogens.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">David Gale, of Gale &amp; Snowden, an eco-architecture firm based in Devon, says: ‘These chemicals can leach out into the dust in your room and you breathe them in. We don’t yet know what are the long-term consequences.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your best defence is to keep your bedroom as dust-free as possible and well-ventilated.</p><div>


</div><img id="i-2fe6a8e1d00c86af" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/23/4CFD72C500000578-5813595-image-a-9_1528323611122.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="Experts fear that treatments used to make mattresses fire-safe, or to prevent fungus growing, involve a number of health-endangering  carcinogens" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>CARPETS TO BLAME FOR ASTHMA</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s nothing better than sinking your feet into a deep-pile carpet when you spring out of bed on a chilly morning . . . until you read a report published last year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It concluded: ‘The use of carpets is linked to increased levels of indoor dusts, allergens and microorganisms, and is associated with increased risk of a number of health outcomes, including mild cognitive effects, irritative symptoms and asthma.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The biggest culprits are dust mites — specifically their waste — which can cause allergic reactions. Wooden floors are a better option, but if you insist on soft carpet in the bedroom, you should vacuum regularly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The more allergic you are, the more you have to do it,’ says Dr Lisa Ackerley of TheHygiene Doctor.co.uk. ‘You may want to clean every day if it makes a difference to your health.’ Consider a professional steam clean at least once a year, too — more frequently if you have a pet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>FUNGUS GROWING IN YOUR PILLOWS</strong></p><img id="i-78d758e176d5f3a8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/23/4CFD730700000578-5813595-image-a-7_1528323427105.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="A University of Manchester study found that a normal pillow contains a substantial amount of many species of fungi" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ready to rest your head? You may have unwelcome bedfellows. A University of Manchester study found that ‘the typical used pillow contains a substantial amount of many species of fungi’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Spores of these are in the air, but it’s only when they find a warm, damp place that they can grow — so pillows and duvets are ideal. The study concluded that this has ‘important implications for patients with respiratory disease, especially asthma and sinusitis’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Grubby pillows and duvets can also exacerbate acne, spots and other types of skin inflammation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To minimise fungus growth, dry your hair before bed, air pillows and duvets in sunlight once a week and replace your pillows at least every two years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>LIGHT BULBS THAT CAUSE SKIN DAMAGE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Using energy-efficient fluorescent bulbs in your bedroom? They could harm your skin and even keep you up at night. A study in the British Journal of Dermatology showed a type of energy-saving bulb known as compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) emits ultraviolet light, which can cause skin damage and redness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">David Gale — who is also the co-founder of the Building Biology Association (building biology.co.uk), a group that aims to improve the health of our living spaces — says these bulbs sometimes flicker imperceptibly, too, which can cause headaches.</p><img id="i-bcd1163aaa7d42dd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/23/4CFD732100000578-5813595-image-a-8_1528323596989.jpg" height="417" width="634" alt="Energy-efficient fluorescent bulbs could harm your skin and may even keep you up at night" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">And because they give off blue light, they can even stop us sleeping. ‘In the evening, our bodies are used to red-based light from the setting sun,’ he says. ‘That triggers the release of the sleep hormone melatonin, which helps us nod off. Whereas blue light is the sort of light you get from the sun at midday.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He recommends looking for tungsten filament bulbs, which give off a warmer light that doesn’t flicker as much, or the newer LED energy-efficient lights which flicker less — and don’t seem to give off UV light.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>FURNITURE MAKES YOUR EYES ‘BURN’</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unless your bedroom is full of antique furniture, inevitably you will have MDF or chipboard somewhere. The problem is that these synthetic forms of wood are essentially, as David Gale puts it, ‘dust or small bits of timber stuck together with a lot of glue, which often contains formaldehyde’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Short-term exposure to high levels of formaldehyde has been associated with burning sensations in the eyes, nose and throat, as well as respiratory issues, and it is also a known carcinogen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Gale is so concerned about it that he has described MDF as ‘the asbestos of tomorrow’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, worryingly, these types of ‘fake wood’ can continue to give off gases for ten to 20 years, even if painted. They might seem like the cheap and cheerful option, but it’s far better to buy solid timber.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>PHONE CHARGERS DISRUPTING SLEEP</strong></p><img id="i-de4a28b57bf456fc" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/23/4CFD72E300000578-5813595-image-a-10_1528323624494.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Some people may find it hard to get a deeper sleep if they’re resting next to a charging phone or an electric alarm clock" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Our nervous system operates on very low voltage electricity,’ says David Gale. ‘Our brains use electricity to send messages to our muscles. For some people, the man-made alternating current that powers our homes can interfere with these processes.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says such people may find it hard to get a deeper sleep if they’re resting next to a charging phone or an electric alarm clock. If you’re affected, before you go to bed, try flipping the fuse box switches that power the lights and sockets in your bedroom to see if this helps.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>PAINT SOLVENTS ARE A REAL HEADACHE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">David Gale says paints often use solvents, which, when they evaporate and are inhaled, can cause dizziness, headaches and even impaired brain function.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As we spend a third of our lives in the bedroom, mostly breathing deeply while asleep, we’re at our most vulnerable here.</p><img id="i-a245d51e0bf569e5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/23/4CFD736200000578-5813595-image-a-11_1528323636094.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Paints often use solvents, which, when they evaporate and are inhaled, can cause dizziness" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Try using water-based paints containing casein [a milk protein used since Egyptian times], clay and lime, which are environmentally friendly and healthy,’ he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">See mikewye.co.uk for a range of natural paints.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WINDOWS HARM THE IMMUNE SYSTEM</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Condensation on your double glazing leads to mould growth — and that’s bad news. According to NHS Choices, ‘if you have damp and mould, you’re more likely to have respiratory problems, respiratory infections, allergies or asthma. Damp and mould can also affect the immune system’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Triple-glazed windows, which beat the condensation problem, are an option. Or try a dehumidifier — the Meaco brand (from £179.99, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://fave.co/2sL2zun">johnlewis.com</a>) is highly rated. A cheaper option is crystals that absorb water from the air (from £4.29, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://fave.co/2kTZGUf">lakeland.co.uk</a>).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>RADIATORS HEAT UP THE PROBLEMS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How could a radiator be a health hazard? The answer lies in the dust that collects behind it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Dust is obviously bad for you if you breathe it in,’ says David Gale, ‘but it also attracts moisture, which can then dissolve any volatile compounds that it comes into contact with — such as the formaldehyde in MDF — so when you inhale dust, you also inhale hazardous compounds.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Radiators heat the air, which rises and spreads dust around.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Keep them well dusted to minimise the problem.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Our bedrooms should be sanctuaries, especially as we spend 36 per cent of our lives inside them.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">When it comes to make-up, it’s tit for tat in our house. Thanks to my job as a beauty editor, my girls Molly and Beth have always known that my office is the place to raid for expensive pieces of make-up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what they don’t know is that — when I’m on the hunt for a new product — I’ll sneak a peek at their make-up stash.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Teenagers don’t usually take make-up too seriously. They see the cosmetics aisle as a huge playground and are keen to experiment. It’s an attitude we tend to forget when we’re older. But best of all — these products can be less than £5. A mascara doesn’t have to cost £20 to give a high-end result.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Often you are paying for the expensive packaging on pricey mascaras,’ says make-up artist Wendy Snowdon, who works with celebrities and on film sets. Wendy believes cheap products are great for encouraging women to step outside their make-up comfort zone.</p><img id="i-1f827c5f5113e60d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/20/4CFC473100000578-5813621-image-m-2_1528315140086.jpg" height="474" width="634" alt="British beauty expert Alice-Hart Davis revealed the best inexpensive cosmetics for giving this season's bright colour make-up trend a go (file image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There’s a big trend for bright colour this summer — and teen brands are an inexpensive way of having a go,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many brands also have websites with videos on how to use the products. So here’s my pick of the products worth adding to your make-up bag . . .</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>FLATTERING BLUSHER</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sleek Makeup is an innovative brand with its finger on the pulse of make-up trends, which has helped to make it one of the fastest-growing cosmetics companies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Skip past the palettes of rose-gold highlighter powders and instead try the Cream to Powder blush in French Rose (£5.99).</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Stick with a cream blush,’ advises Wendy. ‘It’s easier to manage than powder for older, drier skin and gives a more flattering result.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Or choose the colourful Twist-Up eye pencils (£2.99) to try out this summer’s brighter-eyes trends (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://fave.co/2xW4D8m">sleekmakeup.com</a>).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>STAY-PUT LIPSTICK</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most beauty-obsessed teens have some Revolution products in their collection because they deliver impressive colour options at amazing prices.</p><img id="i-7effb4a6eb36e222" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/21/4CFC503D00000578-5813621-image-a-15_1528315345859.jpg" height="638" width="634" alt="Alice says Revolution's Pro Supreme Matte Lip Pigment (pictured)  is ideal for lip gloss that stays in place" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, its Flawless Palettes offer 32 eyeshadow colours for £8, making them some of the best value available. For a slightly more grown-up option, try their Revolution Pro line. Packaged in classy black cases, the felt-tip style Fine Gel Liquid Eyeliner is £4 and perfect for a winged eyeline.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most of all, I’m taken with their Pro Supreme Matte Lip Pigment in a scorching red called Spiritual, also £4, which has a gel formula that stays in place (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://fave.co/2xMJhuo">revolution beauty.com</a>).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>FLAWLESS SKIN</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s all about full-on make-up looks at NYX Cosmetics. Launched over here in Boots in 2014, this cult U.S. brand took the teenage market by storm — they have more than 12 million followers on Instagram. The ‘illuminating powders’ are best left to youngsters, but the brand is strong on what I call ‘make-up support’. ‘The Hydra Touch Primer is £13,’ says Wendy, ‘and it’s as good as products twice its price.’ There’s a good Proof-It Waterproof Eye Shadow Primer, £6, too (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://fave.co/2kVZmVk">nyxcosmetics.co.uk</a>)</p><img id="i-9827f7ea9d2ebbf8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/22/4CFC471500000578-5813621-Make_up_artist_Wendy_recommends_using_products_from_NYX_Cosmetic-a-33_1528320567764.jpg" height="636" width="306" alt="Make-up artist Wendy recommends using products from NYX Cosmetics such as their Hydra Touch Primer (pictured) to support looks" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-3cdf12109d87572f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/22/4CFC471A00000578-5813621-image-a-34_1528320567932.jpg" height="636" width="306" alt="Alice recommends Barry M's Gelly range for everyday manicures" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>PRETTY BRUSHES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In blue, pink or rainbow-coloured, the range of make-up brushes from Spectrum is surely the prettiest on the High Street. Their synthetic fibres also mean they are vegan friendly, a big draw for teens.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I love their So Oval You foundation brush (£7.99) for liquid foundation, and their super-soft Well Rounded brush (£8.99) for adding a light dusting of anti-shine powder. (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://fave.co/2xwv1pv">spectrumcollections.com</a>)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>BRIGHTER EYES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">W7 is a sassy London-based brand with a full range of teen-magnet products, from metallic highlighters to lip glosses. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what appeals to the mid-life eye are the eye shadow palettes, dead ringers for the expensive Urban Decay Naked range that are £39.50 each. Fetchingly styled in rectangular tins, W7 offers 12 eye shadows for just £9.95 (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://fave.co/2BKrpkf">w7cosmetics.co.uk</a>)</p><img id="i-d5062748ac4a7b80" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/10/4D01405F00000578-5813621-The_Colour_me_Buff_Eye_Palette_by_W7_Cosmetics_9_95_is_a_rival_f-a-15_1528362739965.jpg" height="390" width="634" alt="The Colour me Buff Eye Palette by W7 Cosmetics, £9.95, is a rival for Urban Decay's Naked range" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MAGICAL MASCARA</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Italian brand Kiko has stand-alone shops that are an Aladdin’s cave for make-up junkies of any age, though with bargain prices (nail lacquers from £1 and eye shadows from £2.50) many of the clientele are young.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I love the soft, glide-on eye pencils — the black Everlasting Kajal is £5.50 — and the 30 Days Extension Mascara (£7.90) which promises that if you wear it every day its active ingredients will help your eyelashes grow longer over the course of a month (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://fave.co/2kVZsMG">kikocosmetics.com</a>).</p><img id="i-64fc1df7c82f0a26" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/22/4CFC502F00000578-5813621-image-a-32_1528320462794.jpg" height="828" width="634" alt="Alice recommends eye make-up from Kiko (pictured). She revealed the active ingredients in the brand's mascara is able to lengthen lashes" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>CREATIVE NAILS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I challenge your heart not to leap as you stand at a Barry M counter, marvelling at the colours. It takes you back to being a teen. Steer clear of the face jewels and ‘glitter pots’ and try something sensible such as their All Night Long Anti-Redness Primer, £6.99, which has a smoothing effect. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And I adore the bright Nail Paint nail varnishes, though what works better for everyday wear are nudes such as Pink Lemonade or Lychee in the Gelly range (£2.99).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its mascaras are great, too — the Showgirl Extra Lengthening Mascara (£4.99) wakes up tired eyes in an instant (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://fave.co/2sLNQza">barrym.com</a>). </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>British make-up artist Wendy Snowdon revealed bright colour is set to be this summer's biggest make-up trend.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">After a very challenging first birth four years ago that left me with ongoing physical problems, as well as severe enough emotional trauma to make me question whether I would ever want to be pregnant again, I am just two months away from having my second child.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That child, I’ve decided, will be delivered by Caesarean. It’s not a choice I’ve made lightly; I’ve never had an operation before, and honestly, the thought of one terrifies me. But not as much as giving birth ‘naturally’ again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am aware of the risks of surgery. But for me, there are also benefits that far outweigh them, including a much lower risk of worsening my prolapse (a collapse of the internal organs, and a physical condition I still find hard to type or say out loud, aged 36).</p><img id="i-cc9fcd04e0b3c7ef" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/22/4CFBC95800000578-5813733-Natasha_Pearlman_pictured_is_an_ex_magazine_editor_and_is_due_to-a-25_1528319159193.jpg" height="1064" width="634" alt="Natasha Pearlman (pictured) is an ex-magazine editor and is due to give birth in two months for the second time" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">If things get worse for me in that respect, operations to correct the problem can be far more unpleasant than a C-section and take even longer to heal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My reasons for wanting a C-section this time are also psychological after the trauma of my daughter’s birth, a 33-hour labour followed by a forceps delivery. I am almost ashamed to admit that I have cried during every single midwife, physio and consultant appointment I have had this time around.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am, of course, aware of just how lucky I am to have become pregnant again easily and, so far, to have had an uncomplicated seven months. But reliving my first birth time and again, whether it’s through going over my medical notes or being poked or prodded internally, throws me every time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Which is why I am deeply grateful that not only have I felt able to request the birth I feel is right for me, but that I have been listened to and supported by all the professionals I have seen since my very first appointment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But do I, does every woman, have the right to choose the birth we want?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After all, as women, our bodies are designed to give birth. We have been doing it for millennia, and for the vast majority of that time without even the most basic pain relief.</p><img id="i-af14c4dcb84b49bd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/22/4CFBC95300000578-5813733-She_says_that_after_careful_consideration_she_has_decided_that_h-a-26_1528319164405.jpg" height="1141" width="634" alt="She says that, after careful consideration, she has decided that her baby will be delivered by Caesarean" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Globally recognised research spearheaded by the World Health Organisation tells us that — if there are no complications — natural birth means quicker recovery times for the mother and a baby’s first breaths are easier.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With hugely improved hygiene and healthcare provisions, it’s also much safer than it has ever been and many women talk passionately about their almost euphoric experiences of hypno-birthing or water births and other pain-medication-free methods.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am also very aware of the fact that each elective C-section costs the NHS an average £3,781, versus vaginal deliveries at £1,985 — although, of course, the cost of ‘natural’ deliveries can spiral the minute complications set in.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-9505fd50-69cd-11e8-853d-9fc52ef9fa46">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"><span class="femail-ccox">We're not too posh to push, we're too scared </span></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are on average just under 700,000 live births in the UK a year, of which nearly 20 per cent are C-sections (both elective and emergency).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, I am also aware that there are a growing number of women like me who just cannot countenance giving birth ‘naturally’ a second time after what happened during our first labour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’re not ‘too posh to push’ (a phrase I — and I’m sure many other women — resent), but scared. And even more than that, protective of our own bodies. Which may sound controversial and even selfish.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But as women we also need to be able to raise our babies and often, having been through a deep trauma already, we know the only way to do that is by putting our own mental and physical health first.</p><img id="i-818634566692e3f7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/21/4CFBC97000000578-5813733-image-m-11_1528317888448.jpg" height="813" width="634" alt="Louise Davies, pictured, says she is a petite woman and endured what she describes as a ‘barbaric’ assisted delivery" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Medics are all too quick to point out the risks of a Caesarean, but few talk about the damage inflicted by ‘assisted’ births — via forceps, ventouse or episiotomy, where the skin is cut to make way for the baby’s head. Yet statistics show these are increasingly the norm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Virtually every professional I spoke to about this — midwife or doctor — noted that almost all their C-section requests come from women who have suffered previous birth trauma.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That raises the question of whether the fuss over a woman’s right to choose a Caesarean has been unnecessarily exaggerated. Because, while only anecdotal, it does suggest that the majority of women coming into birth the first time round do want to try a natural approach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, more worryingly, it also hints at a bigger problem — that, for far too many women, we’re getting birth so wrong that C-sections are becoming preferable with their second baby, regardless of the risks of major surgery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More than 90 per cent of women who have a vaginal birth suffer a tear or need an episiotomy, and up to half of all women who have children suffer some form of prolapse and may have long-term incontinence problems or need lifelong physio or expensive and complicated surgery to repair the damage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The annual follow-up costs for women who have had the controversial mesh implants to repair their prolapses are a staggering £245 million a year alone. That does not include the costs of the operations or physiotherapy, for which there are no official figures.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Birth Trauma Association estimates that as many as 200,000 women a year suffer from symptoms of post-traumatic stress related to their delivery, while mental health care related to the births in any given year costs the NHS £1.2 billion.</p><img id="i-1358047ff18c42a8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/21/4CFBE7EA00000578-5813733-image-a-7_1528317718866.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="C-sections are becoming the preferred choice for more and more women, regardless of the risks of major surgery (file photo)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘In my experience, a lot of people who request an elective Caesarean section see it as their only way to guarantee that they can’t have a repeat of what has often been an awful experience before,’ concedes Lawrence Impey, a consultant in Obstetrics and Fetal Medicine at Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I think we should regard this as being as much our problem as that of women, and it is a problem we need to address.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Milli Hill, founder of the Positive Birth Movement and author of the Positive Birth Book, tells me: ‘We’re simply not getting birth right. There are too many women having unnecessary interventions. The World Health Organisation states that 80 per cent of women should be able to give birth without intervention, but only around 40 per cent in the UK do.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘So many births are becoming medicalised that we are losing track of what our bodies are actually capable of.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Until we improve the way we “do” natural birth, we should respect women if they choose the option where they feel most in control — which at the moment is Caesarean for many.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I know how traumatic it can be when a woman is not listened to — because I had that with my first, a hospital induction and forceps. I had always wanted a home birth, and because I was being induced (which I hadn’t wanted), I wasn’t allowed.</p><img id="i-26e2568d1f673975" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/21/4CFBC94B00000578-5813733-image-a-10_1528317740427.jpg" height="424" width="634" alt="Experts say that we are 'not getting birth right' as more and more women opt to not have a natural birth (file photo)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It was deeply disempowering and inspired me to start thinking about how to achieve birth in a more positive way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘For my second and third babies I hired private midwives and set up birthing pools in my house. I felt protected, less exposed and I had very powerful and fulfilling experiences.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘And while I really believe that natural birth can and should be made better — and it’s vital we do this — every woman has the right to the birth they feel is right for them.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All too often this is simply not the case, as Louise Davies, 35, a teacher from Berkshire, discovered when she was pregnant with her eldest son Toby, now two.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I’m petite — 5ft 1in tall and a dress size six — so I knew I’d struggle to cope with a vaginal birth when a scan at 36 weeks pregnant estimated that he was already a big baby and likely to weigh around 7lb 7oz.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But when I voiced my concerns to the consultant and asked if I could have a Caesarean, she told me: “No, no, you’ll be fine.” I wasn’t fine.’</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-9d14ac30-69cd-11e8-853d-9fc52ef9fa46">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"><span class="femail-ccox">Birth, full stop, is a risk. And, having weighed up all the options, I wanted my birth to be a controlled risk.</span></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having been induced a week early due to gestational diabetes being diagnosed, Louise endured what she describes as a ‘barbaric’ assisted delivery involving forceps followed by an episiotomy which resulted in a second degree tear. She lost two litres of blood and several months later needed surgery to remove some of the scar tissue.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The consultant who performed the operation told me if I had another baby and wanted an elective Caesarean, he’d give his full support to my choice,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He delivered my second baby, Charlie, by elective Caesarean 13 weeks ago. I felt a lot more in control despite the fact that it’s major surgery and certainly isn’t an easy or pain-free option. After my first experience, I’d never have a vaginal birth again.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Louise was lucky to get this support. In April this year, 21 out of 91 hospital trusts questioned by the Daily Mail admitted that they are refusing women elective Caesareans unless they have a medical reason — against guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) that specifically state: ‘For women requesting a Caesarean section, if after discussion and offer of support, a vaginal birth is still not an acceptable option, offer a planned CS.’</p><img id="i-20a20e7f3840ff7b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/21/4CFBE7D300000578-5813733-image-a-9_1528317731856.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="However, 21 out of 91 hospital trusts questioned by the Daily Mail this year admitted that they are refusing women elective Caesareans unless they have a medical reason (file photo)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rebecca Pendleton, 32, owns a company running children’s events and lives in Staffordshire with her husband Ben, 34, a roofer, and their children Daisy, four, and Arlo, two.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">When you're considering making renovations to your home, often the thought of adding value to the property when it comes to selling can be a deciding factor. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, experts have revealed that while most improvements will increase the potential asking price, the added value is not always greater than what you spend in the first place. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">GoCompare has teamed up with property expert Henry Pryor who is a regular fixture on <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/bbc/index.html" id="mol-e8829ea0-6998-11e8-a660-fd9861a9f977">BBC</a> Breakfast and Radio 4's Today programme, to identify the upgrades that are really worth your money. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His findings reveal that the most profitable home improvement is installing a new boiler for a cost of £2,000 which will add £8,000 in value, making you a profit of £6,000. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Increasing home security and energy saving measures are also worth your while, but updating bathrooms and kitchens and putting in new flooring won't add more value than what you've spent, leaving you at a loss. </p><img id="i-6cf53ba52423b9b8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/15/4CF97CE100000578-0-image-a-51_1528294216052.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="Installing a new boiler is the most profitable addition you can make to your home, adding £8,000 in value for the cost of less than £2,000" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's best therefore that you think carefully why you are spending extra money and who will benefit,' he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'My advice is usually to spend money on the things that you want and leave other improvements to the next person who may not share your taste. </p><div>
