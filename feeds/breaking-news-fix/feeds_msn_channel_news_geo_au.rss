<p class="mol-para-with-font">Kim Jong-un affirmed an 'unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula' in a sign document on Tuesday, President Donald Trump said Tuesday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We're prepared to start a new history, and we're ready to write a new chapter between our two nations,' he told a packed room of reporters at a press conference in Singapore.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program will come to an end, he predicted, noting that Kim had already left Singapore and was on his way home to begin implementing their joint vows. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I believe he's going to live up to that document,' Trump said, adding that 'our eyes are wide open, but peace is always worth the effort, especially in this case.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He wants to do that. This isn't the past. This isn't another administration that never got it started and therefore never got it done.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The president said he had been working around the clock helping to cement the terms of what he hopes will be an iron-clad agreement that Kim will honor. That would mark a change from North Korea's past performance on pacts with the West.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I haven't slept in 25 hours but I thought it was important to do,' he said, animated as ever in gesture and vocal cadance. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump made no promises about relaxing the economic sanctions that have strangled the hermit kingdom for years, but said he was 'actually looking forward to taking them off' if Kim follows through on his commitments. </p><img id="i-8ab88fa4226b277" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/09/4D26F5CF00000578-5833959-image-a-2_1528793144344.jpg" height="642" width="962" alt="'We're prepared to start a new history, and we're ready to write a new chapter between our two nations,' President Donald Trump said at a press conference in Singapore, announcing the terms of a landmark nuclear disarmament agreement with North Korea" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-dfcd34b243236e29" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/07/4D264CED00000578-5832911-image-a-179_1528783318139.jpg" height="642" width="962" alt="President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un concluded a day of talks in Singapore by signing what the president described as a 'very comprehensive' document" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-a0b29d2151191d66" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/09/4D26F5E400000578-5833959-image-a-3_1528793582419.jpg" height="769" width="962" alt="Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been a key component of the Singapore summit, and is pictured waiting for Trump's press conference to start after the summit with Kim Jong'un at the Capella resort on Sentosa Island" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He speculated about exchanging ambassadors with North Korea 'hopefully soon,' but cautioned that 'it's a little bit early for that.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the president said he's open to inviting Kim to the White House and visiting Pyongyang himself. 'At a certain time, I will,' he said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also projected that hostilities between the North and South 'will soon end. The past does not have to define the future.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Anyone can make war but only the most courageous can make peace. The current state of affairs cannot continue forever,' Trump proclaimed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The president said the U.S. would soon end or scale back longstanding joint military exercises with South Korea, and agreed that they were 'provocative' toward the North. He characterized them as 'very expensive,' however, and portrayed their end as an economic decision rather than a negotiated concession.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The president said he had addressed human rights issues during the summit, but downplayed Kim's brutal past.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I believe it's a rough situation over there, and we did discuss it today pretty strongly ... at pretty good length. We'll be doing something on it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think it will change.

She was left with multiple injuries including a bite to her left thigh, a stab wound to the calf and bruises to the face and arms. The weapon was found to be an 18 inch long Russell Hobbs household kitchen knife.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Goodwin who has a child aged 19 and another aged nine, who lives with his grandmother, admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and was jailed for two years.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The court heard the couple had been together for 15 months after Goodwin's previous male partner had been locked up for subjecting her to domestic abuse. The attack occurred on May 1 last year after the couple went out with friends to various pubs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nigel Booth, prosecuting said: 'The victim describes playfully smacking the bottom of someone else in the group. The defendant had seen it and Miss McQuade saw from the defendants face that she wasn't happy.</p><img id="i-a4ab4f33030b5eea" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/08/4D2656BA00000578-0-image-m-7_1528787865139.jpg" height="538" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-e27444e8db03bd0c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/08/4D2656B300000578-0-image-a-8_1528787872798.jpg" height="538" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The violence began on the doorstep of the house where Miss McQuade was challenged by the defendant and was punched in the face. The violence continued into the house where she suffered punches to the head and her hair was pulled.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'One of the defendant's friends returned to the house and managed to pull her away. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But when Miss McQuade changed into her pyjamas she was then punched again. The victim is deaf and her hearing aid had been pulled out meaning that she was unaware of the defendant approaching again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'One of their friends tried to help but the defendant bit and punched the victim who described feeling two bangs to her legs. She says it felt like a hot tap was running onto them. The defendant had stabbed the victim in the legs multiple times.</p><img id="i-2c764533a29ca86e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/08/4D2656BF00000578-0-image-a-9_1528787883227.jpg" height="408" width="306" alt="Goodwin was also ordered to abide by a restraining order preventing her from making any contact with the victim or her family" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Blood began gushing from her legs so she crawled out of the house to get away from the defendant. Aware she was losing blood she crawled onto the street shouting for help and assistance came from a neighbour who heard a woman screaming.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Communication with the victim was difficult but an ambulance was called meaning that Miss McQuade was able to get to hospital The victim suffered a number of bites, bruises and wounds. There was a human bite to the left thigh, laceration in the right thumb, a stab wound to the right calf which ruptured veins, wounds to the left thigh, bruises to the face and arms and bite marks on the arms.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The court heard the couple had not spoken since the incident.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In mitigation defence counsel Jason Macadam said his client had been taking medication due to her bipolar disorder.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He added: 'Miss Goodwin has been a victim of domestic violence herself - her previous partner having been incarcerated for violence he imposed on her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But she has no recollection of violence that occurred that night. She had been taking alcohol that day mixed with medication. The fact is she doesn't seek to blame anyone else but herself.</p><img id="i-8d099785e5ea6abc" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/08/4D26565A00000578-0-image-a-5_1528787850662.jpg" height="633" width="634" alt="In mitigation defence counsel Jason Macadam said his client, pictured,  had been taking medication due to her bipolar disorder" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This is a big wake up call for her. Clearly something went very wrong that night and she has had no contact with the complainant since the incident. I respectfully suggest bearing in mind she is 40 and has a lack of previous convictions, she can rely upon history to say she will genuinely do everything she can to make sure this will never happen again.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But sentencing Judge Maurice Greene told Goodwin: 'This was a serious case of domestic violence against your then partner. You are suffering from some kind of bipolar disorder and are on depression medication but it is quite clear on this particular night you had taken medication and alcohol and this does not mix very well at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The victim slapped someone's behind which you took offence to and when you got home later that day you attacked her in the home she shared with you. You broke one of her hearing aids and jumped on her, pulled her hair and bit her. You then came back with a knife and continued your attack She thought she was going to die because the blood wouldn't stop.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'She suffered serious injuries and she still has residual problems This was clearly a sustained attack causing serious injury She had some vulnerability because of her deafness. You also used in effect two weapons, your teeth and a knife.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Goodwin was also ordered to abide by a restraining order preventing her from making any contact with the victim or her family.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Paula Goodwin, 40, (pictured) of Middleton, Greater Manchester, knifed Clerice McQuade twice in the legs and then sank her teeth into her thigh at their home after she took exception to the incident.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Our household is gripped by the Fortnite-mare, though I can’t recall the exact moment it began. But I can tell you, as a mum to a very tech-savvy 13-year-old boy and his inquisitive 11-year-old brother, once it had my children in its glittery, cartoon-like grasp, its effect has been very hard to control.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m a very hands-on mother – running around the park, learning to ride horses with the kids and even bouncing on their trampoline on occasion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have armed myself to the teeth with Nerf guns and foam bullets, built forts out of pillows and learned to karate chop like Jackie Chan for the sake of family togetherness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But one weekend not long after <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/christmas/index.html" id="mol-6e8099e0-6dda-11e8-81f4-a1541b6a88c7">Christmas</a>, all that changed. It wasn’t the fact that my children were getting too old for fun and outdoorsy games.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No, it was the arrival on the screens of their computers and Playstation, of a game called Fortnite.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have always allowed them some screen time, though I prided myself on the fact that my oldest boy only got a phone for his 13th birthday a few months back. My husband took on the responsibility of monitoring content; they have only ever had access to age-appropriate material – no 18 certificate, sweary, gory shoot-em-up games were ever allowed in our house.</p><img id="i-ef4734f813fa6806" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/01/4D1FE9F500000578-5833013-image-a-11_1528764276232.jpg" height="359" width="634" alt="Beezy Marsh's very tech-savvy 13-year-old son and inquisitive 11 year old quickly became addicted to the violent computer game" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, when my eldest came home from school and asked if he could get a new game, called Fortnite, because the other kids in his year were playing it together, I couldn’t really see the harm in it. Once it had passed the dad-security checks, it was downloaded on to my son’s computer and also on to the Playstation. Whereas some games cost upwards of £50, the big bonus here was that Fortnite was free! Great.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of our great family traditions on Friday nights after school is to sit and have a film together after dinner but with the prospect of Fortnite-play looming, both of my boys were adamant that they should be allowed to power up the Playstation when we got in.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">If I had been a bit firmer at the start, perhaps it might have stopped what was to come but I didn’t see the harm in them having a go; they’d both worked hard that week. After an hour had elapsed, I went to have a look at what the kids were up to; normally I could get away with maybe 20 minutes without some kind of fight breaking out between them, or a Nerf bullet whizzing past my ear, or a demand to go to the park or to the shops to buy sweets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But once they were plugged into Fortnite – with their headsets allowing them to speak to each other via their microphones – there was no shifting them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They were talking to each other in a bizarre language - “On me!” , “Where are we dropping, boys?”, “I got an AR”, “He got a legendary SCAR”. The last two, it turned out, were names for weapons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Did they want any pudding? I had got chocolate ice-cream, their favourite. There was no response. “Shall we go to Risky Reels or Tilted Towers?” asked Number One son.</p><img id="i-9eaaa380ccd7bf01" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/01/4D250C2C00000578-5833013-image-a-13_1528764341050.jpg" height="736" width="634" alt="Both her children would wake up early before school to play the game and turn on their computer's as soon as they got home (pictured: Beezy and son Idris Taylor, 13)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the end I got two bowls of ice-cream and set them down in front of them. I watched them melt. My kids were stuck to that screen like glue and in the end, I had to shout at them and pull the plug out of the wall to get them off it. And that was just the start of the great Fortnite-mare. They’d get up ridiculously early on a school morning to play before I was out of bed; they’d whine and moan to be allowed on after school and would sneak on when my back was turned if I refused.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The guinea pig was forgotten, their chores were left undone and I found myself losing my temper with them because every time they were on it, they developed a total deafness to the world around them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And yet, there were positives: they could play with friends who lived miles away, there was no blood in the game, they got to be teddy bears or disco dancers (albeit gun-toting ones) and the graphics in the game were amazing to look at.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, for us, the low point came on a trip of a lifetime to Barbados at Easter when they wanted to stay in and play – you guessed it – Fortnite rather than go to the beach. We pulled the plug and started a slow process of rehabilitation; card games, swimming together, actually talking to each other again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since then, we have allowed them Fortnite at weekends only and during holidays but for a limited time. They know that we ultimately have control over it. And while they spent some Christmas pocket money buying V-bucks, the game’s currency, no amount of pester-power will persuade me to part with any more cash.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My biggest hope is that like fidget spinners and slime before them, this craze will have had its day before the summer is out. </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Beezy Marsh's sons, aged 11 and 13, quickly became addicted to the game, waking up early before school and then playing straight after getting home.

A post on the school’s website said: ‘We’ve heard some of our children, including in Year 3, are playing a game online called Fortnite ... if your child is playing this game talk to them and make sure you know what they are doing.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It comes as MPs are considering introducing laws which could see companies fined for failing to police age restrictions.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last night, Culture Secretary Matt Hancock’s Parliamentary Private Secretary Nigel Huddleston said he was ‘horrified’ to hear stories of children becoming addicted to the game. The MP for Mid Worcestershire admitted friends of his 12-year-old son spoke of ‘nothing else’, although his own child does not play. He said: ‘The Government is going to be making it increasingly difficult for children to see inappropriate content.’ Recent cases highlighted the game’s ‘addictive nature’ and ‘the extent to which it quickly impacts behaviour’, he added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During a game of Fortnite, players battle to survive on an island against strangers online – fighting and killing each other until one only person is left, hunting for weapons such as assault rifles along the way. It was given an age rating of 12 for ‘frequent scenes of mild violence’. Though the game is combat-focused, no blood is displayed on screen.</p><img id="i-9c3dec669f0497de" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D250BC000000578-0-image-a-9_1528761145971.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Parents report that Fortnite turns normally placid children into belligerent thugs obsessed with guns and killing" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">On Sunday, it emerged a girl, aged just nine, was in rehab after becoming so addicted that she would wet herself rather than leave the screen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Huddleston described the situation as ‘horrifying’ and ‘horrendous’. He warned that developers of such video games must take responsibility for the potential impact of highly addictive content.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Concerned parents have taken to forums such as Mumsnet to vent their fears. One mother wrote of her primary school age son: ‘Yesterday he saw a poster with a man and child in a swimming pool ... and commented that it would be a perfect shot to blow their heads off.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another added that her son, aged nine, had become addicted and she had imposed a ban on the game after his ‘behaviour deteriorated massively’. She wrote: ‘It was awful to see how angry he was becoming ... I seriously wish I’d never let him on it.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fortnite’s creators could not be reached for comment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Are you worried about the amount of time your children spend playing violent games like Fortnite?

But I can tell you, as a mum to a very tech-savvy 13-year-old boy and his inquisitive 11-year-old brother, once it had my children in its glittery, cartoon-like grasp, its effect has been very hard to control.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m a very hands-on mother – running around the park, learning to ride horses with the kids and even bouncing on their trampoline on occasion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have armed myself to the teeth with Nerf guns and foam bullets, built forts out of pillows and learned to karate chop like Jackie Chan for the sake of family togetherness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But one weekend not long after Christmas, all that changed. It wasn’t the fact that my children were getting too old for fun and outdoorsy games.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No, it was the arrival on the screens of their computers and Playstation, of a game called Fortnite.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have always allowed them some screen time, though I prided myself on the fact that my oldest boy only got a phone for his 13th birthday a few months back. My husband took on the responsibility of monitoring content; they have only ever had access to age-appropriate material – no 18 certificate, sweary, gory shoot-em-up games were ever allowed in our house.</p><img id="i-884423b091ac93d7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D250C2C00000578-0-Our_household_is_gripped_by_the_Fortnite_mare_though_I_can_t_rec-m-11_1528761264423.jpg" height="711" width="634" alt="Our household is gripped by the Fortnite-mare, though I can’t recall the exact moment it began says Beezy Marsh, pictured here with her 13-year-old son Idris Taylor" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, when my eldest came home from school and asked if he could get a new game, called Fortnite, because the other kids in his year were playing it together, I couldn’t really see the harm in it. Once it had passed the dad-security checks, it was downloaded on to my son’s computer and also on to the Playstation. Whereas some games cost upwards of £50, the big bonus here was that Fortnite was free! Great.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of our great family traditions on Friday nights after school is to sit and have a film together after dinner but with the prospect of Fortnite-play looming, both of my boys were adamant that they should be allowed to power up the Playstation when we got in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If I had been a bit firmer at the start, perhaps it might have stopped what was to come but I didn’t see the harm in them having a go; they’d both worked hard that week. After an hour had elapsed, I went to have a look at what the kids were up to; normally I could get away with maybe 20 minutes without some kind of fight breaking out between them, or a Nerf bullet whizzing past my ear, or a demand to go to the park or to the shops to buy sweets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But once they were plugged into Fortnite – with their headsets allowing them to speak to each other via their microphones – there was no shifting them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They were talking to each other in a bizarre language - “On me!” , “Where are we dropping, boys?”, “I got an AR”, “He got a legendary SCAR”. The last two, it turned out, were names for weapons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Did they want any pudding? I had got chocolate ice-cream, their favourite. There was no response. “Shall we go to Risky Reels or Tilted Towers?” asked Number One son.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the end I got two bowls of ice-cream and set them down in front of them. I watched them melt. My kids were stuck to that screen like glue and in the end, I had to shout at them and pull the plug out of the wall to get them off it. And that was just the start of the great Fortnite-mare. They’d get up ridiculously early on a school morning to play before I was out of bed; they’d whine and moan to be allowed on after school and would sneak on when my back was turned if I refused.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The guinea pig was forgotten, their chores were left undone and I found myself losing my temper with them because every time they were on it, they developed a total deafness to the world around them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And yet, there were positives: they could play with friends who lived miles away, there was no blood in the game, they got to be teddy bears or disco dancers (albeit gun-toting ones) and the graphics in the game were amazing to look at.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, for us, the low point came on a trip of a lifetime to Barbados at Easter when they wanted to stay in and play – you guessed it – Fortnite rather than go to the beach. We pulled the plug and started a slow process of rehabilitation; card games, swimming together, actually talking to each other again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since then, we have allowed them Fortnite at weekends only and during holidays but for a limited time. They know that we ultimately have control over it. And while they spent some Christmas pocket money buying V-bucks, the game’s currency, no amount of pester-power will persuade me to part with any more cash.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My biggest hope is that like fidget spinners and slime before them, this craze will have had its day before the summer is out. </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Jemma Garside, who runs a primary school in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said the games are distracting children from their learning.

Sentosa was subsequently developed as a resort and expanded on reclaimed land.</p><img id="i-b657edb5c9a1b453" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/03/4D13F2E000000578-5832911-Technicians_install_a_surveillance_camera_at_the_entrance_of_the-a-16_1528770750163.jpg" height="608" width="914" alt="Technicians install a surveillance camera at the entrance of the five-star Capella Hotel on Sentosa island on Saturday" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nevertheless, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's prime minister from 1959 to 1990, used the island to hold long-term political prisoners who were often detained without trial. Chia Thye Poh, a former member of parliament, spent 23 years in jail and under loose house arrest there.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He worked as a freelance translator for the island's management, before he was allowed to visit the mainland for a short time every day and set free.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But these days, Sentosa is a popular resort island, with numerous beaches, hotels and restaurants, and attracts around 19 million visitors every year. </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump said Thursday when it's all said and done he expects the normalization of relations between the U.S. and North Korea. He floated a peace agreement as a potential show of good faith.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We're looking at it. We're talking about it with them. We're talking about it with a lot of other people. But that could happen,' he said at his news conference on Thursday. 'Sounds a little bit strange, but that's probably the easy part; the hard part remains after that.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Klingner, an ex-CIA operative who is now a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, cautioned Trump against being too ready to sign an agreement, even one as benign on the surface as declaring peace, however.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Even if just a political declaration is made, that could have an impact on alliance deterrence capabilities, which would be dangerous if we don't first address the North Koran threat,' he told DailyMail.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said any deal that Trump signs must include 'a clear commitment to denculearization' based on the United Nations' standards, not North Korea's, and it must include 'sufficient verification' that Kim has given up all of his nuclear weapons and production facilities.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Beatrice Finh, the executive director of The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), similarly said that a deal must include a timeline for disarmament and a requirement that competent international authorities carry out routine compliance checks. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finh said mandatory adoption of the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty by both North Korea and the United States, which is a signatory to the UN-treaty but hasn't ratified it, should also be part of any accord that comes about.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We need to see the international legal framework involved in this deal, not just whatever these two men like that come up with,' she stressed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2017, Finh accepted a Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of ICAN for the organization's work to implement the test ban treaty. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She assessed ahead of Trump's meeting with Kim, 'There are no quick fixes to this. This is going to be a long process.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Going to war is not an option, so we need to work together,' she said, ' and that's also why it important to bring in the international community and the legal framework that exists to build a kind of consistent stable ground for disarming nuclear weapons.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The potential for a 'bad deal' that leaves America's allies in the region at risk was an issue uniting the left and the right heading into the summit. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Schumer led a group of seven Senate Democrats in sending a letter to Trump last week stipulating what it would take for him to receive support for a deal in the split party Senate. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They want a permanent ban on nuclear weapons, as well as language barring North Korean from further developing ballistic missiles.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If President Trump meets with Kim Jong-un and receives a deal that truly lives up to these principles, he will have made the world a much safer place,' Schumer said during a call with reporters. 'But if he tries to reach a deal with Kim Jong-un, just for the sake of reaching a deal, and the agreement fails to live up to the principles we've laid out, then he'll have been bested at the negotiating table yet again.'</p><mol-permabox id="mol-1d3bb330-6dda-11e8-b30e-4ddf835fc2b7"></mol-permabox><p class="mol-para-with-font">While Trump has not explicitly said that a deal with North Korea would have to include the demands made by Senate Democrats, he lodged a nearly identical list of complaints against the Iran nuclear deal that was brokered by the previous administration. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump has since ended U.S. involvement in the nuclear accord on the grounds that it had a 10-year sunset clause for some operations and did not punish Tehran for the development of ballistic missiles.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He did not comment on the issue of ballistic missiles on Thursday in the Rose Garden as a dispute over short- and long-range missiles came up several times during a joint news conference with Japan's Abe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, it was the Japanese prime minister who said, 'On this point, between Japan and U.S. and international community share the same view. I am convinced about it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a neighbor to North Korea, Japan is asserting that a deal must ban all ranges of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction and not just the ones with the ability to cross the Pacific to hit targets in the continental U.S.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump said Thursday that he was taking into consideration the concerns of all the major players in the region as he sits down with Kim to make a deal – such as South Korea's Moon Jae-in and China's Xi Jingping.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'President Xi of China has been terrific. The border has been certainly more closed than ever before. I'd like them to close it a little bit more, but it's been more closed than ever before,' Trump said of the leader who has become an unlikely friend of his. 'I give President Xi tremendous credit, and I give President Moon tremendous credit. He really would like to see something happen.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He added, 'They've been living with the threat of war from their beginning, and it doesn't make sense. And I really believe that Kim Jong-un wants to do something. I think he wants to see something incredible happen for the people of North Korea.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pressure is on for Trump to come out of the summit with something tangible, even if his administration says that's not the point of the two-party talks - especially in the context of Trump's recent decision to withdraw the U.S. from the nuclear accord it entered into in 2015 with Iran, says Joel Rubin, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs who is an adjunct faculty member at Carnegie Mellon.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He can't come back from [talks with] North Korea with an agreement that's three pages after having just ripped up a several hundred page detailed document with Iran and have it pass the laugh test,' Rubin told DailyMail.com.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Iran deal, he noted, was the product of years of negotiations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So for the president to go to a summit first, is not how it's typically done. It's usually done after most of these issues have been hammered out and there's clarity on the objectives,' he said. 'They want to do it differently, so, OK, good, let them him do it differently, and I think there's value in having him engage. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But he needs to stay engaged and he needs to find what they want in order for it to really be an effective negotiation,' Rubin said.</p><video preload="none" id="4361706908720974679" title="Trump calls expected meeting with Kim Jong-Un 'mission of peace'" poster="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/16/4D151B6400000578-0-image-a-2_1528558225710.jpg">

The Institute for Strategic Studies claims Kim’s troops are ‘reliant on a predominantly obsolescent equipment inventory’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The US military boasts 1.3million members and an annual budget of $597 billion (£446billion) – almost 15 times North Korea’s annual GDP.

His standard dinner order is two Big Macs, two Filet-O-Fish burgers and a chocolate milkshake – adding up to an epic 2,430 calories and enough salt to give a bull elephant heart palpitations.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kim’s culinary passions were by contrast forged at school in Switzerland. He likes rosti, the fat-laden national potato dish, and has a serious weakness for imported European cheese which (much like Trump’s passion for hamburgers) is writ large in his ever-expanding waistline.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Coke or champagne?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump is largely teetotal, a lifestyle choice he ascribes to the loss of elder brother Fred Jr, who died as a result of alcoholism in his early 40s. Instead he gulps down vast quantities of Diet Coke – 12 cans a day according to the New York Times last year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kim is less abstemious. He is a big fan of fine wine, quaffing so much champagne at the recent state dinner with South Korea that he became ‘bleary eyed’, witnesses said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Tale of the scales</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Both roly-poly world leaders look dangerously overweight, but is either officially obese? As so often, when it comes to this delicate subject, it depends who you talk to. In January, White House doctor Ronny Jackson claimed Trump was in ‘excellent shape’, saying he was 6ft 3in and weighed 239lb (just over 17st).</p><img id="i-21e4555acd87bb6a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D25357E00000578-0-image-a-3_1528760212359.jpg" height="459" width="306" alt="Kim, who is often photographed in high heels, is around 5ft 9in" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Incredibly, this made the President 1lb under the clinical obesity threshold, leading many to speculate that figures were fiddled.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kim, who is often photographed in high heels, is around 5ft 9in. But his weight has ballooned to around 15st, exacerbating soreness in his knees (which he has suffered since purportedly crashing a racing car in 2007).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Life and loves</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like many a billionaire, Trump is curiously attractive to a certain sort of upwardly-mobile young woman, and has over the years ploughed through three wives, producing five children in the process.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kim has managed just the one spouse: a former cheerleader and cabaret singer called Ri Sol-ju. They are thought to have married in 2009 and have three children, the oldest born in 2010. He has been more ruthless with his exes than Donald ever would. Former girlfriend Hyon Song-wol, a singer, was arrested in 2013 and executed by firing squad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The little princes</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Both were raised into a form of royalty. Trump spent his early years in the New York suburb of Queens, in a mock-Tudor house that can now be rented for $800 a night on Airbnb, and grew up secure in the knowledge he would inherit around $40million in his late 20s.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kim grew up at the presidential palace in Pyongyang, second child of ruler Kim Jong-il and his wife Kim Yong-hui. Most intelligence about his childhood comes from Fujimoto, the family sushi chef who defected. He portrayed the future despot as a spoiled child who learned to drive at seven (‘they put a little box beneath his seat to help him reach the pedals’) and who would fight viciously with any friends or relatives silly enough to beat him at a board games.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Rest and relaxation</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump is all about golf, playing some 110 rounds in the 18 or so months since he took office, at a cost to US taxpayers of $67million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kim’s sport is basketball. Though now too overweight to play, he became a huge fan during the late 90s. During his time in Switzerland, Kim also spent plenty of time on the ski slopes. Perhaps that explains not only why he recently ordered the construction of Masik Pass – a multi-million-pound ski resort – but was also anxious to send a large delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, a gesture which brought the thaw in relations that led to this week’s summit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>(In)famous pals</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kim’s basketball obsession underpins a curious friendship with Dennis Rodman, a former NBA star who since retirement has become a tattooed reality TV personality.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rodman has made several (apparently paid) trips to Pyongyang, leading to speculation that he helped maintain a back-channel line of communication between Washington and North Korea.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump’s status as a bete noire of Hollywood liberals makes his roster of celebrity chums even more eclectic. It includes Right-wing rock stars Ted Nugent and Kid Rock, plus Roseanne Barr – the TV comedian pulled from the airwaves last week for putting racist content on social media.</p><img id="i-d58dd781e8032f1d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D25358A00000578-0-image-m-5_1528760321060.jpg" height="620" width="634" alt="Trump’s favourite restaurant is McDonald’s, due to an obsession with personal hygiene that limits him to food chargrilled to within an inch of its life" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The pesky press</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If there’s one thing both leaders can agree on, it’s their shared loathing of the impertinent Fourth Estate. Trump rails endlessly against the alleged ‘fake news’ propagated by the world’s ‘lame-stream’ media, publicly attacking reporters and news organisations who seek to hold him to account.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kim has a more effective media management policy: like all Left-wing dictators, he bans independent news, forcing North Koreans to get information via state TV and radio or two government newspapers – the Pyongyang Times and Rodong Sinmun – which sprinkle everything from sports reports to weather forecasts with tributes to the ‘dear, respected Kim Jong-un’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Life is tweet</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump spends the wee hours using Twitter to share often somewhat incoherent observations about world affairs. But Kim doesn’t ‘do’ Twitter – or indeed any other form of social media, having outlawed the ‘imperialist’ internet. The country’s version, the kwangmyong, is largely used by academics and civil servants, and reportedly permits access to a mere 28 websites.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Deadly serious</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump recently called for drug dealers to get the death penalty, outraging the liberal media. But that’s playground stuff compared with Kim, who once bumped off a disloyal general, Hyon Yong-choi, by having him shot by a rocket launcher on a military firing range.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>They’re so popular!</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was a landslide for Kim the last time his people went to the ballot box, in 2014, with 100 per cent of voters supporting his election to the country’s highest legislative body, on a turnout of 99.7 percent.</p><img id="i-3907dfecdad36929" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D25358600000578-0-image-m-8_1528760370563.jpg" height="430" width="306" alt="Kim's former girlfriend Hyon Song-wol, a singer, was arrested in 2013 and executed by firing squad" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump can only dream of such popular support. The 62.9million votes he secured in 2016, on a 55.7 per cent turnout, was almost three million fewer than Hillary Clinton managed and he only gained the White House by winning narrow races in key marginal states.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Screen idols</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump has over the years enjoyed cameo roles in countless Hollywood staples, including Home Alone, Zoolander, and various episodes of Wrestlemania, along with Sex And The City and his country’s version of The Apprentice, which he hosts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The absence of a TV industry in North Korea has meant slimmer pickings for Kim.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However his father was pilloried in Team America, a 2004 satirical puppet movie by the makers of South Park, and he was impersonated in the 2014 comedy The Interview. Trump also did Pizza Hut advertisements. Kim presumably would prefer to eat the stuff.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Trading insults</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When North Korea conducted a provocative missile test last year, Trump used Twitter to threaten ‘fire and fury’ towards the ‘little rocket man’. He’s also called Kim a ‘maniac’, said Pyongyang was the ‘last place on earth I’d want to go’ and asked: ‘Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kim responded in kind, instructing state TV to broadcast footage of military bands playing a popular marching song called ‘Death to the US Imperialist Aggressors!’ In official statements, his spokesmen have called Trump a ‘madman’ and a ‘mentally deranged US dotard’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Fit for the job?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kim was spotted walking with a limp in 2014, sparking reports that his Emmental, rosti and red wine consumption was causing gout. Trump’s health has also been a source of endless impertinent speculation, with it suggested during the 2016 election that his age – he is now 71 – and lack of fitness meant he was not up to the rigours of office.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He attempted to silence the doubters by publishing a doctor’s note describing his health as ‘astonishingly excellent’. However the physician who signed it, Dr Harold Bornstein, later revealed that the entire document had been dictated to him... by Trump.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Trump is largely teetotal, a lifestyle choice he ascribes to the loss of elder brother Fred Jr, who died as a result of alcoholism in his early 40s. Instead he gulps down vast quantities of Diet Coke – 12 cans a day according to the New York Times last year. Kim is less abstemious. He is a big fan of fine wine, quaffing so much champagne at the recent state dinner with South Korea that he became ‘bleary eyed’, witnesses said.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Jessica Green</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-12T01:03:34.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Eyeball to eyeball: Trump’s teetotal.

I can’t even spell the word “hobby”.’ The son of an electronics retailer, he studied at Cambridge and Harvard before going to work for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in the 1970s.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 1985, aged 40, he took control of Wire &amp; Plastic Products, which made wire shopping baskets, and turned it into a marketing company. As chief executive he created an advertising empire with 200,000 employees in 112 countries and a turnover of £15.3billion. Its success was reflected in his pay and bonuses, which totalled £70.4million in 2015 – then believed to be the highest pay package in British corporate history.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since 2010, he has pocketed more than £230million in pay and bonuses, and a long-term incentive scheme means he will receive another £20million from WPP over the next five years – despite his resignation and the misconduct inquiry.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The two colleagues were sitting outside a bar when they allegedly witnessed their boss going into Flat 50a. Afterwards, one of them took a photograph of the location, the FT reported.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is unclear whether the two WPP employees mentioned anything about their alleged sighting to the company at the time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But later it became central to the firm’s investigation into its chief executive’s alleged misconduct. In the early months of 2018, one of the employees broke their silence and confided to a senior colleague about what they had allegedly seen that evening in June 2017, said the FT.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Exhausted chauffeur fired for wanting to rest</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One catalyst for the investigation was apparently the firing of Sir Martin’s long-serving chauffeur. The popular driver had worked for the millionaire chief executive for some 15 years until he was abruptly sacked last October.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The unnamed chauffeur used to ferry Sir Martin around London in a Range Rover and was also often on call for his wife Cristiana too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One night last October, he had allegedly been working for 12 hours without a break when he was asked to pick up Lady Sorrell from the exclusive restaurant Mayfair Isabel and run her back to the couple’s £5million Belgravia home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to sources who spoke to the FT, it was already 2am and the driver was told he would have to be back in place for another job at 7am.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was said that he refused to pick up Lady Sorrell, saying he would be too tired and unsafe on the road if he only got two or three hours’ sleep.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Sorrells fired him the next day, the FT claimed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The driver was a popular figure at WPP’s Farm Street offices, said to be well liked by the personal assistants who helped Sir Martin maintain his exhausting round-the-clock schedule.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His dismissal was ‘met with shock and sadness across the executive suite’, the newspaper said – as well as a resolve to act. The alleged shabby treatment of the chauffeur was apparently a key factor motivating a future whistleblower.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>A fiery temper and four-letter outbursts</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another factor was said to be Sir Martin’s alleged fiery temper. The ad boss built his multi-billion-pound empire virtually from scratch and is said to work day and night, quick-firing off emails and micro-managing his sprawling business, which has 200,000 employees across the globe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But he is known to expect his employees to match his pace and the role of Sir Martin’s executive assistants (EAs) has allegedly proved particularly ‘punishing’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The chief executive’s six EAs earn around £80,000 apiece but one described her salary as ‘battle pay’, in light of the verbal abuse she has to put up with.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He was brutal and inhuman in how he dealt with his assistants,’ one former executive told the FT. ‘He would say “you’re f***ing idiots, what’s f***ing wrong with you”… He had a real dark side.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A former WPP board member said being an executive assistant was ‘a pretty thankless task’, a role that another employee likened to ‘being in an abusive relationship’, with Sir Martin presenting a charming image to the outside world that was at odds with the one that was witnessed by staff. The chief executive apparently called one elderly colleague a ‘pudding’ and described others as ‘bozos’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Executive assistants working closely with Sir Martin did not typically last longer than 18 months because the job was too tough, according to the newspaper. One ex-employee told the FT: ‘After a year, my doctor told me that if I continued I would be dead.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sir Martin is said to accept that he can be difficult at times but strongly denies mistreating, abusing or bullying staff and his supporters said many people have worked for years at WPP, and that Sir Martin has received dozens of messages of support.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Bewildering expenses claims </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another factor explaining the unease in the WPP boardroom was the alleged ‘blending’ of Sir Martin’s expenditure on his corporate and private life – not to mention that of his wife.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The City veteran is described as a perpetual motion machine, working all hours – including during holiday – and constantly responding to emails.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His business took him all over the world as he mixed with the global elite. He was among the guests at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding in Windsor last month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lady Sorrell was often expected to be at Sir Martin’s side at events with clients and their spouses, but some claimed it was occasionally difficult to discern when he and his wife were travelling for business or pleasure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The blurred lines between the spending for corporate and personal purposes was said to have led to ‘fierce arguments’ at head office about which items required personal reimbursement by Sir Martin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2015, Sir Martin drew attention for chalking up £274,000 in travel expenses for his wife, who is a senior City executive in her own right, with high-flying roles at the World Economic Forum, telecoms giant Viacom and the cosmetics firm Revlon.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After 2015, WPP stopped providing travel expenses for Lady Sorrell, 43 – Sir Martin’s second wife – who gave birth to the couple’s daughter in November 2016.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite a generous benefits and pay package that made him the country’s best-paid chief executive in 2015 – earning £70million that year – the FT said it had been ‘common for Sir Martin to request cash for day-to-day expenses’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The newspaper claimed this had ‘long puzzled head office staff’, who were aware his restaurant, drinks, transport, laundry and gifts expenses were typically put on the company account or credit card.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was ‘all the more puzzling’, said the FT, because Sir Martin was not always required to provide receipts for the cash he received. In covering the globe for his company, Sir Martin was bound to rack up significant expenses as part of his duties. Auditors always signed off WPP’s accounts and insiders insisted that ‘great care and attention’ was always taken by the company and the chief executive over his expenses and that he ‘denies there was any misuse of funds’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How whistleblower sparked investigation  </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All of the above served as the backdrop to the investigation by WPP into its own chief executive’s alleged use of a prostitute.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sir Martin had long dominated the company he founded, but 2017 witnessed the downfall of a succession of powerful men in the media and Hollywood.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In January this year, it was revealed that WPP had sponsored the Presidents Club charity dinner at which high-powered businessmen were accused of sexually harassing ‘hostesses’ hired to be groped at the event.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Amid widespread criticism of men’s behaviour at this event, one WPP employee decided to turn whistleblower to reveal what they had witnessed last June in Shepherd Market – their boss allegedly visiting a brothel. The allegation was passed up the chain to WPP’s chairman Roberto Quarta, who set up a subcommittee that eventually called in a Washington law firm, WilmerHale, to investigate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The whistleblower provided the photo of 50a Shepherd Market. Sir Martin was interviewed for two hours by WilmerHale partners on March 29. Believing it was a routine matter, he did not have a lawyer present, according to the FT.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On April 13, WilmerHale’s findings – considered so sensitive that a written report was not provided – were revealed verbally to the board.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Friends of Sir Martin said he was not given the full picture. The investigation concluded that there was no proof of misuse of company funds, that the amounts of money in question were ‘wholly immaterial’ and that no other WPP employee was affected.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The board apparently concluded the matter was largely a personal issue for Sir Martin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet the fact that the investigation had been carried out was leaked to The Wall Street Journal and Sir Martin is said to have concluded that his position as CEO was untenable, resigning the following day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">WPP has said it would be breaching the Data Protection Act to reveal the details of Sir Martin’s departure, and his spokesman has said he signed a non-disclosure agreement ‘which he has adhered to and will continue to adhere to’. The spokesman added that Sir Martin ‘strenuously denies’ the allegations.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>It was a chance sighting a year ago by two off-duty employees of Sir Martin Sorrell’s multi-billion-pound advertising empire WPP that was to culminate in his explosive exit from the company he founded 33 years ago.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gill Walton of the RCM said the new guidelines would help ensure such mothers did not feel guilty. ‘We want to respect women’s choices and make sure they have the right information and support to either mixed-feed their babies or formula feed their babies,’ she added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We would focus on the risks and benefits of both breastfeeding and formula feeding – and help them do that – rather than say “Oh, this mother’s decided to formula feed, we’re not going to help her”.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘That’s not right.

The current consensus among health experts is the longer the babies are given breast milk the better.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It contains antibodies from the mother that help fight off infections, allergies and asthma. Breastfed babies are also less likely to become obese as the milk has a lower fat content than formula. The act of breastfeeding burns between 300 and 500 calories a day for the mother.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">WHO experts suggest women should continue to breastfeed toddlers while giving them solid food until they are two or beyond.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its website states ‘virtually all mothers can breastfeed’ provided they have ‘accurate information’ and support.</p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Britain only 34 per cent are still giving their babies any breastmilk at six months, including just 1 per cent who exclusively breastfeed.

It will hopefully give new mothers the permission to create a Plan A and Plan B if they wish to try breastfeeding, but then need or want to revert to combination feeding or solely formula feeding.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The RCM, which represents 47,000 midwives, said the guidelines would be circulated among midwives in hospitals and followed feedback from women who felt they lacked the right information.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some hospitals do not allow women home after giving birth until they have shown they can breastfeed.

WPP called in investigators following the whistleblower’s claims.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A report subsequently concluded the money was ‘immaterial’ and it was a personal matter for Sir Martin, it was said. He apparently decided to quit WPP, despite denying the accusation against him, because of a breakdown in relations with the board.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He is now setting up a rival company. For two months, WPP has steadfastly refused to explain why Sir Martin stepped down, to the frustration of some large investors who have called for greater transparency.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yesterday friends of the mogul were blaming the astonishing situation on an ex-employee ‘with a grudge slinging mud at him’ and said he was ‘pretty cheesed off about it’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One said: ‘It has turned out to be a very murky, unpleasant business. He has no complaint about there being an investigation if there needed to be one, but he felt it was badly conducted. He doesn’t want to sit down at the same table with those people on the board again.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another friend told The Times: ‘He denies the allegation that he saw a prostitute. He understands that the allegation was made by a disgruntled employee. If you run a business with 200,000 employees for 30 years, some will fall out with you.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The mogul’s spokesman said last night there was nothing to add to a previous statement which said: ‘Sir Martin signed a non-disclosure agreement when he stepped down which precludes him from discussing any of the circumstances surrounding his departure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He has rigidly adhered to this obligation and will continue to do so.

I can’t even spell the word “hobby”.’ The son of an electronics retailer, he studied at Cambridge and Harvard before going to work for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in the 1970s.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 1985, aged 40, he took control of Wire &amp; Plastic Products, which made wire shopping baskets, and turned it into a marketing company. As chief executive he created an advertising empire with 200,000 employees in 112 countries and a turnover of £15.3billion. Its success was reflected in his pay and bonuses, which totalled £70.4million in 2015 – then believed to be the highest pay package in British corporate history.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since 2010, he has pocketed more than £230million in pay and bonuses, and a long-term incentive scheme means he will receive another £20million from WPP over the next five years – despite his resignation and the misconduct inquiry.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The two colleagues were sitting outside a bar when they allegedly witnessed their boss going into Flat 50a. Afterwards, one of them took a photograph of the location, the FT reported.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is unclear whether the two WPP employees mentioned anything about their alleged sighting to the company at the time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But later it became central to the firm’s investigation into its chief executive’s alleged misconduct. In the early months of 2018, one of the employees broke their silence and confided to a senior colleague about what they had allegedly seen that evening in June 2017, said the FT.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Exhausted chauffeur fired for wanting to rest</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One catalyst for the investigation was apparently the firing of Sir Martin’s long-serving chauffeur. The popular driver had worked for the millionaire chief executive for some 15 years until he was abruptly sacked last October.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The unnamed chauffeur used to ferry Sir Martin around London in a Range Rover and was also often on call for his wife Cristiana too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One night last October, he had allegedly been working for 12 hours without a break when he was asked to pick up Lady Sorrell from the exclusive restaurant Mayfair Isabel and run her back to the couple’s £5million Belgravia home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to sources who spoke to the FT, it was already 2am and the driver was told he would have to be back in place for another job at 7am.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was said that he refused to pick up Lady Sorrell, saying he would be too tired and unsafe on the road if he only got two or three hours’ sleep.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Sorrells fired him the next day, the FT claimed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The driver was a popular figure at WPP’s Farm Street offices, said to be well liked by the personal assistants who helped Sir Martin maintain his exhausting round-the-clock schedule.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His dismissal was ‘met with shock and sadness across the executive suite’, the newspaper said – as well as a resolve to act. The alleged shabby treatment of the chauffeur was apparently a key factor motivating a future whistleblower.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>A fiery temper and four-letter outbursts</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another factor was said to be Sir Martin’s alleged fiery temper. The ad boss built his multi-billion-pound empire virtually from scratch and is said to work day and night, quick-firing off emails and micro-managing his sprawling business, which has 200,000 employees across the globe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But he is known to expect his employees to match his pace and the role of Sir Martin’s executive assistants (EAs) has allegedly proved particularly ‘punishing’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The chief executive’s six EAs earn around £80,000 apiece but one described her salary as ‘battle pay’, in light of the verbal abuse she has to put up with.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He was brutal and inhuman in how he dealt with his assistants,’ one former executive told the FT. ‘He would say “you’re f***ing idiots, what’s f***ing wrong with you”… He had a real dark side.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A former WPP board member said being an executive assistant was ‘a pretty thankless task’, a role that another employee likened to ‘being in an abusive relationship’, with Sir Martin presenting a charming image to the outside world that was at odds with the one that was witnessed by staff. The chief executive apparently called one elderly colleague a ‘pudding’ and described others as ‘bozos’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Executive assistants working closely with Sir Martin did not typically last longer than 18 months because the job was too tough, according to the newspaper. One ex-employee told the FT: ‘After a year, my doctor told me that if I continued I would be dead.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sir Martin is said to accept that he can be difficult at times but strongly denies mistreating, abusing or bullying staff and his supporters said many people have worked for years at WPP, and that Sir Martin has received dozens of messages of support.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Bewildering expenses claims </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another factor explaining the unease in the WPP boardroom was the alleged ‘blending’ of Sir Martin’s expenditure on his corporate and private life – not to mention that of his wife.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The City veteran is described as a perpetual motion machine, working all hours – including during holiday – and constantly responding to emails.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His business took him all over the world as he mixed with the global elite. He was among the guests at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding in Windsor last month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lady Sorrell was often expected to be at Sir Martin’s side at events with clients and their spouses, but some claimed it was occasionally difficult to discern when he and his wife were travelling for business or pleasure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The blurred lines between the spending for corporate and personal purposes was said to have led to ‘fierce arguments’ at head office about which items required personal reimbursement by Sir Martin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2015, Sir Martin drew attention for chalking up £274,000 in travel expenses for his wife, who is a senior City executive in her own right, with high-flying roles at the World Economic Forum, telecoms giant Viacom and the cosmetics firm Revlon.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After 2015, WPP stopped providing travel expenses for Lady Sorrell, 43 – Sir Martin’s second wife – who gave birth to the couple’s daughter in November 2016.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite a generous benefits and pay package that made him the country’s best-paid chief executive in 2015 – earning £70million that year – the FT said it had been ‘common for Sir Martin to request cash for day-to-day expenses’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The newspaper claimed this had ‘long puzzled head office staff’, who were aware his restaurant, drinks, transport, laundry and gifts expenses were typically put on the company account or credit card.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was ‘all the more puzzling’, said the FT, because Sir Martin was not always required to provide receipts for the cash he received. In covering the globe for his company, Sir Martin was bound to rack up significant expenses as part of his duties. Auditors always signed off WPP’s accounts and insiders insisted that ‘great care and attention’ was always taken by the company and the chief executive over his expenses and that he ‘denies there was any misuse of funds’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How whistleblower sparked investigation  </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All of the above served as the backdrop to the investigation by WPP into its own chief executive’s alleged use of a prostitute.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sir Martin had long dominated the company he founded, but 2017 witnessed the downfall of a succession of powerful men in the media and Hollywood.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In January this year, it was revealed that WPP had sponsored the Presidents Club charity dinner at which high-powered businessmen were accused of sexually harassing ‘hostesses’ hired to be groped at the event.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Amid widespread criticism of men’s behaviour at this event, one WPP employee decided to turn whistleblower to reveal what they had witnessed last June in Shepherd Market – their boss allegedly visiting a brothel. The allegation was passed up the chain to WPP’s chairman Roberto Quarta, who set up a subcommittee that eventually called in a Washington law firm, WilmerHale, to investigate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The whistleblower provided the photo of 50a Shepherd Market. Sir Martin was interviewed for two hours by WilmerHale partners on March 29. Believing it was a routine matter, he did not have a lawyer present, according to the FT.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On April 13, WilmerHale’s findings – considered so sensitive that a written report was not provided – were revealed verbally to the board.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Friends of Sir Martin said he was not given the full picture. The investigation concluded that there was no proof of misuse of company funds, that the amounts of money in question were ‘wholly immaterial’ and that no other WPP employee was affected.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The board apparently concluded the matter was largely a personal issue for Sir Martin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet the fact that the investigation had been carried out was leaked to The Wall Street Journal and Sir Martin is said to have concluded that his position as CEO was untenable, resigning the following day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">WPP has said it would be breaching the Data Protection Act to reveal the details of Sir Martin’s departure, and his spokesman has said he signed a non-disclosure agreement ‘which he has adhered to and will continue to adhere to’. The spokesman added that Sir Martin ‘strenuously denies’ the allegations.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Inside the £160 an hour brothel above a bookies at centre of Martin Sorrell scandal</h2><img id="i-65e85b7dcd29c1a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/07/4D2328C500000578-5832679-image-a-2_1528786695776.jpg" height="408" width="306" alt="This is the doorway of the seedy brothel at the centre of the BPP scandal" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Behind the plain white front door is a lurid pink sign announcing ‘beautiful model’ and wooden stairs leading up to a one-bedroom flat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Visitors are ushered into a generous room with a king-size bed adorned with neon red fairy lights.

But being in the heart of Mayfair, this flat, which once belonged to a peer, is worth £1.3million.

Seconds later, the young lady, clad in black lingerie and wearing black high heels, could be seen sitting cross-legged in a tiny waiting area.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She looked in her mid 20s, was about 5ft 5in tall and of slim build. She had straight black hair, longer than shoulder length, and wore dark mascara. She spoke with an eastern European accent. Seemingly shy but cautiously friendly, she did not wish to give her name and said she operated on a ‘no questions asked’ basis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Inside the bedroom there is cream acrylic carpet, burgundy wallpaper and dimmed lighting. Thick dark curtains are pulled tight across windows that look out on Shepherd Market, a favourite playground of expensive bars and restaurants for the capital’s wealthier residents.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Speaking softly, the woman nervously ran through the price list. For £60, clients get a 20-minute session. It costs £160 for an hour of ‘whatever you want’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The flat, above a ground-floor branch of bookmakers William Hill, has an en-suite bathroom and a rudimentary kitchen. The walls are bare, apart from an A4-size silhouette image of a woman.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I rent this apartment for my business for one day a week, every Monday,’ she said. ‘We don’t really know the other girls who work here. I don’t see anybody else. We just leave some money in the microwave to pay the rent. Some people come back lots of times, some people only visit once. We don’t ask them personal questions because they don’t want to answer them.

He died in 1984 aged 75, and the flat was left in his will. It is unclear who now rents it out but the will’s executor, Michael Williamson, is named as the proprietor in the Land Registry records. He was unavailable for comment yesterday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shepherd Market’s seedy reputation dates back to the 1980s when former Tory Party deputy chairman Jeffrey – now Lord – Archer, paid a prostitute for sex, the late Monica Coghlan, after meeting her in Mayfair.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>One of Britain’s most powerful men faced a barrage of humiliating allegations yesterday. Multi-millionaire Sir Martin Sorrell, pictured left with his wife Cristiana Falcone Sorrell, is said to have put a £300 visit to a Mayfair brothel, pictured right, on expenses. He was also accused of bullying staff and ‘blurring’ the line between corporate and personal expenditure for himself and his wife.

Trump advisers also ripped Trudeau, branding him a back-stabber.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>AP</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Wires</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T22:22:06.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Robert De Niro apologizes to Canada for 'idiotic behavior' of Trump</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T22:22:06.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Canada,Donald Trump</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5829925/PIERS-MORGAN-Trump-bashing-stars-America-sucked-war-succeed.html" title="PIERS MORGAN: Trump-bashing stars like De Niro and Maher now hate him so much they¿d rather see America sucked into war and recession than for him to succeed ¿ we used to call that treason"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5828513/Robert-DeNiro-yells-F-Trump-stage-Tonys-TWICE-gets-standing-ovation.html" title="How to succeed on Broadway: Robert DeNiro yells 'f*** Trump' TWICE during a foul-mouthed tirade on stage at the Tony Awards - and gets a standing ovation"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5831117/Michael-Cohen-wife-lunch-pricey-Tribeca-steakhouse-owned-Robert-Niro.html" title="Michael Cohen and his wife have lunch at pricey Tribeca steakhouse co-owned by Robert De Niro and once favored by Harvey Weinstein"></link></item><item><title>Robert De Niro and Donald Trump: Twitter reacts to actor’s F-bomb Tony Awards speech</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5831543/Robert-Niro-Donald-Trump-Twitter-reacts-actors-F-bomb-Tony-Awards-speech.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2018 17:10:38 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5831543</guid><description><![CDATA[Robert De Niro had a lot to say about Donald Trump at the Tony Awards 2018.

The sport, played out annually in the Italian city's Santa Croce square, takes the 'beautiful' out of the game and smashes just about everything in between the popular phrase. While it is too brutal for some, it is not so much for Apple CEO Tim Cook who was watching this weekend's action from the crowd (top right picture). This is an all-out slug-fest that sees opponents challenged to knock seven bells out of one another, as well as score some points, with nothing more than glory on offer as the prize.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Jordan Barnes</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-12T01:07:49.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Discover Calcio Fiorentino, Italy's violent 'alternative' to football</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-12T01:07:49.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Italy</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5386633/Hundreds-tussle-ball-traditional-village-match.html" title="They've all gone flipping crazy!

But he saw it fall into ruins - and aged just 11 he set up a trust in a bid to save the castle. Two decades on he discovered it was due to go to auction for £600,000 - and feared he could miss out. But just one day before the sale, the trust bought the castle thanks to funding from the National Heritage Memorial Fund. Dr Baker said: 'As a child, I would pass the castle every day to and from school, and at the age of 11 founded the castle trust. Now, 21 years later, we are in a position to purchase and realise that vision.' As a boy, Dr Baker started the Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust registered charity and fundraised to restore the castle. He also wrote a book called the Rise and Fall of Gwrych Castle aged just 14.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Mark Duell</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T22:16:12.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Doctor, 33, buys castle he saw as a child to save it from ruin</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T22:16:12.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5827891/The-surprisingly-simple-design-hacks-transform-home-minimal-effort.html" title="The surprisingly simple design hacks that will transform your home with minimal effort - and you DON'T have to spend a fortune"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5829397/Run-farmhouse-transformed-mini-mansion-goes-market-2-75m.html" title="Run-down farmhouse which was bought for £300,000 then transformed into mini-mansion based on French chateau goes on market for £2.75m "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5828323/80-story-office-building-open-World-Trade-Center-open-twin-towers-site.html" title="3 World Trade Center opens after years of delays: $2.7billion skyscraper becomes the fifth tallest building in New York "></link></item><item><title>'He let his own children see their mother’s body torn apart': Husband, who stabbed his teacher wife to death in front of their kids and then sent PHOTOS of her body to their friends, is sentenced to life in prison</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5830545/Man-sent-photos-slain-wife-gets-life-sentence.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2018 14:37:09 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5830545</guid><description><![CDATA[Massachusetts man Christopher Fratantonio, 37, was sentenced to life in prison following his first-degree murder conviction for killing his wife, Mary Fratantonio, 35, inside their home in 2017.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[
