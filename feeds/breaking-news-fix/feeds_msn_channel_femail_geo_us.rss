Minutes earlier she’d told me she’d never had an orgasm before so over the following 45 minutes I helped her climax for the first time ever. It was an amazing moment for the both of us – but it was also my job to make sure she left happy, as I was a male escort.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eight years ago I was working in London as a software engineer and enjoyed it a lot. As someone who’s always been sexually adventurous in the bedroom and keen to try new things when I hit my thirties I began to go to workshops in my spare time, to learn about things such as Tantra and bondage – anything that would add a bit more spice in the bedroom.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But then eight years ago I ended up organising a sex workshop in London for my favourite sex book author. I wrote to him and asked if I could pay him to teach. After that I went to Prague to hold a workshop myself and a woman at the workshop offered to pay me £130 for a private session. I was surprised and delighted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She admitted to me that she’d always felt quite shy when it came to sex and wanted me to give her an erotic massage – Something she’d never dared ask a partner for.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I felt very confident that I could give her exactly what she wanted. We did it in back room of the studio. When it was over, I felt so elated that I had managed to satisfy her and make her climax, I knew I could make a living out of it.</p><img id="i-1ceb90da1f59bbce" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/08/4D2678DF00000578-5833793-image-a-9_1528788515137.jpg" height="324" width="634" alt="After teaching his first workshop a female student offered to pay him £130 for a private session - Seani says he helped her to climax for the first time " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I did wonder how I would tell people what I was doing and I decided to keep it from my father. At first I kept working as a software engineer, while organising my own sex workshops in London and in my native Australia and offering my services as an escort.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These could be a ‘hands off experience' which is just chatting, or a ‘kinky boyfriend’ experience where I combine kink with intimacy such as spanking or role play or just sensual touch, sex and erotic play.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I advertised on Facebook and other websites charging from £90 an hour to £1,200 for a full day or overnight. I strictly never take my pants off in the first session so that my clients feel safe and are reassured it is all about their needs not mine. I just meet and greet them and give a massage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I never confessed to any of my engineer colleagues about my secret side job, but as my reputation grew over the next four years, I was able to give up my office job in June 2015 and work full time in the sex industry.</p><img id="i-bd8e0fa403a839ca" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/08/4D2678D500000578-5833793-image-a-10_1528788608578.jpg" height="535" width="634" alt="It initially started as Seani's 'secret side job', but soon became his full time career.

Many had experienced a string of bad relationships and want to explore sex for themselves, while others were pretty high powered women who want to surrender to their sexuality and be more submissive. I even had one famous client who appeared on TV regularly!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lots of my clients have also never climaxed before they’d been with me, which I felt was just so sad, as it’s such a natural and wonderful thing. But one of them ended up having really noisy orgasms once she discovered them, which was very funny. I meet clients at home and I remember once she practically screamed my house down while we were having sex.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When she left, my neighbours, who have no idea what I do, gave me some really funny looks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2015 I met my current partner at a Tantric sex workshop. From the start I was very open about my work with her and thankfully she’s always been very positive and encouraging. I imagine it’s because she’s also interested in exploring sex and can see that I’m helping empower women and their sexuality. She knows I practice safe sex and always use a condom.</p><img id="i-34013e7f7d4cacc0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/08/4D26789400000578-5833793-image-a-11_1528788641412.jpg" height="634" width="634" alt="The escort met his current partner at a Tantric sex workshop, and says that while she occasionally feels insecure, she is supportive of his work in the sex industry  " class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-fcad0c443a37f112" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/08/4D2685B900000578-5833793-image-a-12_1528788700577.jpg" height="1127" width="634" alt="Seani says his sessions are all about what his client needs and wants to explore " class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-85251d9f4cf9092b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/08/4D26859100000578-5833793-image-a-13_1528788726503.jpg" height="634" width="634" alt="'I make it my job to make sure they have the best possible sexual experience when they're with me,' Seani says of his clients - mostly women in their 30s and 40s " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the moment we live in different cities as she is from the Netherlands and we have a long distance love.

I am always open in conversation and while some men tell me it’s their dream job, others have accused me of lying, as I don't fit the stereotype of the buff, hairless, Chippendale type male. And I often get asked why a woman would pay for sex with me when they can just pick someone up at a bar.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have slept with around 1,000 women since I began and the truth is that if a woman is paying then the whole time it is about them and their needs and what she wants to explore.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Photographs seldom say too much, but once in a while they say everything. On Sunday afternoon the cameras clicked on a family relaxing in the sunshine at a polo match.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Naturally, the focus of this carefree sequence were the children, <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/prince_george/index.html" id="mol-76c865b0-6dd0-11e8-b208-a38a25b85f29">Prince George</a>, four, and his three-year-old sister <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/princess_charlotte/index.html" id="mol-76c8b3d0-6dd0-11e8-b208-a38a25b85f29">Princess Charlotte</a>, the royal scene-stealer-in-chief.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For once, George, so often uncomfortable in the public gaze was a picture of playful intent, whether it was swiping a ball with his cut-down polo stick, playing make-believe cowboys or just obediently watching 'papa' <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/prince_william/index.html" id="mol-76c88cc0-6dd0-11e8-b208-a38a25b85f29">Prince William</a> on horseback.</p><img id="i-4e5830c726744afb" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D24529500000578-5832775-image-a-9_1528760159376.jpg" height="640" width="634" alt="Is this, then, a snapshot of the real Kate, the way she sees herself, a royal duchess and a Middleton?" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="moduleFull"></div><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But while the young Prince and his sister with her skipping and somersaults are certainly charming, the stand-out element of this tableau of family happiness is surely the children's mother.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sitting bare-legged on the ground with sunglasses casually propped up on her head, they are the most extraordinary pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge. Extraordinary, because the way a woman looks usually reflects the way she feels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And there can be no doubt that judging from her smiling informality, Kate is feeling wonderful.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now there is surely something unexpected about this. It is, after all, only seven weeks since the birth of her third child, Prince Louis, and if the experience of her first-born children is anything to go by, the early weeks of baby No 3 have been tough.</p><img id="i-84a6c15214d1f187" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D24528900000578-5832775-image-a-13_1528760224777.jpg" height="812" width="634" alt="There was surprise that Meghan chose the off-the-shoulder look again on Saturday" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">George cried and was difficult to feed, and while Charlotte was perfect in comparison, her arrival left Kate exhausted, even irritable. With all three pregnancies she suffered from extreme morning sickness, so who could blame her if she wanted to retreat from the spotlight a little bit longer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But look closely at the pictures and at the joie de vivre that shines out. No sign of resentment at being photographed — something she has displayed in the past — no suggestion of self-pity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, there is a radiance that says: 'Here I am, the happiest woman in the world.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Is this, then, a snapshot of the real Kate, the way she sees herself, a royal duchess and a Middleton? And if so, why now? The answer lies in part with another set of pictures. These were taken 24 hours earlier, of the Buckingham Palace balcony for the Queen's official birthday celebrations, Trooping the Colour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In these, the slim Duchess in a hat that seemed to elevate her height, stands in the front row next to her father-in-law Prince Charles, towering over him. She is looking completely at ease.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Behind her is the Duchess of Sussex, slimmer — and shorter — but in a dusty pink outfit that highlighted the honeymoon glow of her shoulders.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The two women, relatives by marriage and neighbours at Kensington Palace are the pin-ups of the Royal Family, both epitomes of style and whose every outfit provokes a sales rush.</p><img id="i-8414295d99786718" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D1C8F6C00000578-5832775-Look_at_me_Three_year_old_Charlotte_impressed_Kate_as_she_showed-a-11_1528760175139.jpg" height="506" width="632" alt="Look at me! Three-year-old Charlotte impressed Kate as she showed off her gymnastic skills with a handstand - leaving her mother in fits of giggles" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Harry and Meghan gave their post-engagement interview, the prince spoke of the challenge the actress set. As he recalled, he told himself: 'I am really going to have to up my game here.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harry, it seems, has not been the only one to up their game — in palace corridors they are saying that so, too, has the Duchess of Cambridge. Just take her clothes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The casual dress she wore for the family visit to Beaufort Polo Club on Sunday that displayed her open neck owed much to the 'bateau'-style Meghan chose, not just for her wedding dress but also at Trooping. There is no doubt the couture chic of Meghan has drawn comparisons with Kate's more High Street look. In fact, the dress sense of both women is highly prized — but are they rivals?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Courtiers believe there could be a nuanced message here. As elegant and chic as Kate looked, her £39.99 Zara dress will be much more affordable to the average British woman than Meghan's high-end fashion choices.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was surprise that Meghan chose the off-the-shoulder look again on Saturday. 'She looked like she was going to a cocktail party rather than the formality of the Queen's birthday parade,' says a former palace official.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's a difficult act to pull off, and these are early days, but maybe she's trying to be a little too cutting edge. In her early days, Kate had to be subtly told not to show so much leg, so it can happen to anyone.'</p><img id="i-8d52b55bebd026f9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D1D606400000578-5832775-The_young_royal_was_seen_pretending_to_shoot_the_plastic_firearm-a-25_1528761338191.jpg" height="451" width="631" alt="The young royal was seen pretending to shoot the plastic firearm at other children and even his mother, the Duchess of Cambridge" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many at the Palace have warmed to the arrival of the American for just those reasons, of course. Kate can come across as stiff and rather formal alongside the more spontaneous and articulate Meghan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are not the first royal sisters-in-law to face critical attention. Thirty years ago, Princess Diana and the Duchess of York see-sawed between kinship and rivalry. At first, the two were friends: Diana, remember, more or less introduced Sarah Ferguson into Prince Andrew's life and after the Yorks' wedding they became close friends.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But after five years of Diana, the public were bound to be intrigued by the new arrival. And they weren't alone. Charles famously once reproached his wife, saying: 'Why can't you be more like Fergie?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The criticism stuck and Diana told photographers: 'You don't need me, you've got Fergie now.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By the time of their separations they were reconciled, only to fall out again when Fergie brought out her memoirs. But this time there was no making up and Diana was dead before there could be a rapprochement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kate, of course is not Diana, though Sunday's visit to the polo field is so reminiscent of the Princess's own weekend visits with Harry and William to watch Prince Charles play in the Eighties and early Nineties.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And any comparison between the Duchess of Sussex and Fergie, starts and ends with the fact that Meghan, too, married a younger royal prince, who also happened to be in the armed services.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, her adjustment to royal life is taking time. Insiders say she was 'very nervous' on her first appearance on the Palace balcony and Harry was a reassuring presence at her side.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Both Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have recognised that such is the scale of the change in her life from screen star to working duchess that she will need extra time to adapt.</p><img id="i-7bec262445bd70c6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D22D7E600000578-5832775-Young_royal_Prince_George_was_seen_pretending_to_shoot_the_plast-a-12_1528760187710.jpg" height="586" width="632" alt="Young royal Prince George was seen pretending to shoot the plastic firearm at other children" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They are trying to keep things light to ensure she doesn't get overwhelmed by the idea of duty,' says a friend of the Prince. 'There are protocols to observe, but they are saying that things can be done differently and no one will really raise too much of an eyebrow.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kate can be key to this. As an outsider, she knows the royal ropes, but the two women are not obvious allies. What binds them is the love and affection they have for Harry and their shared lives at Kensington Palace.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is one area where Meghan cannot compete with Kate — children. Harry yearns to become a father and the sight of George and Charlotte playing in the sunshine also carried a powerful message.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For Kate was showing that, as a member of the Royal Family, being a mother is the most important thing of all. So it may be that rather than Kate copying Meghan, Meghan will want to copy Kate. </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Is this, then, a snapshot of the real Kate (left and right), the way she sees herself, a royal duchess and a Middleton? And if so, why now? The answer lies in part with another set of pictures. These were taken 24 hours earlier, of the Buckingham Palace balcony for the Queen’s official birthday celebrations, Trooping the Colour. In these, the slim Duchess in a hat (inset) that seemed to elevate her height, stands in the front row next to her father-in-law Prince Charles, towering over him.

Several weeks later, she found herself sitting in a coffee shop, counting down the minutes until she could make her excuses and go home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another bad dating story? Not so.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thirty-one-year-old Hazel, an attractive and successful fitness instructor from Lancashire, wasn't looking for love — she was very happy with her boyfriend of a year: she was looking for friends.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She didn't have any (not close ones anyway), and as that awkward meet-up with other women in a similar situation proved, the social skills needed to set other women at ease, and relax and enjoy their company, just weren't there. And this, she is convinced, is a legacy of growing up an only child.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'My parents separated when I was four and Mum and I have been a little unit ever since,' says Hazel, who only last year moved out of her 56-year-old mother Shirley's home. 'We've done everything together, from losing weight to venturing into dating, and I wouldn't change our relationship for anything.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But the older I get, the more conscious I am that I would love to have female friends my own age. Mum has always encouraged me to try to make friends, but I've never managed to form a bond with other girls because I've always been used to entertaining myself or to Mum entertaining me.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Even at university, friendships were transient. I think if I'd had a sibling, I'd have been used to interacting with kids of my age and making friends would have been easier.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hazel's thoughts echo comments made recently by actress and model Liz Hurley, 52, who spoke of her regret at not having had another child as a sibling for her 16-year-old son Damian, whose father is U.S. businessman Steve Bing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She implied that having a brother or sister would have helped her son develop social skills which can only be learned when you are part of a brood, saying: 'I was one of three: a big sister and a little brother to squabble with and to love.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today, due to a combination of late-life motherhood and the length of time it can take a couple to feel financially secure enough to start a family, more parents than ever are sticking at one child.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The number of single child families has grown by 12 per cent in the past decade, and more than half of all British families will have just one child by 2022.</p><img id="i-74ad63f79e0d8c1e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D24C75E00000578-5832729-image-a-23_1528758482009.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="Only child Rebecca Howard Dennis with her parents. She says she is eternally grateful to her parents for sticking to one child" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The latest data from the Office for National Statistics shows that in 2016, 45 per cent of all families with dependent children (those aged under 16, or under 18 but still in education) had just one dependent child.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That compares with 42 per cent of families in 1996.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, 40 per cent of these families had two dependent children, and just 15 per cent had three or more.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some critics have warned that Britain will become a country of 'little emperors' — a phrase coined in China, where the government's rule of one child for every couple has apparently produced millions of spoilt youngsters.</p><img id="i-f8dc4f43ed7e16bb" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D24C7CC00000578-5832729-image-a-18_1528758413173.jpg" height="718" width="306" alt="34-year-old Tom Murphy, a project manager from Hampshire, grew up as an only child" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that such assumptions about only children are ill thought through and not backed up by facts at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many would argue, for example, that Hazel's social awkwardness might be due to growing up in a single parent household — although she always saw her dad at weekends — or that she might be genetically predisposed to being socially awkward.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Claire Hughes, professor of developmental psychology at Cambridge University and co-author of Why Siblings Matter, points out that there is a great deal of evidence from studies in China, suggesting that the negative effects of being an 'only one' are negligible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She goes on to explain that it is down to good parenting to ensure that children — however many siblings they do or do not have — learn to interact with others in a positive manner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The key is not to be a 'snowplough parent' — don't work too hard at sweeping any problems out of their way,' she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'As with all children, sometimes it's good for things to be a bit awkward or inconvenient for them, because then they have to work out how to overcome troubles.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Let's face it, it's not a given that a sibling relationship is going to be all sweetness and light. I know parents who have to separate their children at weekends — Mum takes one, and Dad takes the other — purely to stop them fighting.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sarah Ockwell-Smith, a mother-of-four and an only child herself, is the author of nine parenting titles, including The Gentle Parenting Book. She believes it to be wholly wrong to label or stereotype only children.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'All the research shows that our assumptions about being an only child aren't the reality,' she says. 'So, they are not less happy, they don't have more issues with friendships or with sharing and socialising.</p><img id="i-829eec2ede18d65e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D24C7BC00000578-5832729-image-a-15_1528758394031.jpg" height="456" width="634" alt="Liz Handley, 39, of Birmingham is a teaching assistant with two children - and an only child" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Whether you've got ten kids or one, they basically just need lots of love and support — and to be raised as individuals according to their character and interests. Only children who don't easily make friends would probably have struggled even if they did have siblings. It will just be part of their nature.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This argument is borne out by 34-year-old Tom Murphy, a project manager from Hampshire, who grew up as an only child. He recalls how his mother 'devoted her life' to ensuring he grew up as a sociable boy surrounded by friends.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'She took me to every sporting activity going, including tennis and football, so I'm used to being part of a team and have never had a problem walking into social situations or making friends — yet I'd have loved to have had siblings.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today, he lives with his wife Hannah, director of a fitness company, and their three children aged nine, six and two, and says: 'I would never have entertained us having only one child.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says he became acutely aware of being an only child when he was aged five, and his parents took him to Ireland to stay with his aunt and uncle, who had seven children.</p><img id="i-5e50ac176de0f0bc" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D24C76800000578-5832729-image-a-1_1528758529652.jpg" height="500" width="634" alt="Only child Liz Handley with her parents Tess and Maurice Coates in 1990" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">After that, he and his mother would spend every school summer holiday with them — and he loved nothing more than the cameraderie he experienced while spending time with his cousins.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I remember always feeling huge disappointment when we went home at the end of the summer and there was no one for me to hang out with,' he reflects.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Professor Hughes says cousins can be crucial for only children when it comes to developing social skills: 'The relationship between single children and cousins is of real interest and doesn't get enough attention. I suspect this is where many only children find companionship in China.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'A study in Ireland, where children often grow up in close proximity to their cousins, even if they've got brothers and sisters, found that they act as surrogate siblings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There's the potential for the same level of familiarity between cousins as siblings, the same enduringness to the relationship, and the same vested interest in the family as a whole.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite having cousins he is close to, Tom says his wife regularly accuses him of having what she terms 'only child syndrome'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm quite opinionated and don't tend to see other people's points of view,' he admits. 'I didn't have to learn to listen or negotiate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If I wanted to go to the park with my mother, that's where we'd go. But if I ask my chldren what they want to do, they all want different things so we have to compromise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I often have to go downstairs early in the morning to sort out a squabble over what they each want to watch on TV.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tom's father died when he was 15 and his mum died very suddenly three years ago. He confesses that being 'orphaned' has made him wish he had a sibling to share memories with and fall back on.</p><img id="i-2fbc80417087543f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D24C77000000578-5832729-image-a-21_1528758455263.jpg" height="632" width="634" alt="Hazel Walsh age 31 (right), a fitness instructor,  admits that being raised as an only child just by her mum left her without social skills" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's the part of being an only child that I've found hardest,' he says. 'From the moment Mum died, I felt like I was really on my own. It still feels so lonely.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'My wife still has her parents and grandparents alive and hasn't experienced loss yet, so I don't have anyone to talk to about how it really feels.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Teaching assistant Liz Handley, 39, shares Tom's sentiments. After her father died in 2005, she spent the next decade caring for her mother, who was diagnosed with early onset dementia. At the same time, she was juggling two young children of her own and says the stress of the situation was a factor in her marriage breaking down in 2009.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I cannot describe the difference it would have made to have a sibling to support me and help make decisions about Mum's care,' says Liz, who lives near Birmingham with her children, who are now aged 17 and 13.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'As Mum's condition deteriorated, I struggled to cope. Then, after eight years of looking after her, making the decision to put her into a care home almost broke me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'My friends were wonderful, telling me that it was absolutely the right — and safest — thing for Mum, and that her illness was so advanced that she wasn't aware of what was happening. Then, when she died in 2015, I struggled to cope with my grief. There was no brother or sister to share it with, someone who felt the same way about Mum as I did. When my daughter turned 13 recently, she asked me what I'd done on my 13th birthday. I didn't know — and didn't have anyone I could ask.'</p><img id="i-fe46419a079fc1e7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/00/4D24C73C00000578-5832729-image-a-20_1528758422866.jpg" height="686" width="306" alt="Hazel's social awkwardness might be due to growing up in a single parent household " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Beauty consultant Rebecca Howard Dennis, 38, from Primrose Hill in London, however, says she is eternally grateful to her parents for sticking to one child, as it gave her the most wonderful childhood imaginable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Because her parents didn't have to spread their attention or finances among several children, they were able to give Rebecca the best of everything, she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was supported academically and won a place at the local all-girls' grammar school in Lincolnshire, and enjoyed exotic holidays around the world.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She also became the first person in her family to go to university, studying English literature at UCL in London.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Mum and Dad gave me everything, but without spoiling me, and we travelled extensively when I was a child,' says Rebecca, who is married with two daughters aged seven and five.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We went on a road trip around America, scuba diving in the Maldives, and had holidays in Canada and Morocco.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Ultimately, it's thanks to my parents and to being an only child that I had the opportunity to study in London, then stay here and have the lovely life and career that I do.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rebecca admits that the subject of her being an only child is usually of more concern to other people, including her husband, a script writer, who is the youngest of three brothers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'On one of our first dates, he quipped that he was used to getting his own way as the baby of the family and I replied, tongue in cheek, that I was an only child so he'd got nothing on me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But I'm honestly not like that at all. I was always a great sharer of toys and so on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'People have preconceptions about only children being selfish and unsociable, which in my view are wholly naive and wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm often asked if I wish I'd had a sibling, and I'm sure I'd have loved one — but I don't recall ever longing for a brother or a sister. Mum miscarried two years after having me, so it wasn't to be.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'My parents are very much enjoying the fact that they are grandparents to two children, although they often comment, watching the girls fight, that they're relieved they never had do adjudicate over sibling squabbles.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having had Rebecca young, her parents are still only 61 and 66, so she has yet to deal with the one aspect of being an only child that is impossible to avoid — coping with their deaths in the absence of a sibling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I do worry that when they're no longer here, I will be utterly bereft. We're so close in life that in death it will be incredibly hard.

She had the 12-year-old share her account of what happened and how she felt. The young girl said kids were crying and holding each other, and they were all worried that they were about to die. The school was put on lockdown because of an intruder, but students weren't told what was happening and had to remain quiet and hidden. Wine-Thyre said after school, the class was still 'visibly shaken and giddy' and holding each other. Also last week a picture of a lockdown-themed nursery rhyme hanging up in a Somerville, Massachusetts kindergarten class went viral. Sung to the tune of Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star, it teaches young children what to do in case of an active shooter.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Charlie Lankston</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-11T15:11:53.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>12-year-old's account of what happened when her school was on lockdown</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-11T15:11:53.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>California</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5821549/Sheriff-Ex-student-makes-threat-shoot-Ohio-school.html" title="Cops find an AR-15 and 500 rounds of ammunition at home of high school dropout who threatened to shoot up his old school  "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5821835/More-schools-buying-mass-shooter-insurance-policies-following-year-dozens-student-deaths.html" title="More schools are now buying mass shooter insurance policies following a year of dozens of student deaths and injuries"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5821939/Parents-Plano-massacre-victims-sue-bar-served-drunk-shooter.html" title="Parents of Plano massacre victims sue the bar that served drunk shooter before he opened fire at his estranged wife's home and killed eight"></link></item><item><title>'When I'm feeling fire, I let the world know!'

I wondered if I would ever get a chance to date her. We were friends for a while and luckily she said yes.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Amal is a big emailer,' Vogue magazine revealed, describing how romance grew, 'and George responded with a clownish gambit, writing her notes, supposed to be from of his dog Einstein, claiming to be trapped in various places and in need of legal rescue.'</p><img id="i-57ebebd91e0afad2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/22/4D1DF53A00000578-0-image-a-45_1528667904207.jpg" height="388" width="634" alt="The tenderest touch: Their public love-in last Thursday" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter George confirmed the story, saying that the dog, a cocker spaniel, claimed he was being held hostage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The dog has since died but is immortalised in a painting which sits on their mantelpiece.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He is 'dressed as a physics professor' and standing in front of a blackboard.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their next meeting was at the Abbey Road studios in London — where George was recording a film soundtrack and invited her along. He had hoped the venue would make him seem cool, and was deflated when Amal said she had just been visiting the Muslim Brotherhood while he was trying to impress her with a 'dumb movie score'.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>'HIS SMILE ALWAYS MAKES ME MELT'</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I met George when I was 35 and starting to become quite resigned to the idea that I was going to be a spinster.' Amal told the American Film Institute on Thursday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Then we met and started hiding out in my London flat and very soon it felt like, no matter what happened, I would never want to be with anyone else. He is the person who has my complete admiration and also the person whose smile makes me melt every time. My love, what I have found with you is the great love I always hoped existed and seeing you with our children Ella and Alexander is the greatest joy in my life.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">George is even more complimentary. He told an interviewer: 'Look, it's good to surround yourself with anybody who is smarter than you, and for me the bar's pretty low anyway. But Amal is way up there. She's brilliant.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Accepting an award at the 2015 Golden Globes, George oozed: 'Amal, whatever alchemy it is that brought us together, I couldn't be more proud to be your husband.'</p><img id="i-a8babc6ff8cb4f70" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/22/4D1DF53E00000578-0-image-a-47_1528667913413.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Cheek to cheek: A mooch in Cannes" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>LOVE OF GIRAFFES SEALED THE DEAL</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A visit to Kenya together in February 2014 sealed their love. 'Amal loves giraffes; they're her favourite animal,' said George. 'She went to this place called Giraffe Manor, where the giraffes stick their heads through the windows and kiss you.' Back in LA, he showed a photo to his actor friend Ben Weiss.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I had a picture of her, looking back, smiling at these giraffes, and I said: 'I think I'm going to ask her to marry me.' And Ben said: 'I think that's a good idea.' '</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For Clooney — previously married to actress Talia Balsam — it was quite a step, having spent decades dating cocktail waitresses, party girls and even a professional wrestler.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He told Vogue: 'If you know anything about my crazy life, you know that I'd pretty much committed to the idea of never marrying again, but I started dating Amal, and I immediately knew that something was very different.'</p><img id="i-6ad560d2fdc885a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/23/4D1DF54200000578-5827827-True_romance_George_kisses_Amal_s_hand_at_a_Disney_party_in_Cali-a-5_1528669388312.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="True romance: George kisses Amal's hand at a Disney party in California" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>HARD TO GET UP AFTER PROPOSING</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One evening in April 2014, George made them both dinner. 'I did pasta of some form, not that impressive. And then over champagne, after dinner, I told her there was a lighter to light the candle in the drawer, and she reached back and pulled out a ring.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And I did all the stuff, got down on my knee and did all the things you're supposed to do,' he told CBS News in 2015.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The reaction was not quite what he expected. 'She's like: 'Holy s**t!' And she just kept staring at the ring, going: 'Oh, my God.' It was 20 minutes of me on my knee, waiting for her to say yes, because she was so shocked.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In another telling, the wait was even longer: 'She just kept saying: 'Oh my God,' and 'Wow' — completely unexpected. Finally I said, 'Listen, I'm 52 and I've been on my knee now for about 28 minutes, so I gotta get an answer out of this or I'm going to throw a hip out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I might not be able to stand back up.' The couple married in Venice in September 2014.</p><img id="i-8dd0505661aa634e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/15/4C6BCDF400000578-5747613-Yummy_mummy_The_human_rights_lawyer_styled_her_brunette_locks_in-a-121_1526738718554.jpg" height="774" width="962" alt="Yummy mummy: The human rights lawyer styled her brunette locks into a curly blow-dried hairdo, which was elegantly swept to the side" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>NEXT COMES THEIR OWN COAT OF ARMS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is a couple who seem to be so keen on their brand that they are working up to getting their own coat of arms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They have 'A&amp;G' monogrammed on everything — from the robes in their pool house to Amal's hat boxes. Guests at their wedding were sent home with an iPod each, loaded with George's playlist, and monogrammed with 'A&amp;G' as were the napkins at the wedding feast.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And just in case they were in danger of forgetting whose wedding they had attended, they also took home a photograph of the happy couple in a silver frame.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the wedding, Amal presented George with some cufflinks with the word 'George' written on them in Arabic. At their UK home in Sonning, Berkshire, there is a sculpture which features the initials A and G intertwined.</p><img id="i-dc6075888b22036e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/23/4D09F72100000578-0-Amal_Clooney_speaks_a_the_Life_Achievement_Award_Gala_Tribute_to-a-50_1528668056390.jpg" height="456" width="634" alt="Amal Clooney speaks a the  Life Achievement Award Gala Tribute to her husband George" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>HE CALLS TWINS 'KNUCKLEHEADS'</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Quality time with their twins Ella and Alexander is spent between 6am and 8am when they join the couple in bed. Amal says that she doesn't arrange any phone calls until later in the morning so all four of them can be together as a family without any interruption.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is a team of staff who look after them: a nanny, a chef, an assistant and other household staffers. George calls the twins 'the knuckleheads'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Amal said on Thursday night that, having come late to fatherhood, he is a wonderful dad. She said: 'You fill our home with laughter and that's even before the children have worked out that 'Da-da' is Batman, a talking fox and friends with Mary Poppins. I'm so proud of you, my love.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>HER FASHION IS 'CRAZY AND FUN'</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Amal was quite a clothes horse before she and George were married, but has evolved into a fashion icon and is often seen in terrifyingly expensive couture.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not everyone is a fan of some of her more out-there choices. Last month she stepped out in New York wearing a pair of £1,500 Alexander Wang trousers, made to look like frayed denim hotpants worn over leather leggings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even when riding with George on his motorbike in Los Angeles, she puts on Stella McCartney wedges. George said: 'It's amazing, because she's always, since the day I met her, had this insanely . . . it's eccentric but it's fun, sense of fashion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'How she does it while she's got 11 cases she's working on, and she was teaching at Columbia, and she's still like: 'I want to wear that dress.' It's crazy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It has been fascinating to watch, because she has such great taste.'</p><img id="i-3ea73c64aa5d412c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/10/16/4B0434F800000578-5599147-image-a-4_1523372960054.jpg" height="469" width="634" alt="Beauty and brains: Amal revealed George wooed her with emails in the voice of his dog Einstein" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><strong>A PHOTO BOOTH FOR WILD PARTIES</strong><strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The couple enjoy the use of four homes — George's lakeside house in Como, a new apartment in New York, where Amal is a visiting professor at Columbia Law School, his old bachelor pad in Los Angeles, and their large mansion house in Sonning, which sits on the banks of the Thames and boasts a 16-seater cinema, a pool house with a bar and a photo booth for parties.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The booth produces two copies of every image — one goes up on a bulletin board at the house and the other is given to the guest. George said: 'You can tell the ones that are from 3am, with people in bathrobes. Then there are ones that are just, like, George in a hat.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>AMAL SCREAMS AT HIS RACY EMAILS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, George said he and former President Barack Obama are such good friends that they exchange raunchy text messages.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: 'I have over the years with my friends said a lot of really [outrageous things].

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The set-up is guaranteed to bring today’s helicopter parents out in hives — hordes of gleefully unfettered pre-schoolers charging about outdoors, jumping in puddles, brandishing pointy sticks, even toasting marshmallows on campfires.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Welcome to Little Forest Folk, <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-bb14c9a0-6cf1-11e8-aceb-b7644e3d74a4">London</a>’s first outdoor nursery. Yes, an outdoor nursery. In which children aged from two to five learn and play outside in a wild part of Wimbledon Common from 9.30am to 3.30pm, rain or shine, which — inevitably — means a fair bit of rain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mumpreneur Leanna Barrett, co-founder of Little Forest Folk, believes it’s generally adults who don’t like rain — youngsters love jumping in puddles.</p><img id="i-89bcb2a643f370e4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/20/4D1D8B3200000578-5827539-image-a-6_1528660556898.jpg" height="449" width="634" alt="Children play together outside at Little Forest Folk in Wimbledon, which is London’s first outdoor nursery" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Children don’t tend to notice or feel weather as much as adults. We provide Scandinavian outer layers and each week send parents an email detailing the weather the coming week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There’s an old Scandinavian proverb: “There’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing.” We wholeheartedly agree” ’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And she’s far from alone. Earlier this month Ofsted’s Amanda Spearman gave a speech in which she underlined the importance of encouraging young children to ‘do what children do best. Running, jumping, skipping, scooting and climbing’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even the country’s two most prized nonagenarians, the Queen and Sir David Attenborough, are fans.

We were living in London and it was not the way we had grown up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘She would be banging on the patio doors and playing on this tiny patch of grass. We wanted her to have a childhood like we’d had, but we didn’t want to move to the country.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leanna, 40, grew up in Merthyr in Wales, while James, 39, was from the countryside in New South Wales in Australia. She returned to work as an analyst in the Home Office when Ella was nine months old, and the couple discovered that the kind of childcare they wanted for their daughter simply didn’t exist.</p><img id="i-2b46b5bb45905f47" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/21/4D1E35E400000578-5827539-image-a-10_1528661921773.jpg" height="951" width="634" alt="The innovative nursery was founded by Leanna (pictured) and James Barrett who said they took inspiration from Scandinavian education" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We thought we needed to create some way of her being outdoors all day long. We liked the Scandinavian system. We wanted to do something like that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I must have been Googling and we talked briefly about moving to Scandinavia so that she could have that type of education. Then we kept coming back to “but we like our lives here”,’ recalls Leanna, who talks nine to the dozen and fizzes with energy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When their second child, Jack, arrived in 2013, they decided to make this dream a reality. Leanna did not return to her job, and they drew up a business plan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Everyone thought it was crazy! Even my NCT group. A couple of them thought it was great, most of them thought it was a nice concept, but they said they would never send their own children there.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It was an unheard of thing then — now it is much more popular,’ says Leanna.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">None of the banks would lend the couple any money and they didn’t qualify for a government start-up loan either because you have to have been trading for three months before you can apply, which was impossible in their case.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘So we decided that we would remortgage the house. We thought: “We are doing this to try to get our kids to have an outdoor childhood. So if the worst thing happens and it completely fails and we lose all the money, we’ll sell the house and we’ll move to the country so our kids are still outdoors.” ’</p><img id="i-6dd160e6818f95ae" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/20/4D1DDADF00000578-5827539-image-a-8_1528660691361.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="They were forced to remortgage their house as none of the banks would lend them any money and they didn’t qualify for a government start-up loan" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">At this point James was still working as a policy adviser in the Department of Energy and Climate Change. ‘He was our accountant, Finance Director and everything else by night,’ recalls Leanna.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With the money and the drive to succeed, the couple were half-way there, but what they needed was a suitable site.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Opening in Wimbledon was really hard, as there was nothing like this anywhere. We just had to keep on talking to Merton Council,’ Leanna says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In January 2015, the first Little Forest Folk opened in Wimbledon with Leanna, three staff and ten children (including Ella).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The children would play outside all day whatever the weather, dressed in their brightly coloured Didriksons waterproof dungarees, jackets and waterproof boots. (Hoods and tarps would be put up if it rained.)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the first year, James was still working and I was trying to run the business with Jack [then 21 months] with me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘A lot of the time I couldn’t do stuff in the day as I’d have to look after him, so I’d have to do things when he was sleeping or at night.

Naturally these were (and still are) healthy, seasonal and homemade.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘One of my long-standing memories of how hard that time was is making fish croquettes with morning sickness. It was horrible!’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leanna’s far too busy to be cooking for the nurseries these days. That important job has gone to one of the mothers at Ella’s primary school, who now cooks breakfast, snacks, lunches and dinners for their five nurseries in Wimbledon, Barnes, Wandsworth, Chiswick and Fulham. What started as a couple’s dream, and a ragtag crew of ten children has blossomed into 120 children, 63 staff and five sites.</p><img id="i-b18f84ebf74683d7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/21/4D1E703300000578-5827539-image-a-11_1528663327370.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="As well as the branch in Wimbledon, they now run nurseries in Barnes, Wandsworth, Chiswick and Fulham" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The fees range from £62-£93 per day depending on the site, with 12.5 per cent of places being free of charge to children from deprived backgrounds. Not that it has been plain sailing. ‘When I was in labour with Indie, James got the call that the Wandsworth site we were meant to be opening had just decided to change their mind. Thank goodness he didn’t tell me. He was really weird during the labour and part of me was thinking: “What is wrong with you?” But then you don’t pay attention after a while. He didn’t tell me for a month.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leanna worried for the first six weeks after having Indie that she would find it hard to get back her enthusiasm for the project. ‘It only works at this intensity because we love it,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What’s more, she spent two weeks in intensive care after giving birth, for HELLP syndrome (a form of pre-eclampsia), on top of a pregnancy involving obstetric cholestasis and gestational diabetes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then came the call for their first Ofsted inspection when Indie was just six weeks old. Leanna had to go to the Wimbledon site with her baby strapped to her. But it was worth it — the nursery was certified as outstanding by Ofsted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What Leanna and James started has now become something of an educational movement, and they are inundated with requests to open more nurseries. Being outside certainly stirs the creative juices. Leanna recounts how a group of little boys at the Wimbledon nursery made a time machine out of a palette, bin lids, ropes and log stumps so they could go back in time and compare the Cretaceous period with the Jurassic period.</p><img id="i-ea9fd6866aa838cf" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/21/4D1E704D00000578-5827539-image-a-12_1528663335758.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The couple are now planning on building on their success and want to open a project-based primary school in January 2019" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘When they said they were going to the Jurassic period, the adults suggested they got their faces painted and they all went and hid in the bushes and played dinosaurs for a while.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Winning the Queen’s Award for innovation 2018 has been the icing on the cake. ‘We get to go to Buckingham Palace for a reception on June 28,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Palace will also send someone to one of the nurseries (probably Chiswick) to present the award. ‘That is when we can get all the parents along,’ says Leanna, beaming with pride.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not content with revolutionising nursery education, the couple plan to open a project-based primary school in January 2019.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The school will start with 16 reception age and 16 years one, two and three children, who will learn in mixed age groups. Leanna has spent the past few months penning the curriculum and plans to be headmistress while it gets off the ground.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jack and Ella, now five and seven, will be among the school’s founding pupils.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Essentially everything I am doing is for my own children,’ jokes Leanna, but luckily hundreds of other youngsters benefit along the way.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Come rain or shine, children at the Little Forrest Folk nursery in Wimbledon, London spend all day outside (pictured left).

<p class="mol-para-with-font">When it comes to drinking wine, there a few things the experts know that can make all the difference.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For instance, you may have always wanted to know just why you swirl a wine before tasting or how to truly appreciate a great glass of champagne.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Caitlyn Rees, head sommelier at <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://merivale.com/venues/freds">Fred’s </a>and <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://merivale.com/venues/charlieparkers">Charlie Parker's</a>, told FEMAIL that wine appreciation is built on the  5S technique (sight, swirl, sniff, sip, and savour). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Australian wine expert said the method, one that's easy-to-learn, offers a simple guide for understanding wine - even if you're a total beginner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, FEMAIL takes a look at the award-winning sommelier's top wine-tasting tips and why those in the know always swirl their glass. </p><img id="i-bfb0c52e273c77d9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/03/4D19095500000578-0-image-a-132_1528597638383.jpg" height="391" width="634" alt="Award-winning sommelier Caitlyn Rees (pictured) said wine appreciation is built on the 5S method - sight, swirl, sniff, sip, and savour" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Step 1: See</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before you even down that first sip, you first need to take a look at the wine in your glass, the expert said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'See refers to the appearance of the wine.

That's why we have ears that stop hearing, throats vulnerable to choking and skin that is easily damaged. What, I wondered, if we could shed bits of evolutionary baggage and seize the best that the animal kingdom has to offer? Can an octopus open our eyes to better vision, and could a kangaroo teach us something about childbirth?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Inspired by dogs, cats, cephalopods, fish, swans and chimps, my model has a better heart with more arteries than a human being, lungs that are more efficient, eyes with no blindspots, ears that pick up sound better, legs that are more efficient, and reptilian skin which reacts fast to block damaging ultraviolet rays.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My pale skin probably developed when my forebears lived in the cold northerly latitudes where there was very little sun. But it means that it is easily damaged by the sun's ultraviolet rays, leaving it vulnerable to premature ageing and skin cancer. I opted for amphibious skin. It changes instantly from light to dark to let in light or to block ultraviolet rays.</p><img id="i-68e84b090b628e39" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/21/4D17A31600000578-5825103-image-m-5_1528577290508.jpg" height="675" width="632" alt="Having given birth to two children, Alice says she is a big fan of having the kangaroo's pouch (stock image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our lungs aren't a great design either. They do the job of getting oxygen to our brain and vital organs, but the way they are constructed means we have never quite got rid of the old air before we breathe in the new.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Birds have a different set-up that involves air being drawn into air sacs in the abdomen and chest. They contract to keep the air flowing through the passageways of the lungs in one direction. In other words, they don't have to breathe out. It makes absorbing oxygen into the blood and getting rid of carbon dioxide more efficient.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, there are losses as well as gains.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I traded agility for speed when I altered my legs and replaced my feet – and that means my chances of climbing a mountain are zero.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I think it's worth it – even though I screamed when I saw the final 3D model of my creation, made for BBC4 and the Science Museum by anatomical artist Scott Eaton and special-effects model-maker Sangeet Prabhaker.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On reflection, I don't like the look of the bird-like legs.

A gastric band is a radical, surgical operation that reduces the available space in the stomach. But even people that have thought about having one, can’t face the surgery or the expense. This is where my Hypnotic Gastric Band can help you. A Hypnotic Gastric Band is a psychological procedure that helps to convince the unconscious mind that a gastric band has actually been fitted, so the body behaves as if it were physically present.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This, in turn, allows you to eat less and feel completely satisfied. You can leave food on your plate and you don't feel like you are missing out. You can enjoy your food and still lose weight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is how it works - alongside this text you are reading now, there is a 25-minute hypnotic trance that you can listen to, here at Mail Online for the next 7 days for free. There's no physical surgery, no scarring and no forbidden foods. All you have to do is follow all the instructions and let me help you lose weight.</p><video preload="none" id="5611393301747512879" title="British hypnotist Paul McKenna's gastric band technique" poster="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/09/4CBF08F900000578-0-image-m-12_1527668968962.jpg">

  </video><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over the years, I have done a great deal of research into how the body works and how it is influenced by psychological processes such as visualization, mind-programming and hypnosis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some people wonder how good they are at visualizing. It is actually very easy. Try this experiment. Think of your front door. Which side is the lock on? To answer that question, you called to mind a picture of your door. That is visualization, and we can all do it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Visualization can radically affect your body. When you imagine something stressful, your body releases adrenaline and your muscles tense up. When you imagine something relaxing, your body chemistry changes and your muscles relax.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a similar way, when you imagine you have gone through a procedure in which your stomach has shrunk from the size of a melon to the size of a tennis ball, it actually affects the signaling system of the body, so that after a just few mouthfuls, you begin to feel comfortably full. Curious as this may seem, the result is that even though you know you have not had a physical operation, your body responds as though you have, and a gastric band is in place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am now going to explain, just briefly, some of the key points of your digestive process and how a Hypnotic Gastric Band helps you to lose weight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As you begin to chew your food, the saliva begins breaking it down and your stomach prepares to receive it by releasing hydrochloric acid. When it gets to your stomach, it is broken down more and the acid kills off any unwanted bacteria. Next, the food goes into your small intestine where another set of enzymes break down the proteins, peptides, fats and starches even further. The molecular chains are now small enough to pass through the walls of your intestine and be taken into your bloodstream and your liver. In the large intestine, water and various salts and chemicals are reabsorbed into the body and the remaining waste is excreted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All of this is controlled by a set of hormones and many of them do more than one job. For example, GLP1, which tells your brain that you have had enough to eat, also slows down the release of acid in the stomach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The vital point is that when we fit your Hypnotic Gastric Band, we are not just reducing the available space in your stomach, we are also carefully recalibrating the hormonal and nervous signaling system which governs your digestion and how full you feel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is why it is so effective, because it communicates directly with all these interlocking processes, which are controlled by the unconscious mind. Your psychological gastric band will recalibrate your feeling of fullness at a physiological level.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Satiety is another word for fullness. It is a very specific and important feeling, but if you have been dieting or over-eating, your awareness of it may have become confused. In order to help you get back in touch with it, I'd like you to try a little thought experiment now.</p><img id="i-b82b4e78a7dd2b12" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/16/4CBAC00C00000578-5783239-As_part_of_his_Slim_Down_For_Summer_series_Paul_McKenna_is_givin-m-5_1527607337784.jpg" height="1162" width="634" alt="As part of his Slim Down For Summer series Paul McKenna is giving readers healthy eating tips " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">First of all, think of a time when you were absolutely stuffed: so full that it was uncomfortable and maybe you felt bloated and even a bit nauseous.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, think of a different time, a time when you were ravenous, so hungry that it was almost an ache in your stomach and you felt empty and desperate for something to eat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">OK, now, remember feeling stuffed again…</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, desperately hungry…</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Go back and forth between these two memories and notice how different they feel to you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So long as you can tell the difference between feeling stuffed and feeling starving, your mind has all it needs to begin the process of recalibration.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your unconscious mind will use these memories when you listen to the Hypnotic Gastric Band to reset your feeling of satiety and give you a clear sense of the many stages available between these two extremes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You never ever need to go to either of these extremes again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From now on, you will find that you notice the fullness feeling more easily and more often. In the old days, you may have ignored or passed this point without paying it much attention. With your Hypnotic Gastric Band fitted, you will reach this point more quickly, so it is important to look out for it, to avoid unnecessary discomfort. If you are at all unsure, just pause and stop eating for three or four minutes and then check how you feel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your unconscious mind will make the fullness come more swiftly, clearly and urgently as a result of your Hypnotic Gastric Band.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When you listen to the hypnotic trance, it is perfectly all right if you consciously listen to every word but it does not matter if you cannot consciously remember a word. What you do or don't remember is not important, because the language in the mind-programming technique is directed towards your unconscious mind, which hears everything it needs to hear.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many people have been sceptical when they have used these psychological techniques to lose weight and change their lifestyle, and it is important to keep whatever scepticism you have until you have truly proven to yourself that you have achieved success with these tools and you do not have to believe in anything to benefit from them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, listen to the Hypnotic Gastric Band trance and look forward to feeling lighter and fitter and enjoying your new thinner body!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For information about Paul McKenna’s new online weight loss course <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.paulmckennaonline.com/slimdownforsummer">click here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>EXCLUSIVE: Slim Down For Summer.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Picture an adulterer and who do you see? There’s a high chance you’re thinking of a middle-aged man, perhaps with a history of broken marriages.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This might be the popular image of someone who cheats but, as a psychiatrist with two decades’ experience in treating sexual issues, I can tell you that the profile of a modern adulterer is much more complex and nuanced.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For one thing, while men are having affairs at the same rate as they’ve done for the past two decades, today a cheater is more likely than ever before to be female. There’s a good chance that he or she will be a high earner, aged between 40 and 60. However, affairs are also increasingly prevalent among the younger and, perhaps more surprisingly, the older generation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet, strange as it sounds, it’s quite possible today’s adulterer is happily married. In recent surveys, more than a third of cheating women and half of cheating men say they are perfectly content with their long-term relationships — but cheat anyway.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While we would all like to think we’d never cheat, it’s not an isolated activity confined to a few essentially ‘unfaithful’ people.</p><img id="i-cee9f32f34286d1c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/01/4D10ABF700000578-5823455-image-a-52_1528503536173.jpg" height="303" width="634" alt="In recent surveys, more than a third of cheating women and half of cheating men say they are perfectly content with their long-term relationships — but cheat anyway (stock pic)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In simple terms, we become more likely to cheat if we are given the opportunity — and modern life is giving us more and more opportunity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, I believe seismic sexual shifts in society are remodelling the landscape of infidelity. This is especially true for women, whose attitudes have undergone the most radical change as they have gained social and sexual freedom.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS femail" data-version="2" id="mol-af26c000-6b78-11e8-8039-fb00eeb6580a">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Is it an emotional affair? </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Emotional affairs are controversial, with some experts claiming that a lack of sexual contact means no betrayal has taken place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet an intense emotional bond with another can create a schism between primary partners that can feel even more invasive than a sexual one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, what are the signs that you’ve fallen into an emotional affair with that online buddy or work friend?</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Women used to be cruelly cast out for having extra-marital affairs. Literature tells stories of ‘fallen women’, such as Hester Prynne (in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel The Scarlet Letter, she’s forced to wear a red A for ‘adultery’), Anna Karenina and Madame Bovary, who suffered greatly for their sexual and romantic desires.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet women are now more than levelling the playing field with men over breaking marital bonds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even a few decades ago, women cheated only half as often as men. One highly respected study reveals that while the number of married men who have ever cheated remained stable at around 20 per cent from 1993 through to 2016, among women of all ages there is a definite upward trend.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 1993, just 10 per cent of women admitted to cheating. Now, the figure is 15.4 per cent — roughly a 50 per cent increase. A different poll suggests women have virtually caught up with men, with 19 per cent cheating.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The most likely cause of this startling increase in infidelity among women is their long overdue economic and social emancipation — which provides more opportunities to cheat in the workplace and means women have become less reliant on men for financial support.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, while disapproval rates of infidelity are actually higher now than they were in the Seventies, women no longer face the stigma that once surrounded adultery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Surprisingly, well-paid and highly educated women are significantly more likely to cheat. Research confirms that’s especially true for university-educated women and those who earn more than £55,000 — particularly if that’s more than their husband’s salary.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why? No one can say for certain, but it may be, in part, because they feel less pressured to make bad relationships work. University-educated women are also the most likely group to instigate divorce, suggesting they feel more empowered to leave a marriage whether or not cheating has occurred.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the trend for women to have more affairs seems only to be growing among the younger generation. Research into the sexual activity of millennials suggests that since 2011, younger women have been cheating at rates comparable to men. They are also more likely to emulate typically ‘male’ behaviour, focusing on physical arousal, rather than the more typically ‘female’ desire for emotional connection.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cheating among the over-60s has also increased since 1991, by at least 10 per cent for women and 14 per cent among men — most likely thanks to longer, healthier lives and drugs that enhance sexual relations at a time when previous generations would have ‘shut up shop’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s a basic rule of cheating, which is that the easier it is to do, the more likely we will do it. Many factors — financial independence, physical health, lack of social stigma and so on — are making affairs easier than ever, with fewer consequences if we are caught.</p><img id="i-ed9fbe84459e27e7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/01/4D10AC0300000578-5823455-image-a-53_1528503561352.jpg" height="454" width="634" alt="In simple terms, we become more likely to cheat if we are given the opportunity — and modern life is giving us more and more opportunity (stock pic)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">And there’s another powerful modern tool for a potential cheater: the internet, which has revolutionised the ease of forming emotional or sexual connections outside of marriage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Infidelity isn’t confined to secret rendezvous in hotels any longer. Today’s philanderer can be sharing a meal with their spouse while sending texts to their lover.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although, over time, many of us lose the intense feeling of being in love with our partner, we rarely lose our desire to be in love and lust again. Without exception, all of my unfaithful patients have used the internet to meet new lovers. And since women tend to be more adept on social media — U.S. research shows 73 per cent use it, compared with 65 per cent of men — it’s a path to infidelity with which they are perhaps more likely to feel comfortable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The internet enables not only instant sexual gratification, but instant intimacy, whether it’s chatting to a stranger or rekindling a friendship with a forgotten flame.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For those feeling dissatisfied or simply a bit bored in their current relationship, it’s all too easy for an online connection to develop into an emotional affair that activates the powerful desire centres in our brains. Sex may not be on the table — but it’s generally under the table and that can create a powerful bond.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS femail" data-version="2" id="mol-a8108570-6b79-11e8-8039-fb00eeb6580a">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Beware 'pain shopping' </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">When you suspect you’ve been betrayed by your spouse, you may feel an almost irresistible urge to cause yourself even more pain by seeking out damning evidence of their infidelity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In my experience, people spend sleepless nights reviewing phone records, going through pockets or sneaking on to their other half’s computer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And I understand why betrayed spouses would do this. However, this relentless hunt for the sordid details may devolve into what experts call ‘pain shopping’ — because you are looking for further heartache.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While it’s understandable behaviour, ultimately it’s counter-productive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Pain shopping’ is the mind’s way of trying to understand how someone you trusted could hurt you. There are few traumas in life as devastating as discovering that your partner has been cheating.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’ve had several patients contemplate suicide after learning of a spouse’s infidelity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One ended up in a psychiatric hospital, tied to a trolley.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s not because their spouse was so wonderful, it’s because their deeply human need to feel loved has been disrupted. Just as love is the strongest addiction — the most intense stimulator of the brain’s reward system — losing love can plunge us into painful withdrawal and panic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Constant scrutiny of emails, credit card bills and the like turns people into what I call ‘surveillance monsters’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Turning into a dogged Sherlock Holmes is more likely to destroy a marriage than help it, not to mention the distress — so it’s important for the cheated-on spouse to exercise the self-control necessary to keep themselves from digging for painful detail. Doing so can only bring anguish and pose a barrier to any possible reconciliation. </p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, an emotional affair can prove more threatening to a marriage than a sexual affair, due to the way it destroys existing emotional bonds. The chemical rush caused by the affair means you idealise the new lover and turn against your partner — a process psychologists call ‘splitting’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over my career, I’ve come to understand that emotional fidelity is the most overlooked aspect of relationship happiness. When an affair is discovered, the emphasis is usually on sexual fidelity, but I think loss of emotional fidelity is more destructive to relationships.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I define it as committing to keep your partner as the central person in your life — your main source of connection and primary confidant. People don’t fall in love because they have great sex, they fall in love because of emotional fidelity and their intention to continue it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And emotional affairs pose the greatest possible threat to this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Women, in particular, find it hard to accept if their partner has an emotional affair, while men struggle more if infidelity is physical.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, of course, one can lead to the other. At least one expert says that as many as 80 per cent of emotional affairs will lead to physical encounters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What drives people to cheat hasn’t changed down the generations — it’s a combination of biology and opportunity. After all, our brains are programmed by millions of years of evolution to seek sex and love with life-and-death desperation — and it’s not just faithful sex in a long-term relationship that we crave.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Genetic diversity is good for the human species, making us taller, healthier and smarter. So our brains have evolved to prompt us to chase new and different sexual partners, instead of the ‘safe’ people we seek out when it comes to marriage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One study even found that women married to men who shared similar genes related to their immune systems had more affairs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The truth is that most people live in the grey zone when it comes to fidelity and anyone could fall prey to the temptations modern life is only too keen to provide.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So if you ask the question: ‘Who is an adulterer?’, the answer really should be: ‘Any one of us.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> <span class="mol-style-italic">For more information, visit <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://drkenrosenberg.com/">drkenrosenberg.com</a></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Adapted by Clare Goldwin from Infidelity: Why Men And Women Cheat, by Kenneth Paul Rosenberg MD, published by Da Capo Press at £18.99.

The trendy teen held onto a black hoodie and a Fiji water bottle and avoided looking at the cameras as she made her way down the sidewalk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The college student may have just come from — or was going to — a workout, since she wore leggings with the SoulCycle logo on them. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Though she is most often seen with straight hair, this week she was rocking new braids, which were half pulled up behind her head.

Braids stay in place regardless of the weather or humidity. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The teen appeared to have added some length to the braids with extensions, which are often woven into this kind of style, and she chose to leave the ends unbraided, and in loose curls that fell below her shoulders. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Malia has worn her hair in braids before — as has her mom. In fact, just a couple of weeks ago, Michelle Obama shared a throwback snap of herself in college sporting a similar style.</p><div>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">When it comes to make-up, it’s tit for tat in our house. Thanks to my job as a beauty editor, my girls Molly and Beth have always known that my office is the place to raid for expensive pieces of make-up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what they don’t know is that — when I’m on the hunt for a new product — I’ll sneak a peek at their make-up stash.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Teenagers don’t usually take make-up too seriously. They see the cosmetics aisle as a huge playground and are keen to experiment. It’s an attitude we tend to forget when we’re older. But best of all — these products can be less than £5. A mascara doesn’t have to cost £20 to give a high-end result.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Often you are paying for the expensive packaging on pricey mascaras,’ says make-up artist Wendy Snowdon, who works with celebrities and on film sets. Wendy believes cheap products are great for encouraging women to step outside their make-up comfort zone.</p><img id="i-1f827c5f5113e60d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/20/4CFC473100000578-5813621-image-m-2_1528315140086.jpg" height="474" width="634" alt="British beauty expert Alice-Hart Davis revealed the best inexpensive cosmetics for giving this season's bright colour make-up trend a go (file image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There’s a big trend for bright colour this summer — and teen brands are an inexpensive way of having a go,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many brands also have websites with videos on how to use the products. So here’s my pick of the products worth adding to your make-up bag . . .</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>FLATTERING BLUSHER</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sleek Makeup is an innovative brand with its finger on the pulse of make-up trends, which has helped to make it one of the fastest-growing cosmetics companies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Skip past the palettes of rose-gold highlighter powders and instead try the Cream to Powder blush in French Rose (£5.99).</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Stick with a cream blush,’ advises Wendy. ‘It’s easier to manage than powder for older, drier skin and gives a more flattering result.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Or choose the colourful Twist-Up eye pencils (£2.99) to try out this summer’s brighter-eyes trends (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://fave.co/2xW4D8m">sleekmakeup.com</a>).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>STAY-PUT LIPSTICK</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most beauty-obsessed teens have some Revolution products in their collection because they deliver impressive colour options at amazing prices.</p><img id="i-7effb4a6eb36e222" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/21/4CFC503D00000578-5813621-image-a-15_1528315345859.jpg" height="638" width="634" alt="Alice says Revolution's Pro Supreme Matte Lip Pigment (pictured)  is ideal for lip gloss that stays in place" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, its Flawless Palettes offer 32 eyeshadow colours for £8, making them some of the best value available. For a slightly more grown-up option, try their Revolution Pro line. Packaged in classy black cases, the felt-tip style Fine Gel Liquid Eyeliner is £4 and perfect for a winged eyeline.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most of all, I’m taken with their Pro Supreme Matte Lip Pigment in a scorching red called Spiritual, also £4, which has a gel formula that stays in place (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://fave.co/2xMJhuo">revolution beauty.com</a>).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>FLAWLESS SKIN</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s all about full-on make-up looks at NYX Cosmetics. Launched over here in Boots in 2014, this cult U.S. brand took the teenage market by storm — they have more than 12 million followers on Instagram. The ‘illuminating powders’ are best left to youngsters, but the brand is strong on what I call ‘make-up support’. ‘The Hydra Touch Primer is £13,’ says Wendy, ‘and it’s as good as products twice its price.’ There’s a good Proof-It Waterproof Eye Shadow Primer, £6, too (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://fave.co/2kVZmVk">nyxcosmetics.co.uk</a>)</p><img id="i-9827f7ea9d2ebbf8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/22/4CFC471500000578-5813621-Make_up_artist_Wendy_recommends_using_products_from_NYX_Cosmetic-a-33_1528320567764.jpg" height="636" width="306" alt="Make-up artist Wendy recommends using products from NYX Cosmetics such as their Hydra Touch Primer (pictured) to support looks" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-3cdf12109d87572f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/22/4CFC471A00000578-5813621-image-a-34_1528320567932.jpg" height="636" width="306" alt="Alice recommends Barry M's Gelly range for everyday manicures" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>PRETTY BRUSHES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In blue, pink or rainbow-coloured, the range of make-up brushes from Spectrum is surely the prettiest on the High Street. Their synthetic fibres also mean they are vegan friendly, a big draw for teens.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I love their So Oval You foundation brush (£7.99) for liquid foundation, and their super-soft Well Rounded brush (£8.99) for adding a light dusting of anti-shine powder. (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://fave.co/2xwv1pv">spectrumcollections.com</a>)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>BRIGHTER EYES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">W7 is a sassy London-based brand with a full range of teen-magnet products, from metallic highlighters to lip glosses. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what appeals to the mid-life eye are the eye shadow palettes, dead ringers for the expensive Urban Decay Naked range that are £39.50 each. Fetchingly styled in rectangular tins, W7 offers 12 eye shadows for just £9.95 (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://fave.co/2BKrpkf">w7cosmetics.co.uk</a>)</p><img id="i-d5062748ac4a7b80" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/10/4D01405F00000578-5813621-The_Colour_me_Buff_Eye_Palette_by_W7_Cosmetics_9_95_is_a_rival_f-a-15_1528362739965.jpg" height="390" width="634" alt="The Colour me Buff Eye Palette by W7 Cosmetics, £9.95, is a rival for Urban Decay's Naked range" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MAGICAL MASCARA</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Italian brand Kiko has stand-alone shops that are an Aladdin’s cave for make-up junkies of any age, though with bargain prices (nail lacquers from £1 and eye shadows from £2.50) many of the clientele are young.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I love the soft, glide-on eye pencils — the black Everlasting Kajal is £5.50 — and the 30 Days Extension Mascara (£7.90) which promises that if you wear it every day its active ingredients will help your eyelashes grow longer over the course of a month (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://fave.co/2kVZsMG">kikocosmetics.com</a>).</p><img id="i-64fc1df7c82f0a26" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/22/4CFC502F00000578-5813621-image-a-32_1528320462794.jpg" height="828" width="634" alt="Alice recommends eye make-up from Kiko (pictured). She revealed the active ingredients in the brand's mascara is able to lengthen lashes" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>CREATIVE NAILS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I challenge your heart not to leap as you stand at a Barry M counter, marvelling at the colours. It takes you back to being a teen. Steer clear of the face jewels and ‘glitter pots’ and try something sensible such as their All Night Long Anti-Redness Primer, £6.99, which has a smoothing effect. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And I adore the bright Nail Paint nail varnishes, though what works better for everyday wear are nudes such as Pink Lemonade or Lychee in the Gelly range (£2.99).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its mascaras are great, too — the Showgirl Extra Lengthening Mascara (£4.99) wakes up tired eyes in an instant (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://fave.co/2sLNQza">barrym.com</a>). </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>British make-up artist Wendy Snowdon revealed bright colour is set to be this summer's biggest make-up trend.

DON'T APPLY EYELINER ON THE INNER LASH LINE </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While the tightlining technique is all the rage on beauty blogs, Mr Arundel warns against this cosmetic method. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Optometrists call the fragile skin around the eyes 'periocular skin' and they have a strong opinion about where on that skin you should apply your eyeliner,' he said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There has even been a small study to set the record straight about the dangers of what beauticians refer to as 'waterlining' or 'tightlining' which is applying eyeliner inside your lower lash line.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The study quantified the migration of a conventional cosmetic eye pencil in two different locations: behind the lash line and inside the lash line (the waterline). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The results showed the glitter particles of the pencil eyeliner migrated more readily and contaminated the tear film when applied inside the waterline. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Arundel said this has 'implications for contact wearers and patients with dry eye syndrome or sensitive eyes'. </p><img id="i-c4b6d7644d4237c1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/29/09/40E818FA00000578-4551502-image-a-2_1496048207375.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Optometry Australia's resident optometrist, Luke Arundel, has seen first-hand the damage caused by cosmetic mistakes and shared his top beauty tips to help women avoid eye  damage" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. THROW OUT YOUR MAKE UP AFTER THE EXPIRY DATE </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While many people keep their make up for a long while, this could be causing serious damage to their eyes.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'A study published in the International Journal of Cosmetic Science found 97.9 per cent of participants reported using or previously using make-up after the expiration date, with mascara being the most frequently mentioned product,' Mr Arundel said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Yet, the microbiological analysis of 40 mascara samples revealed the presence of bacteria and fungi which can cause nasty bacterial eye infections.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'By law, cosmetic manufacturers don't have to put a use-by date on their products. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, you can check a product's official expiry date by running the batch code through checkfresh.com or apps like Check Your Cosmetics.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. BE CAREFUL WITH EYELASH EXTENSIONS </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eyelash extensions have skyrocketed in popularity of late... but they can be risky. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Mr Arundel, risks associated with this beauty trend include infections of the cornea and eyelid, the permanent or temporary loss of eyelashes, eyelid swelling and allergic reactions. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There has been a steady increase in the number of cases associated with allergic reactions to the glue used to adhere extensions to existing lashes, the loss of natural eyelashes, conjunctivitis and even corneal damage due to tweezer injury,' Mr Arundel said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Repeated use of eyelash extensions can cause tractional alopecia, where the natural lash falls out due to excessive tension and weight placed on the hair shaft.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This can damage the hair follicle, which can slow down or cease any further production of natural lashes.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Arundel says that if women insist on the extensions, they should ensure that their beauty therapist has been trained in this procedure, that the equipment used has been sterilised and that the environment where the procedure will take place is clean.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They should ask their therapist what glue they will use and avoid places that only use formaldehyde-based adhesives as these are often linked to allergic reactions,' he added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If there is any discomfort after the procedure, any noticeable inflammation of the eyelid, grittiness, blurred vision or loss of the natural eyelashes, you should see your optometrist immediately.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4. TAKE CARE WITH NOVELTY CONTACT LENSES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A popular accessory on Halloween, novelty contact lenses are a popular beauty buy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But they can also cause serious damage to the surface of your eye. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Halloween can be a scary time for optometrists, for all the wrong reasons. Buying novelty lenses online or over the counter can lead to eye infections, damage, and even permanent blindness,' Mr Arundel said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The surface of the eye is extremely delicate and wearing non-prescribed novelty contact lenses, particularly those from a dubious source, could cause eye damage ranging from mild infections to sight-threatening conditions such as corneal scarring and even blindness. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Contact lenses are not 'one size fits all'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It is important to make sure the lenses are prescribed by an optometrist who will measure each eye to properly fit the lenses and evaluate how the eye responds to contact lens wear using a microscope. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The optometrist will then instruct them on appropriate insertion and removal techniques and correct contact lens care to minimise the risk of irreversible eye damage.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5.

That would totally disrupt it,' she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'A lot of women who come [to LGP events] say, "I had this interaction at work that made me really uncomfortable but, you know, whatever." And people in the room are like, "No, no — hold on. Tell me about that experience." "The way you feel is legitimate." "Here's something you could do to speak up about it."'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When she asked the community if they should start integrating men 'every now and then' at events, she got 'so many emails' from members telling her not to do so.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the lawsuit, the plaintiff Rich Allison says he was 'kicked out 'of a Ladies Get Paid event held at The Red Door restaurant San Diego in August 2017, even though he registered to attend.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Allison was permitted to enter a different section of The Red Door where the event was not being hosted, however, since he was not attending the event, was not entitled to a discount being offered to Ladies Get paid and was effectively charged 'a Man Tax on drinks and services'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also likened the event to a something 'as repugnant and unlawful' as a 'Caucasian Night' or a 'Heterosexual Night'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alfred G. Rava, the attorney handling Allison's case was once a member of the National Coalition for Men, the country's oldest men's rights group and filed a second lawsuit in LA in December 2017 on behalf of a man named George St. George.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was served in January on the day of the Women's March.</p><div>

Wasserman asked. 'When will it stop?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an email to Refinery29, Rava shared that his clients come to him when they learn that a 'seemingly man-hating business' is operating in 'the progressive state of California'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I take great umbrage at businesses operating in California that treat people unequally, i.e., that favor one group of people over another, based on people's immutable personal characteristics such as race or sex,' Rava added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wasserman settled last month rather than go to trial and officially changed Ladies Get Paid's policy to admit men.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, in order to do so, she had to borrow money from her mom and also started a crowdfunding page with a $100,000 goal to help with her legal costs, and has so far raised $80,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And while most followers have been largely supportive, some woman have attacked Wasserman for settling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We had a woman who was super rude to us in an Instagram post saying, 'You realize you're giving into the patriarchy because you settled?' I was like, you have no understanding of the legal system, and you don't know how much it would have cost us to even go to court,' she explained.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It was really upsetting, especially to see a woman accuse us of not standing up to the patriarchy — because that's literally all we do as a company,' she added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We chose to settle because that was the financially prudent decision, and we want to get on with our lives.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Claire Wasserman, the founder of women-only networking and empowerment group Ladies Get Paid has revealed how a civil rights law suit forced her to allow men to attend her events.

He captioned it, 'Israel helping Trump build "The Wall"' which led to heated debate in the comments. Many people accused him of teaching racism to his son, behaving in an un-Christian way, and learning nothing from his mission trips to Central America. Last month, Derick — who is married to Duggar daughter Jill, 26 — came under fire after tweeting a rant against gay couples. He said families like that of gay TLC star Nate Berkus are 'degrading to children' and a 'perversion'. Derick has stirred up controversy with his tweets in the past, attacking TLC star and transgender teen Jazz Jennings. TLC cut ties with Derick and Jill, who have not appeared on 19 Kids and Counting spin-off Counting On for over a year.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Charlie Lankston</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-05-15T23:28:29.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Jill Duggar's husband Derick is causing controversy AGAIN</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-05-15T23:28:29.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Instagram,Donald Trump</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5731925/Lie-detecting-computers-equipped-artificial-intelligence-future-border-security.html" title="The AI that can spot illegal immigrants: Lie-detecting virtual kiosks can spot deception 'better than a human'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5726393/El-Chapos-mom-speaks-upbringing-mud-hut.html" title="Bringing up El Chapo: Mother of world's most notorious drugs baron sheds light on his childhood growing up in a mud hut as he now languishes in a US jail"></link></item><item><title>Queen Maxima of the Netherlands looks elegant in black as she attends National WWII Memorial ceremony in Amsterdam with husband King Willem-Alexander</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5692661/Queen-Maxima-Netherlands-attends-National-WWII-Memorial-ceremony.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 May 2018 19:27:32 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5692661</guid><description><![CDATA[The Dutch royal, 46, joined her husband King Willem-Alexander, 51, at the occasion held to remember all Dutch victims of war.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

The drama between the two started after he went to her show in Los Angeles last year. At the time, the two were very friendly toward one another and communicated via direct message. After seeing that James was at her concert, Ariana, 24, even said that she wished she had known he was going to be there so she could have invited him backstage. But this was also when James' self-described 'scandals' were occurring and Ariana fans were not happy that the pop singer had decided to follow him. James said: 'This was right after all my scandals started happening so I was getting a bunch of really angry tweets from her fans that were really mad that she had followed me.' Ariana, of course heard of the backlash and quickly unfollowed James.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Charlie Lankston</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-04-04T01:55:13.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>James Charles says that Ariana Grande is the 'rudest celebrity'</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-04-04T01:55:13.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>YouTube,Ariana Grande</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4966624/James-Charles-comes-fire-Pennywise-tutorial.html" title="'You are such a hypocrite!'

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Although there is good physiological reasoning and research to indicate that women really do believe that size (thickness) matters, I don't necessarily believe that this is the sole motivator for men whom are seeking this type of augmentation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Rather, in my experience with patients, it is more often something that they are doing for themselves rather than anyone else.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'As a doctor performing this procedure, it is very rewarding to see the improved levels of confidence and self-esteem in my patients.'</p><img id="i-9edfde14608b723" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/14/00/4A2A32B400000578-5497683-image-a-32_1520987489693.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="For the size increase, Dr Crimston said it all comes down do your pre-procedure penis size and the amount of dermal filler used (stock image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">So how does the  procedure work?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Crimston explained clients are provided with a strong numbing cream to apply before they meet with the doctor who will go through the procedure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'In short (no pun intended), this procedure is performed by placing dermal filler under the superficial tissue that surrounds the penile shaft,' he said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The outcome of this is a thicker and somewhat more aesthetically impressive penis. Importantly, the procedure is focused primarily on enhancing penile circumference and this "thickening" effect is maintained in both the flaccid and erect state.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The dermal filler also tends to provide an increase in length through the "scaffolding" of the superficial fascial tissue thus inhibiting retraction.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This effect however is not preserved in the erect state and therefore this is not a treatment that will increase the erect length of the penis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The aim therefore, is to achieve an aesthetically larger and thicker penis without comprising any functional properties such as sensation or erectile strength.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Crimston said increasing the penis size comes down to volume dependent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Generally men can expect a 20 to 30 per cent increase in girth,' he said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The percentage of size increase from baseline is dependent on two main factors; the pre-augmentation penis size and the amount of volume utilised during the procedure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Although somewhat counterintuitive, the smaller the baseline the more significant improvement can be achieved from a smaller volume of filler.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'In saying that however, my experience is that this procedure has produced both a reliable result and significant enhancement on penises of all shapes and sizes.'</p><img id="i-d044a3654602dff5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/14/00/4A2A2FE200000578-5497683-image-a-33_1520988809913.jpg" height="473" width="634" alt="Dr Crimston said the effects of dermal filler lasts up to two years - and it functions like a regular penis (stock image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The procedure has been popular among men from all walks of life. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There literally is no dominant demographic that I can specify.

I encourage my clients to take the "journey" approach to this type of procedure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'My preference is to provide a staged augmentation over a number of treatment sessions as I find this provides the best aesthetic outcome and allows me to engage with the patients' needs throughout the treatment process.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For anyone interested to get the medical procedure, Dr Crimston said it was important for patients to be fully aware of the risks and complications.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Although the complication rates for this method of penis enlargement are very low, it is vital that men considering this procedure are empowered to make an informed decision based on both realistic expectations and awareness of any potential adverse outcomes,' he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For more details about The Manse's Masculane procedure, please visit the <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://themanseclinic.com.au/Blog/penis-enlargement-faqs">website</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>It's an old-age question: Does size really matter in the bedroom?
