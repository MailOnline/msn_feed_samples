<p class="mol-para-with-font">The price of filling up the car with petrol soared by more than £3 last month – meaning motorists must be more vigilant than ever about fuel consumption.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The cost of both petrol and diesel rose by an average of 6p a litre in May, according to the RAC. This has been blamed on US sanctions against the major oil producer Iran as well as the pound being weaker against the dollar, which is the currency used for trading in oil.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The average cost of filling a family car up with petrol is now £71 while for diesel it has risen to £73 – costing £1.29 a litre for petrol and £1.32 for diesel. Here, we show how you can save at least £6 every time you fill up – or even pay just £1 for your fuel by investing in a new vehicle.</p><img id="i-1a7e00f899b6759e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/13/4D13682600000578-5824301-The_average_cost_of_filling_a_family_car_up_with_petrol_is_now_7-m-12_1528546412142.jpg" height="540" width="634" alt="The average cost of filling a family car up with petrol is now £71 while for diesel it has risen to £73 – costing £1.29 a litre for petrol and £1.32 for diesel" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong></p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Compare pump prices and save £6 </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The recent price hike is painful but by visiting a different petrol pump you can end up paying less money than you were before.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Websites and phone apps can provide comparison services to find the best fuel prices in your area – with costs often varying by 10p a litre or more.

The commercial manager from Bristol uses the car for a 200-mile round trip commute to Slough in Berkshire two or three times a week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thom says: ‘When you are buying a new car, spending an extra £10,000 or so on an electric vehicle seems to me like a no-brainer – you can recoup the extra cost in just over a couple of years. Being able to avoid the headache of always having to fill up at petrol stations is also a godsend.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He adds: ‘Forget those tired old jokes about electric cars being a bit like milk floats. My Tesla can do nought to 60 miles per hour in just over four seconds – faster than most traditional sports cars.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thom plugs the vehicle into his home electricity supply every night to repower it. The father of two has a couple of solar panels at home that help recharge the battery. He uses renewable energy provider Pure Planet to save money on energy bills – paying £1,000 a year on electricity for his three-bedroom home. This is £400 less than he paid after switching provider last year. The bill includes the few pounds a week for recharging. </p></div>                        </div><img id="i-c624d16f6e9d4634" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/13/4D14008D00000578-5824301-image-a-10_1528546373780.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Slow down: Driving at 80mph uses up to 25 per cent more fuel than motoring at 70mph" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong></p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Drive cautiously and pocket an extra £15 </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Motorists who enjoy the thrill of putting their foot down on the accelerator may feel less excited about the experience when they next visit the petrol pump. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Research by reviewer WhatCar? has found driving at 80mph uses up to 25 per cent more fuel than motoring at 70mph. Dramatic acceleration and sudden braking will make the car even thirstier as will not changing gear until the motor is revved up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Josh Elliott says: ‘You would be amazed how much money you can save by being a better driver. If your car has a cruise control option it is a good idea to use this as it will save you a fortune in fuel.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having calmed your inner Stirling Moss or Lewis Hamilton, there are other measures you should consider taking to be less of a gas-guzzler.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Using the air conditioning can add 10 per cent on to your fuel bill and is especially draining on the engine when you are stuck in a traffic jam. You should also check your tyres are fully inflated – to make for safer as well as more economic driving.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have a roof rack on the car this adds wind resistance that can also affect fuel efficiency by as much as 10 per cent. Even cleaning out the car and not filling up the tank completely with petrol can have an impact as the extra weight burns more fuel. </p><div>
