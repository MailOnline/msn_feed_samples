The damage was revealed this morning after the street artist earlier confirmed he was behind a mural which appeared overnight on the side of a block in Islington. The artwork in Finsbury Park shows green paint behind a bare tree to resemble foliage, with a stencil of a person holding a pressure hose depicted next to it.</figcaption><span class="copyright">None</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/10/82676147-0-image-a-10_1710931226564.jpg" /><figcaption>Locals said they felt 'proud and delighted' at the thought of the anonymous artist choosing their street for his latest mural when it emerged- though there were concerns their rents could now 'skyrocket'. BBC London journalist Anna O'Neill posted this morning on X, formerly Twitter, pictures of the vandalism to the artwork as well as a newly-installed protective fence. She wrote: 'This is why we can't have nice things. #Banksy mural defaced after just 3 days.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">Tim Clarke for dailymail.co.uk</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/10/82676155-0-image-a-12_1710931254738.jpg" /><figcaption>She followed up with an image of a fence which has now been added at the site in Hornsey Road, Finsbury Park. Trainee clinical psychologist Amy, who lives in the apartment block, also tweeted a picture of the damage. She wrote: 'Someone's vandalised the Banksy overnight. Gutted. Why can't people let a community be happy without trying to ruin it?' MailOnline asked Islington Council yesterday whether any security measures for the installation were likely, but was told there were no planned updates. Banksy fan and photographer Matt Adamiak, 42, took pictures of the artwork this morning.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Tim Clarke for dailymail.co.uk</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/10/82676145-0-image-a-13_1710931366288.jpg" /><figcaption>Matt, from Southampton, said: 'I've always been a Banksy fan so when I saw he'd been out and about I headed up the motorway this morning to have a look. I got there at 6am this morning as it was getting light, there was hardly anyone around - then I noticed someone had thrown white paint or something over it. It's massively noticeable in person - looking at the way it's been thrown it looks like someone's climbed over the fence to throw it. It's difficult to tell how they've done it but they've definitely ruined it. It's all been cordoned off so people can't get in there, but it looks like someone had climbed over - maybe it was someone throwing paint over it to ruin it just because they can, it's difficult to say.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">Tim Clarke for dailymail.co.uk</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/10/82588355-0-image-a-14_1710931385364.jpg" /><figcaption>Islington Council said on Tuesday: 'Culture is a powerful way to tell meaningful stories and we welcome this artwork in Islington, a borough that celebrates creativity. This fantastic piece from Banksy has sparked a real buzz across Islington and beyond, and we very much want the artwork to stay for people to enjoy. We want to find more ways that we can tell important stories through art and culture.' MailOnline has approached the authority for comment on the latest developments. Banksy, who has 12.3million Instagram followers, confirms art is his by posting a picture - and provided this for the Finsbury Park painting at 11.13am on Monday. Prior to the official announcement, the artwork had already been gathering fans at the site on Hornsey Road in north London.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Ella Nunn/PA Wire</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/10/82594077-0-image-a-15_1710931398253.jpg" /><figcaption>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (pictured) said he was 'delighted' to see the artwork in his Islington North constituency. The MP, now sitting in Parliament as an independent, said: 'Banksy's come to Finsbury Park with a bit of greenery in a place that needs a bit more greenery. We're the most densely populated constituency in the country and I'm just delighted. It gives the idea that we could do with much more greenery everywhere and I think that's a really nice message.' Apartment block resident Amy earlier told MailOnline that her housemates and their boyfriends were none the wiser when the green paint was splattered.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Jonathan Brady/PA Wire</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/10/82676153-0-image-a-16_1710931415002.jpg" /><figcaption>She said: 'Our landlord has the whole building and we had a bit of banter with him about it last night and he said, "Don't worry, it's fine". I think it's great for community. This road is a bit of a weird in-between area between Archway and Finsbury Park. It's like it's been fun to be part of our building and it's so nice to see how many people are here.' Estate agent Alex Georgiou, who bought the property in 2012 for £400,000 ($500k) according to land registry records, looked to allay neighbours' fears by claiming he wouldn't be charging more off the back of the area's sudden fame. However, he welcomed interest from potential buyers, as he bullishly told MailOnline: 'You know what, if somebody offered me millions and they can have the building and take the flats with it.

The council's tree service had been maintaining it for some time to help prolong its lifespan and is attempting to keep the decaying tree alive. The last time Banksy's art was revealed in London, it ended in scandal. Two men were arrested and bailed for allegedly using bolt cutters to steal the artwork which pictured a stop sign featuring three military drones.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Ella Nunn/PA Wire</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/10/82676143-13218317-image-a-18_1710931850221.jpg" /><figcaption>Once Banksy announced on social media the artwork belonged to him in an Instagram post shortly after midday on December 23, two men allegedly appeared at the scene and cut down the artwork before running off. Police have yet to recover the piece of art, but one gallery owner told the BBC at the time it could be worth up to £500,000 ($630k).</figcaption><span class="copyright">Tim Clarke for dailymail.co.uk</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/10/82676821-0-Want_more_stories_like_this_from_the_Daily_Mail_Visit_our_profil-a-1_1710931164690.jpg" /><figcaption>Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Macron's cringe-worthy portrayal of strength with the boxing photos resemble similar attempts by Russian president Putin, whose office previously released photos of him beating an opponent in Judo, playing ice hockey or riding shirtless on a horse.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Soazig de la Moissonnie¿re/Pre¿sidence de la Re¿publique</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82487895-0-image-a-27_1711006369179.jpg" /><figcaption>The pictures come amid repeated warnings by Macron, who said sending Western ground troops into Ukraine should not be 'ruled out' and urged European leaders not to be 'cowards' when it comes to the defence of Ukraine. His comments on ground troops - a break from other NATO countries - caused alarm among Ukraine's western backers, who have long viewed sending troops into the country currently besieged by Russia as a red line that must not be crossed.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Eric Tschaen- Pool/SIPA/Shutters</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82484481-0-image-a-28_1711006378783.jpg" /><figcaption>What was meant to be a galvanising call from Macron to bolster support for Kyiv has instead driven a wedge between the EU's two largest powers - France and Germany - with Berlin promptly affirming it would not be sending its troops to Ukraine. Other key players in the European sphere of influence, including NATO members Britain and Poland , have also been quick to stamp out Macron's suggestion.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Abdullah Firas/ABACA/Shutterstoc</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82506895-0-image-a-29_1711006389830.jpg" /><figcaption>Some welcomed the 'strategic ambiguity' of his remarks - the importance of never announcing your intentions to an adversary. But Macron's comments also prompted fierce rebuke from Vladimir Putin, who quickly threatened 'weapons exist in order to use them' in an interview on Russian state TV in reference to the possibility of deploying nukes should Western troops be deployed in Ukraine. Macron chastised Putin for threatening the use of nuclear devices and reminded him France also has an advanced weapons programme in interviews with French media last week.</figcaption><span class="copyright">POOL/AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82487889-0-image-a-30_1711006399434.jpg" /><figcaption>He also declared his nation 'ready' to use nuclear weapons in an uncharacteristically brash retort to Vladimir Putin following the latest bout of nuclear sabre-rattling from the Kremlin chief. 'We must first and foremost feel protected because we are a nuclear power. We are ready; we have a doctrine (for the use of nuclear weapons),' Macron told reporters, saying the Kremlin's willingness to issue nuclear threats was inappropriate. Having nuclear weapons 'imposes on us the responsibility never to escalate,' Macron said, in a dig at the constant reminders issued by top Russian officials and media personalities of their nuclear arsenal.</figcaption><span class="copyright">EPA </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/81831531-0-image-a-31_1711006407753.jpg" /><figcaption>In some of his latest comments about the war, Macron said last week that a Russian victory in Ukraine 'would reduce Europe's credibility to zero' as he again refused to rule out deploying troops. The French leader spoke on French TV about how to further support Ukraine and the interview was aimed at clarifying his policy that the sending of ground forces was not on the agenda now, but Europe must keep 'all options' open in case the war spread. He said that responsibility for prompting such a move would lie with Moscow as France would not lead an offensive into Ukraine. He said: 'It wouldn't be us,' but later added: 'To have peace in Ukraine, we must not be weak.' 'If Russia wins this war, Europe's credibility will be reduced to zero,' Macron told French broadcasters TF1 and France 2 television.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Anadolu via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/81831231-13222205-image-a-32_1711006651611.jpg" /><figcaption>He also said that the continent's security was 'at stake' in the conflict which he said is 'existential for our Europe and for France'. Macron later added in a video on social media that Moldova, Romania and Poland could be under immediate threat if Ukraine lost the war. Calling the conflict in Ukraine 'existential for our Europe and for France', Macron said anybody advocating 'limits' on aid to Ukraine 'chooses defeat'. He said there had been 'too many limits in our vocabulary' since the Russian invasion in February 2022. 'Two years ago we said we would never send tanks. We did. Two years ago, we said we would never send medium-range missiles. We did,' he said. 'Those who say 'let's not support Ukraine' do not make the choice of peace, they make the choice of defeat,' Macron added.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Anadolu via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82400289-13222205-image-a-33_1711006674365.jpg" /><figcaption>His statements come amid a hardening of Paris' stance towards Moscow after Macron abandoned his longstanding efforts to maintain a closer bond with Putin. Britain and France are Europe's only nuclear powers, but even their collective power is a fraction of that employed by Russia, which has the world's largest and most varied collection of nuclear weapons by some margin - even larger than that in Washington's vast stockpiles. Macron openly acknowledges his position has now undergone a major turnaround, citing a 'hardening' in Russia's stance at home and abroad, which has seen the prison death of opposition figure Alexei Navalny that supporters have blamed on the Kremlin, as well as a flurry of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against countries including France.</figcaption><span class="copyright">EPA </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82701397-13222205-image-a-34_1711006687321.jpg" /><figcaption>He has repeated as a mantra that 'Russia cannot win this war' and shocked European allies in February by refusing to rule out the sending of Western ground troops. 'Who would think for a single second that President Putin, who did not respect any of his limits and engagements, would stop there?' he said in an interview with French television on Thursday, insisting there should be 'no limits' in support for Ukraine and describing the war as 'existential' for Ukraine and Europe. Macron met German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has expressed discomfort with France's more bellicose stance, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk for talks in Berlin last Friday. 'If Russia wins the life of the French will change. We will have no more security in Europe,' Macron warned.</figcaption><span class="copyright">RIA NOVOSTI/AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82642711-13222205-image-a-35_1711006705120.jpg" /><figcaption>This comes ahead of a meeting by European leaders in Brussels tomorrow, where the representatives of the 27-nation bloc will discuss the war in Ukraine. 'Into the third year of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, we face a pivotal moment. Urgency, intensity and unwavering determination are imperative,' EU Council President Charles Michel wrote in a letter inviting presidents and prime ministers to the two-day summit in Brussels. 'The swift provision of military aid to Ukraine' is top priority,' Michel wrote. The other, to shore up Europe's defenses. 'Now that we are facing the biggest security threat since the Second World War, it is high time we take radical and concrete steps to be defense-ready and put the EU's economy on a `war footing',' he said.</figcaption><span class="copyright">EPA </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82592337-13222205-image-a-36_1711006722225.jpg" /><figcaption>It's unlikely that all 27 leaders would accept the shift to a war economy that might help produce the weapons and ammunition needed. Hungary for one, Russia's closest ally inside the EU, is suing for peace and refuses to arm Ukraine. Still, the realization that Russia under Putin would pose an existential threat should Ukraine fall has galvanized most of Europe. 'If the Russian president thinks he just has to sit out this war and we will weaken in our support, then he has miscalculated,' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Wednesday. 'Russia is not strong, and it cannot speculate on us letting off in our support. We will continue it for as long as necessary.' Support is growing among some leaders for defence bonds to finance military spending through common debt issuance; the same way the EU raised money for its pandemic recovery fund.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Cover Video</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/61684721-13222205-Want_more_stories_like_this_from_the_Daily_Mail_Hit_the_follow_b-a-37_1711006733102.jpg" /><figcaption>Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

To the financial strain. We been through it all! She said of her daughters: 'The girls are too young to understand, yet they noticed the changes. They would often ask, "When is mommy coming home?" Or "How come mommy keeps going in the ambulance truck?" Being wheeled into the ambulance and waving bye to my kids, only to see them crying for their mommy to stay home, broke me. And watching my husband break down in tears, was rough.' She added of her spouse: 'I gotta say, this was the toughest storm I have ever been through.

'Just the other day this defeated looking man came up to me and said: 'Mr. President I need your help. I'm in crushing debt. I'm completely wiped out,' Biden joked. His punchline: 'Donald, I'm sorry. I can't help you.' The crowd roared. Isn't it hysterical when the legal system targets your opponent?In February, a state Supreme Court ordered Trump to pay the giant penalty after he and the Trump organization were found to have falsified financial statements, and misled banks and insurance companies. 'I can't wait to see the chains on Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. I'm kind of excited about it,' squealed 'The View's' Sunny Hostin. How foolish. What these unhinged Leftists don't understand - and never will - is that they are shooting themselves in the foot. Nothing's better for Republican unity than Democratic lunacy. If anything will convince stubborn Never-Trumpers to overcome their misgivings and vote for the ex-president this November, it's this brazen, extra-legal, nation-destroying madness.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Josh Hammer For Dailymail.Com</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2024-03-21T14:08:09.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle><![CDATA[HAMMER: $454M ruling against Trump will end up costing Biden dearly]]></mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2024-03-21T14:08:09.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Christmas,Democrats,Donald Trump,Joe Biden,The View,US Supreme Court,Whoopi Goldberg</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/13/82728665-0-image-a-19_1711028014158.jpg" medium="image"><media:title><![CDATA[MailOnline logo]]></media:title><media:text><![CDATA[MailOnline logo]]></media:text><mi:hasSyndicationRights>1</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>3435391</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Brian Cahn/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutt / The View / YouTube</mi:licensorName></media:content></item><item><title>Now Tory candidate for Manchester Mayor defects to Reform UK... as shock poll shows Nigel Farage-backed insurgents just FOUR POINTS behind Rishi Sunak's party and closing</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13223223/Tory-candidate-Manchester-Mayor-defects-Reform-Nigel-Farage-Rishi-Sunak-election.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 12:37:24 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[Dan Barker declared that he is switching sides saying Reform UK is the 'new home of conservatism'.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">13223223-channel-news</guid><category>news</category><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="mol-para-with-font">The Tories' candidate for Manchester Mayor today defected to Reform UK in another body blow for <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/rishi-sunak/index.html">Rishi Sunak</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dan Barker declared that he is switching sides saying the insurgents are the 'new home of conservatism'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although Mr Barker was seen as having no chance of winning the contest on May 2, the move will send more shockwaves through the Tories after former deputy chairman Lee Anderson's shift in alliances</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It came hours after a poll showed Reform just four points behind the Conservatives, on 15 per cent after adding a point over the past week. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/conservatives/index.html">Conservatives</a> were down one on 19 per cent, with <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/labour/index.html">Labour</a> miles ahead on 44 per cent, according to the study for the Times.</p><div class="slideshow"><cite>Milo Pope</cite><title>Dozens of illegal migrants rescued crossing the English Channel</title><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/01/82629819-13216783-Dozens_of_illegal_migrants_have_been_rescued_after_trying_to_cro-a-13_1710898314657.jpg" /><figcaption>Dozens of illegal migrants have been rescued after trying to cross the English Channel to reach the UK.

Macron's cringe-worthy portrayal of strength with the boxing photos resemble similar attempts by Russian president Putin, whose office previously released photos of him beating an opponent in Judo, playing ice hockey or riding shirtless on a horse.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Soazig de la Moissonnie¿re/Pre¿sidence de la Re¿publique</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82487895-0-image-a-27_1711006369179.jpg" /><figcaption>The pictures come amid repeated warnings by Macron, who said sending Western ground troops into Ukraine should not be 'ruled out' and urged European leaders not to be 'cowards' when it comes to the defence of Ukraine. His comments on ground troops - a break from other NATO countries - caused alarm among Ukraine's western backers, who have long viewed sending troops into the country currently besieged by Russia as a red line that must not be crossed.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Eric Tschaen- Pool/SIPA/Shutters</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82484481-0-image-a-28_1711006378783.jpg" /><figcaption>What was meant to be a galvanising call from Macron to bolster support for Kyiv has instead driven a wedge between the EU's two largest powers - France and Germany - with Berlin promptly affirming it would not be sending its troops to Ukraine. Other key players in the European sphere of influence, including NATO members Britain and Poland , have also been quick to stamp out Macron's suggestion.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Abdullah Firas/ABACA/Shutterstoc</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82506895-0-image-a-29_1711006389830.jpg" /><figcaption>Some welcomed the 'strategic ambiguity' of his remarks - the importance of never announcing your intentions to an adversary. But Macron's comments also prompted fierce rebuke from Vladimir Putin, who quickly threatened 'weapons exist in order to use them' in an interview on Russian state TV in reference to the possibility of deploying nukes should Western troops be deployed in Ukraine. Macron chastised Putin for threatening the use of nuclear devices and reminded him France also has an advanced weapons programme in interviews with French media last week.</figcaption><span class="copyright">POOL/AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82487889-0-image-a-30_1711006399434.jpg" /><figcaption>He also declared his nation 'ready' to use nuclear weapons in an uncharacteristically brash retort to Vladimir Putin following the latest bout of nuclear sabre-rattling from the Kremlin chief. 'We must first and foremost feel protected because we are a nuclear power. We are ready; we have a doctrine (for the use of nuclear weapons),' Macron told reporters, saying the Kremlin's willingness to issue nuclear threats was inappropriate. Having nuclear weapons 'imposes on us the responsibility never to escalate,' Macron said, in a dig at the constant reminders issued by top Russian officials and media personalities of their nuclear arsenal.</figcaption><span class="copyright">EPA </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/81831531-0-image-a-31_1711006407753.jpg" /><figcaption>In some of his latest comments about the war, Macron said last week that a Russian victory in Ukraine 'would reduce Europe's credibility to zero' as he again refused to rule out deploying troops. The French leader spoke on French TV about how to further support Ukraine and the interview was aimed at clarifying his policy that the sending of ground forces was not on the agenda now, but Europe must keep 'all options' open in case the war spread. He said that responsibility for prompting such a move would lie with Moscow as France would not lead an offensive into Ukraine. He said: 'It wouldn't be us,' but later added: 'To have peace in Ukraine, we must not be weak.' 'If Russia wins this war, Europe's credibility will be reduced to zero,' Macron told French broadcasters TF1 and France 2 television.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Anadolu via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/81831231-13222205-image-a-32_1711006651611.jpg" /><figcaption>He also said that the continent's security was 'at stake' in the conflict which he said is 'existential for our Europe and for France'. Macron later added in a video on social media that Moldova, Romania and Poland could be under immediate threat if Ukraine lost the war. Calling the conflict in Ukraine 'existential for our Europe and for France', Macron said anybody advocating 'limits' on aid to Ukraine 'chooses defeat'. He said there had been 'too many limits in our vocabulary' since the Russian invasion in February 2022. 'Two years ago we said we would never send tanks. We did. Two years ago, we said we would never send medium-range missiles. We did,' he said. 'Those who say 'let's not support Ukraine' do not make the choice of peace, they make the choice of defeat,' Macron added.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Anadolu via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82400289-13222205-image-a-33_1711006674365.jpg" /><figcaption>His statements come amid a hardening of Paris' stance towards Moscow after Macron abandoned his longstanding efforts to maintain a closer bond with Putin. Britain and France are Europe's only nuclear powers, but even their collective power is a fraction of that employed by Russia, which has the world's largest and most varied collection of nuclear weapons by some margin - even larger than that in Washington's vast stockpiles. Macron openly acknowledges his position has now undergone a major turnaround, citing a 'hardening' in Russia's stance at home and abroad, which has seen the prison death of opposition figure Alexei Navalny that supporters have blamed on the Kremlin, as well as a flurry of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against countries including France.</figcaption><span class="copyright">EPA </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82701397-13222205-image-a-34_1711006687321.jpg" /><figcaption>He has repeated as a mantra that 'Russia cannot win this war' and shocked European allies in February by refusing to rule out the sending of Western ground troops. 'Who would think for a single second that President Putin, who did not respect any of his limits and engagements, would stop there?' he said in an interview with French television on Thursday, insisting there should be 'no limits' in support for Ukraine and describing the war as 'existential' for Ukraine and Europe. Macron met German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has expressed discomfort with France's more bellicose stance, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk for talks in Berlin last Friday. 'If Russia wins the life of the French will change. We will have no more security in Europe,' Macron warned.</figcaption><span class="copyright">RIA NOVOSTI/AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82642711-13222205-image-a-35_1711006705120.jpg" /><figcaption>This comes ahead of a meeting by European leaders in Brussels tomorrow, where the representatives of the 27-nation bloc will discuss the war in Ukraine. 'Into the third year of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, we face a pivotal moment. Urgency, intensity and unwavering determination are imperative,' EU Council President Charles Michel wrote in a letter inviting presidents and prime ministers to the two-day summit in Brussels. 'The swift provision of military aid to Ukraine' is top priority,' Michel wrote. The other, to shore up Europe's defenses. 'Now that we are facing the biggest security threat since the Second World War, it is high time we take radical and concrete steps to be defense-ready and put the EU's economy on a `war footing',' he said.</figcaption><span class="copyright">EPA </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82592337-13222205-image-a-36_1711006722225.jpg" /><figcaption>It's unlikely that all 27 leaders would accept the shift to a war economy that might help produce the weapons and ammunition needed. Hungary for one, Russia's closest ally inside the EU, is suing for peace and refuses to arm Ukraine. Still, the realization that Russia under Putin would pose an existential threat should Ukraine fall has galvanized most of Europe. 'If the Russian president thinks he just has to sit out this war and we will weaken in our support, then he has miscalculated,' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Wednesday. 'Russia is not strong, and it cannot speculate on us letting off in our support. We will continue it for as long as necessary.' Support is growing among some leaders for defence bonds to finance military spending through common debt issuance; the same way the EU raised money for its pandemic recovery fund.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Cover Video</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/61684721-13222205-Want_more_stories_like_this_from_the_Daily_Mail_Hit_the_follow_b-a-37_1711006733102.jpg" /><figcaption>Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The storm, named by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, became a 'weather bomb' this morning as its central pressure falls by up to 50 millibars over 24 hours.

The gelatinous, transparent masses have been found along the coasts of northern California and Oregon, and sometimes as far as Alaska, but typically live in warm seas - and at great depths. Now, scientists at Oregon State University found these pyrosomes or ¿sea pickles¿ are appearing in droves due to a major marine heatwave that started in 2013 - marking the first time the animals have been seen in 25 years.</figcaption><span class="copyright">University of Oregon</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/19/18/82645357-13215599-Since_the_proliferation_of_pyrosomes_in_the_Pacific_Ocean_they_h-a-26_1710871519136.jpg" /><figcaption>Since the proliferation of pyrosomes in the Pacific Ocean, they have also consumed the majority of energy in the sea, causing the number of salmon and seabirds to decline.

Pyrosomes are colonies of thousands of animals called zooids that form in a hollow tube that can grow large enough for a human to fit through. The marine animals have a gene called luciferase which produces light and when it reacts with the a luminescent chemical, it sends the light up and down the tube, allowing it to see several yards in front of it.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Alamy Stock Photo</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/19/18/82645353-13215599-They_can_also_reproduce_through_asexual_reproduction_by_effectiv-a-32_1710871519253.jpg" /><figcaption>They can also reproduce through asexual reproduction - by effectively cloning themselves - or they can reproduce with a sexual partner. The researchers looked at data across 80 groups of creatures, three nutrient pools, five detritus pools and two fisheries collected since 2014. ¿Pyrosomes consume animals at the base of the food web and lock up that energy,¿ said Lisa Crozier, a research scientist at NOAA Fisheries Northwest Fisheries Science Center and co-author of the paper.</figcaption><span class="copyright">NOAA Fisheries</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/19/18/82645341-13215599-_They_re_taking_energy_out_of_the_system_that_predators_need_she-a-34_1710871519261.jpg" /><figcaption>¿They¿re taking energy out of the system that predators need,¿ she added. According to the study, pyrosomes have long been considered ¿trophic dead ends¿ because they can¿t serve as an energy source for other species and how nutritious they are for other creatures that have consumed them in recent years remains unclear. ¿That has an impact on the entire ecosystem ¿ the pyrosome is consuming energy that normally would have gone through multiple preys to eventually end up in a salmon,¿ co-author of the study Dylan Gomes told The Seattle Times.</figcaption><span class="copyright">@rob_suryan / Twitter</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/19/18/82645355-13215599-Pyrosomes_are_not_consumed_as_frequently_as_other_creatures_like-a-33_1710871519254.jpg" /><figcaption>Pyrosomes are not consumed as frequently as other creatures, like jellyfish, and the study suggests it ¿may be because they are more difficult to digest, offer lower energy content, or remain novel to the food web such that predators have not yet responded.¿ The 2013 marine heatwave, dubbed ¿the Blob¿ increased the water temperatures, allowing pyrosomes to thrive while some fisheries closed because salmon, cod and Dungeness crabs declined.

Hamas insists an agreement should end the war. Egypt is also seeking to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, increase entry of aid, and allow for the displaced in the south of the enclave to move to the north, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said. Sisi, speaking in a recorded message, also warned against the danger of an Israeli incursion into the border city of Rafah.

On Friday, Robert Arthur Plympton (pictured left), 60, was found guilty of murdering Barbara May Tucker (pictured right) the night of January 15, 1980, as she walked across the Mount Hood Community College campus. Suspicions were raised when she never arrived at class. The following morning, students discovered her cold, partially naked body near a campus parking lot. There were signs she been sexually assaulted and had fought against her assailant. A medical examiner determined the teen had been [sexually assaulted] and beaten to death.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Multnomah County Sheriff's Office / KATU / Provided</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/14/82483875-13219203-image-a-21_1710945582611.jpg" /><figcaption>Friday's ruling came after a three-week bench trial in Portland. According to The Oregonian, Tucker's case was the oldest cold-case murder in the city of Gresham. Decades passed before investigators were able to identify a suspect and make an arrest.

Detectives with the Gresham Police Department learned that Plympton was living in Troutdale and began monitoring him. When Plympton spat a piece of chewing gum onto the ground, they collected it and submitted it to a state police crime lab. 'The lab determined the DNA profile developed from the chewing gum matched the DNA profile developed from Ms. Tucker¿s vaginal swabs,' the district attorney¿s office said.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Multnomah County Sheriff's Office</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/14/82684129-0-image-a-16_1710945227814.jpg" /><figcaption>This method of DNA collection is similar to a step taken in the case of accused serial killer Rex Heuermann, where investigators matched DNA on a discarded pizza crust with evidence from the burlap used to bind one of the Gilgo Beach murder victims. Plympton was just 16 when Tucker was assaulted and beaten to death. Witnesses reported seeing her with a man the night of her murder, and several people recalled seeing her run into the street waving her arms, possibly trying to flag down help. Plympton was arrested on June 8, 2021, as he drove away from the home he shared with his wife and son. He pleaded not guilty to the murder charges at his arraignment that month. There was no evidence that Plympton and Tucker had known each other, Multnomah County Chief Deputy District Attorney Kirsten Snowden said at trial.</figcaption><span class="copyright">katu</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/14/82684131-0-image-a-17_1710945239340.jpg" /><figcaption>Judge Amy Baggio of Multnomah County Circuit Court found the 60-year-old guilty of one count of first-degree murder and four counts of 'different theories of murder in the second degree,' the district attorney's office said. 'To be clear, this court has zero doubt whatsoever that Robert Plympton beat Barbara Tucker in her head and face until she died,' Baggio said in court. 'He did.' Plympton was charged with [sexual assault] and [sexual intercourse] abuse in addition to the counts of first- and second-degree murder. Despite evidence that Tucker had been sexually assaulted, Plympton was not convicted on these charges, as prosecutors failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the abuse happened while she was alive. During the trial, Plympton maintained his innocence, claiming he did not match the description of a man seen pulling the victim into the bushes.</figcaption><span class="copyright">katu</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/14/82684133-0-image-a-18_1710945265523.jpg" /><figcaption>Defense attorney Stephen Houze said there was 'unmistakable, unavoidable reasonable doubt' about who killed Tucker. He pointed to witnesses' descriptions of the man who was seen with Tucker - who was nearly six feet tall - as being about her height or taller. Plympton's booking records list his height as 5'9. Houze also asserted that investigators never tested Tucker¿s clothing for DNA evidence. In a statement Tuesday, Plympton's lawyers vowed to appeal the ruling, stating they were 'confident that his convictions will be overturned.' Two of Tucker's relatives cried and embraced after the verdict was read. Her older sister, Alice Juan, said in a statement to The New York Times that her family was 'thrilled that this was finally solved.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">katu</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/14/82684135-0-image-a-19_1710945278578.jpg" /><figcaption>'I thought it might not be as the years went on, but Barbie was a special little girl,' she said, describing Tucker as 'bright, bubbly, caring, all of those things.' At the time of Plympton's arrest in 2021, Susan Pater (pictured right),  one of Tucker¿s three sisters, told KATU News that detectives had promised to hunt down the killer. 'I was just totally taken aback. It was amazing,' Pater said. 'It was really good news. I¿d given up. Although I think of her almost every night.' She said she was struggling to come to terms with the fact that her sister's murderer had been living close by for so long.</figcaption><span class="copyright">katu</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/14/82683885-0-image-a-20_1710945304451.jpg" /><figcaption>'That somehow it didn¿t slip, or come out of his mouth, that somebody might have done something, that he was able to carry on with his life after taking another. Yeah, it¿s very hard,' she said. 'Could he sleep at night? I have a feeling he probably could.' Plympton remains in custody at the Multnomah County Detention Center. He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 21 and faces a life sentence with the possibility of parole after 30 years on the first-degree murder charge.</figcaption><span class="copyright">None</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/14/82686725-0-Want_more_stories_like_this_from_the_Daily_Mail_Visit_our_profil-a-1_1710945155096.jpg" /><figcaption>Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

To date, the DWP has not acknowledged failings or put things right for those affected - although Cabinet minister Mel Stride is expected to make a statement to the Commons next week.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>James Tapsfield, Political Editor For Mailonline</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2024-03-21T14:11:35.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle><![CDATA[Demands for huge payout to 'WASPI' women after report]]></mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2024-03-21T14:11:35.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Downing Street,Mel Stride</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/12/82728243-0-image-a-20_1711023638061.jpg" medium="image"><media:title><![CDATA[MailOnline logo]]></media:title><media:text><![CDATA[MailOnline logo]]></media:text><mi:hasSyndicationRights>1</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1146016</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>PA</mi:licensorName></media:content></item><item><title>Fears over Rwanda delays as ministers put showdown with House of Lords on ice until April 15 after unelected peers defeated government on crucial amendments</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13222855/Rwanda-delays-ministers-House-Lords-April-Easter-deported-migrants-Channel.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 11:01:43 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[The Spring timetable for the first Rwanda deportation flights is at risk with Penny Mordaunt confirming that MPs will not consider legislation until April 15.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">13222855-channel-news</guid><category>news</category><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="mol-para-with-font">Fears over delays to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/rishi-sunak/index.html">Rishi Sunak</a>'s <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/rwanda/index.html">Rwanda</a> plan were fuelled today as ministers kicked a showdown with the House of Lords until after <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/easter/index.html">Easter</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The PM's timetable of the first deportation flights taking off in the Spring looks increasingly difficult, with Commons Leader <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/penny-mordaunt/index.html">Penny Mordaunt</a> confirming that MPs will not consider legislation until April 15.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unelected peers again pressed their demands for revisions to the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill last night, including overturning the move to oust the courts from the process.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Lords defied plead from ministers to bow to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/the-view/index.html">the view</a> of MPs, who earlier in the week reversed a raft of changes proposed by the Lords.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ms Mordaunt suggested that if MPs remove the amendments on April 15 and peers subsequently reinstate them, there will be a final showdown on April 17.  </p><div class="slideshow"><cite>Miriam Kuepper</cite><title>French president poses for cringe-worthy black and white boxing photos</title><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82697257-0-image-m-25_1711006310080.jpg" /><figcaption>French president Emmanuel Macron (pictured) has posed for cringe-worthy black and white boxing photos as he tries to position himself as the strongman of Europe standing up to Putin. The pictures were released by Macron's official photographer Sazig de la Moissonniere and show the French leader in a boxing gym yesterday, where he flexed his muscles as he hit a punching bag.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Soazig de la Moissonnie¿re/Pre¿sidence de la Re¿publique</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82697255-0-image-a-26_1711006350669.jpg" /><figcaption>His face set in a determined grimace, Macron aimed to show off his fighting spirit and determination after military experts said he is bidding to lead NATO as a 'Napoleon'. Macron's cringe-worthy portrayal of strength with the boxing photos resemble similar attempts by Russian president Putin, whose office previously released photos of him beating an opponent in Judo, playing ice hockey or riding shirtless on a horse.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Soazig de la Moissonnie¿re/Pre¿sidence de la Re¿publique</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82487895-0-image-a-27_1711006369179.jpg" /><figcaption>The pictures come amid repeated warnings by Macron, who said sending Western ground troops into Ukraine should not be 'ruled out' and urged European leaders not to be 'cowards' when it comes to the defence of Ukraine. His comments on ground troops - a break from other NATO countries - caused alarm among Ukraine's western backers, who have long viewed sending troops into the country currently besieged by Russia as a red line that must not be crossed.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Eric Tschaen- Pool/SIPA/Shutters</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82484481-0-image-a-28_1711006378783.jpg" /><figcaption>What was meant to be a galvanising call from Macron to bolster support for Kyiv has instead driven a wedge between the EU's two largest powers - France and Germany - with Berlin promptly affirming it would not be sending its troops to Ukraine. Other key players in the European sphere of influence, including NATO members Britain and Poland , have also been quick to stamp out Macron's suggestion.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Abdullah Firas/ABACA/Shutterstoc</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82506895-0-image-a-29_1711006389830.jpg" /><figcaption>Some welcomed the 'strategic ambiguity' of his remarks - the importance of never announcing your intentions to an adversary. But Macron's comments also prompted fierce rebuke from Vladimir Putin, who quickly threatened 'weapons exist in order to use them' in an interview on Russian state TV in reference to the possibility of deploying nukes should Western troops be deployed in Ukraine. Macron chastised Putin for threatening the use of nuclear devices and reminded him France also has an advanced weapons programme in interviews with French media last week.</figcaption><span class="copyright">POOL/AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82487889-0-image-a-30_1711006399434.jpg" /><figcaption>He also declared his nation 'ready' to use nuclear weapons in an uncharacteristically brash retort to Vladimir Putin following the latest bout of nuclear sabre-rattling from the Kremlin chief. 'We must first and foremost feel protected because we are a nuclear power. We are ready; we have a doctrine (for the use of nuclear weapons),' Macron told reporters, saying the Kremlin's willingness to issue nuclear threats was inappropriate. Having nuclear weapons 'imposes on us the responsibility never to escalate,' Macron said, in a dig at the constant reminders issued by top Russian officials and media personalities of their nuclear arsenal.</figcaption><span class="copyright">EPA </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/81831531-0-image-a-31_1711006407753.jpg" /><figcaption>In some of his latest comments about the war, Macron said last week that a Russian victory in Ukraine 'would reduce Europe's credibility to zero' as he again refused to rule out deploying troops. The French leader spoke on French TV about how to further support Ukraine and the interview was aimed at clarifying his policy that the sending of ground forces was not on the agenda now, but Europe must keep 'all options' open in case the war spread. He said that responsibility for prompting such a move would lie with Moscow as France would not lead an offensive into Ukraine. He said: 'It wouldn't be us,' but later added: 'To have peace in Ukraine, we must not be weak.' 'If Russia wins this war, Europe's credibility will be reduced to zero,' Macron told French broadcasters TF1 and France 2 television.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Anadolu via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/81831231-13222205-image-a-32_1711006651611.jpg" /><figcaption>He also said that the continent's security was 'at stake' in the conflict which he said is 'existential for our Europe and for France'. Macron later added in a video on social media that Moldova, Romania and Poland could be under immediate threat if Ukraine lost the war. Calling the conflict in Ukraine 'existential for our Europe and for France', Macron said anybody advocating 'limits' on aid to Ukraine 'chooses defeat'. He said there had been 'too many limits in our vocabulary' since the Russian invasion in February 2022. 'Two years ago we said we would never send tanks. We did. Two years ago, we said we would never send medium-range missiles. We did,' he said. 'Those who say 'let's not support Ukraine' do not make the choice of peace, they make the choice of defeat,' Macron added.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Anadolu via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82400289-13222205-image-a-33_1711006674365.jpg" /><figcaption>His statements come amid a hardening of Paris' stance towards Moscow after Macron abandoned his longstanding efforts to maintain a closer bond with Putin. Britain and France are Europe's only nuclear powers, but even their collective power is a fraction of that employed by Russia, which has the world's largest and most varied collection of nuclear weapons by some margin - even larger than that in Washington's vast stockpiles. Macron openly acknowledges his position has now undergone a major turnaround, citing a 'hardening' in Russia's stance at home and abroad, which has seen the prison death of opposition figure Alexei Navalny that supporters have blamed on the Kremlin, as well as a flurry of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against countries including France.</figcaption><span class="copyright">EPA </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82701397-13222205-image-a-34_1711006687321.jpg" /><figcaption>He has repeated as a mantra that 'Russia cannot win this war' and shocked European allies in February by refusing to rule out the sending of Western ground troops. 'Who would think for a single second that President Putin, who did not respect any of his limits and engagements, would stop there?' he said in an interview with French television on Thursday, insisting there should be 'no limits' in support for Ukraine and describing the war as 'existential' for Ukraine and Europe. Macron met German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has expressed discomfort with France's more bellicose stance, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk for talks in Berlin last Friday. 'If Russia wins the life of the French will change. We will have no more security in Europe,' Macron warned.</figcaption><span class="copyright">RIA NOVOSTI/AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82642711-13222205-image-a-35_1711006705120.jpg" /><figcaption>This comes ahead of a meeting by European leaders in Brussels tomorrow, where the representatives of the 27-nation bloc will discuss the war in Ukraine. 'Into the third year of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, we face a pivotal moment. Urgency, intensity and unwavering determination are imperative,' EU Council President Charles Michel wrote in a letter inviting presidents and prime ministers to the two-day summit in Brussels. 'The swift provision of military aid to Ukraine' is top priority,' Michel wrote. The other, to shore up Europe's defenses. 'Now that we are facing the biggest security threat since the Second World War, it is high time we take radical and concrete steps to be defense-ready and put the EU's economy on a `war footing',' he said.</figcaption><span class="copyright">EPA </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82592337-13222205-image-a-36_1711006722225.jpg" /><figcaption>It's unlikely that all 27 leaders would accept the shift to a war economy that might help produce the weapons and ammunition needed. Hungary for one, Russia's closest ally inside the EU, is suing for peace and refuses to arm Ukraine. Still, the realization that Russia under Putin would pose an existential threat should Ukraine fall has galvanized most of Europe. 'If the Russian president thinks he just has to sit out this war and we will weaken in our support, then he has miscalculated,' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Wednesday. 'Russia is not strong, and it cannot speculate on us letting off in our support. We will continue it for as long as necessary.' Support is growing among some leaders for defence bonds to finance military spending through common debt issuance; the same way the EU raised money for its pandemic recovery fund.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Cover Video</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/61684721-13222205-Want_more_stories_like_this_from_the_Daily_Mail_Hit_the_follow_b-a-37_1711006733102.jpg" /><figcaption>Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

'It was the first mobile, multimedia, tactical deception unit in the history of warfare,' said Rick Beyer of the Ghost Army Legacy Project.

Nussenbaum, who went on to work as a package designer, said he was being absolutely honest with his family after the war when they asked him about his experiences and he told them 'I blew up tanks!' 'Most of our operations were done within 100 to 300 yards of the front line,' said Anderson Wilson, who passed away in 2020.

'It was classified, we couldn't talk about it. People would ask, 'What did you do?' and I'd say, 'Well, I'm with special troops,' Wilson told the Record Courier in 2013. 'They'd say, 'Oh, you played in a band?' 'Yeah, I played in a band'. 'I didn't have to go through a lot of explanation. It didn't bother me,' Wilson, who did know how to play the drums and played in one of the bands on the boat ride to England, said at the time.

FAA administrator Whitaker (pictured) made a visit to the Boeing facilities and claimed it has prioritized production over safety.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/19/19/82618833-13215803-He_was_asked_if_there_were_certain_protocols_that_were_not_met_i-a-28_1710876110185.jpg" /><figcaption>He was asked if there were certain protocols that were not met in the way the aircraft manufacturer approached airplane production and he said: 'Not what you would have expected if safety is the first priority.

'I am not happy with the problems of my competitor. They are not good for the industry a whole,' Faury said when asked about Boeing. 'We are in an industry where quality and safety is top priority,' he added. Boeing's share price has plunged by 11.6 percent over the last month while Airbus rose by 13.1 percent.</figcaption><span class="copyright">None</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/19/19/82597913-13215803-Yesterday_the_CEO_of_United_Airlines_Scott_Kirby_pictured_moved_-a-23_1710876110130.jpg" /><figcaption>Yesterday, the CEO of United Airlines Scott Kirby (pictured) moved to reassure customers that flying with the company is safe in an email circulated to subscribers. 'Safety is our highest priority and is at the center of everything we do,' Kirby said in an email to customers on Monday. 'Unfortunately, in the past few weeks, our airline has experienced a number of incidents that are reminders of the importance of safety.' The FAA is investigating the worrying incidents, which Kirby described as 'all unrelated' in the email.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/19/19/79920133-13215803-He_added_United_Airlines_is_reviewing_details_of_each_incident_a-a-30_1710876110201.jpg" /><figcaption>He added United Airlines is reviewing details of each incident 'and using those insights to inform our safety training and procedures across all employee groups.' The aviation industry came under the microscope over the string of recent mishaps, beginning with a door blowing off an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 on January 5. Just last week, a United Airlines Boeing 737-824 from San Francisco was grounded after it was found to be missing a panel when it touched down at Medford Airport in Oregon.</figcaption><span class="copyright">AP</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/19/19/82531535-13215803-Jackson_County_Airport_Director_Amber_Judd_said_the_panel_fell_o-a-31_1710876110203.jpg" /><figcaption>Jackson County Airport Director Amber Judd said the panel fell off the 25-year-old plane mid-flight, and that no injuries were reported by passengers or crew. While three days before, a Boeing jet was forced to land due to hydraulic fluid spewing from its landing gear area. It was also a United Airlines Flight. Also under investigation, the forced landing happened as the San Francisco-bound 777-300 embarked from Sydney, with fluid filmed leaking from its undercarriage. Boeing is now instructing airlines to inspect switches on pilots' seats in its flagship 787 Dreamliner jets - after a published report said an accidental cockpit seat movement likely caused the sudden plunge of a LATAM Airlines plane earlier this week.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Jackson County Airport Authority</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/19/19/82511649-13215803-It_said_it_recommended_airlines_inspect_the_motorized_cockpit_se-a-24_1710876110134.jpg" /><figcaption>It said it recommended airlines inspect the motorized cockpit seats the next time they perform maintenance. The aircraft manufacturer went on to point to instructions that include how to disable motors that move the seats in its 787s, before billing the advisory as no more than a 'precautionary measure.' It also comes less than a week after a former Boeing staffer was found dead by an apparent [self-murder] while doing depositions for a suit he filed against the firm alleging he witnessed second-rate parts being fitted on planes. The FAA has since revealed the firm failed 33 of 89 audits during an exam of Boeing's 737 Max - a model it had been planning to update with the long-delayed Max 10.</figcaption><span class="copyright">AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/19/19/82554239-13215803-After_the_incident_and_the_several_before_United_Airlines_reques-a-25_1710876110164.jpg" /><figcaption>After the incident - and the several before - United Airlines requested the firm halt work on the unreleased jets: an apparent sign of carriers' diminishing faith. The Boeing whistleblower found dead, 62-year-old John Barnett (pictured), had given stark warnings over the aviation giant's 787 Dreamliner and 737 Max models specifically in an interview, just weeks before his death. In the midst of a deposition in a whistleblower lawsuit in Charleston related to the production of the 787 Dreamliner plane, Barnett was found with a 'self-inflicted' gunshot wound in the parking lot of a hotel in Charleston, South Carolina. The FAA is investigating nine incidents this month alone involving United planes. Whitaker's interview with host Holt airs tonight on NBC Nightly News at 6.30 pm ET.

Cherizier has claimed responsibility for the latest surge in attacks, and said his goal is to capture Haiti's police chief and government ministers and prevent Henry's return to the Caribbean nation. Barbecue's threats will have struck fear into the hearts of many Haitians, with his reputation for burning people alive - something he has long denied - preceding him.</figcaption><span class="copyright">REUTERS</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/04/16/82009875-0-image-a-32_1709570888935.jpg" /><figcaption>The former elite police officer is now the boss of a feared federation of gangs called the 'G-9 Family and Allies', formed around 2020 and thought to be better armed than the country's official police force. Cherizier describes his men as a 'revolutionary force' which aims to wipe out the bourgeoisie and improve conditions for the poor, but his reign of violence has seen mass killings in some of Haiti's most poverty-stricken areas. He was, at one point, shot in the chest, narrowly avoiding death, and surrounds himself with heavily-armed masked thugs for protection.</figcaption><span class="copyright">REUTERS</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/04/16/70341945-0-image-a-33_1709570987345.jpg" /><figcaption>Barbecue's men are armed with high-powered rifles and are said to have endless supplies of ammunition - 'cartridges by the bucket' as one officer described it. He is accused of ordering a series of bloody killings in recent years, and faces sanctions from the UN and the United States over 'threatening the police, security or stability of Haiti'. As violence once again surges in Haiti, Cherizier this week warned locals to keep children from going to school to 'avoid collateral damages' as he and his men seek to bring down the government. It all comes after President Moise, who Cherizier's G9 gang allegedly allied with, was assassinated in his mansion, a killing officially blamed on Colombian mercenaries, but which many suspect was ordered by his rivals.</figcaption><span class="copyright">AP</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/04/16/82009969-0-image-a-34_1709571013901.jpg" /><figcaption>Prime minister Henry (pictured) took over and there has been civil unrest in Haiti in ever since, with protests erupting over his repeated stalling of general elections, which haven't happened in almost a decade. Cherizier was accused of leading several massacres during Moïse's term as president, with the then-leader failing to put a stop to them. Many of G-9's attacks are thought to have been supported by state actors, including a 2018 attack in La Saline, a 2019 attack in Bel-Air, and a 2020 attack in Cité Soleil.</figcaption><span class="copyright">AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/04/16/70342319-0-image-a-35_1709571030800.jpg" /><figcaption>The government's powerlessness was again demonstrated in September 2022 when the G-9 blocked the entrance to the vital Varreux fuel terminal, which supplies most of the oil products in Haiti. November 2022 saw another attack by the G-9, this time on the Source-Matelas neighbourhood. The massacre in the shanty town of Source-Matelas was sparked by the public execution of a local man called Jephté who gang leaders accused of being a police informant. A horrific image was circulated on social media to intimidate others showing the victim seconds before his death, bound hand and foot inside a truck tyre, a petrol canister beside him.</figcaption><span class="copyright">AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/04/16/70341943-0-image-a-36_1709571113667.jpg" /><figcaption>In an interview, a 16-year-old girl told MailOnline how she was gang [sexually assualted] by three men whose mob marched her father and brother from their home to be murdered. The girl - named only as Anne for her safety - said the attack happened during a massacre on November 28, when gangs of men raided houses and [sexually assaulted] and murdered those hiding inside. Such attacks continued into 2023. Between February 28 and March 5, the community of Bel-Air in the capital saw armed clashes between the G-9 gang and the Bel-Air gang in which 148 people were killed or went missing. More violence in Cité Soleil earlier last April saw nearly 70 people killed.</figcaption><span class="copyright">AP</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/04/16/82001099-0-image-a-37_1709571123882.jpg" /><figcaption>Each attack saw gangs enter impoverished neighbourhoods in the capital and unleash death on the population. Despite his violent exploits, Cherizier cultivates a 'Robin Hood' image on social media - describing himself as a community leader who gives out cash when people are in need, clears garbage from the streets and protects people from rival gangs. He pitches himself as a freedom fighter for Haiti, and perhaps even its next leader. 'The people are in need of a leader and are seeking one,' Cherizier told Vice World News in 2021. 'I am talking about the misery of the poor people. I am talking about my country that doesn't have hospitals, professional schools, medical clinics. People are sleeping next to pigs.

'I would never massacre people in the same social class as me,' Cherizier declared. He told the AP he takes inspiration from late dictator Francois 'Papa Doc' Duvalier, who ruled Haiti with a bloody brutality as 'president for life' from 1957 to 1971.

'He performed an out patient biopsy on me,' Pettway said. 'When I woke up from the anesthesia, he casually said, "Yep you have stage 3 cervical cancer."

To the financial strain. We been through it all! She said of her daughters: 'The girls are too young to understand, yet they noticed the changes. They would often ask, "When is mommy coming home?" Or "How come mommy keeps going in the ambulance truck?" Being wheeled into the ambulance and waving bye to my kids, only to see them crying for their mommy to stay home, broke me.

Why can't people let a community be happy without trying to ruin it?' MailOnline asked Islington Council yesterday whether any security measures for the installation were likely, but was told there were no planned updates. Banksy fan and photographer Matt Adamiak, 42, took pictures of the artwork this morning.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Tim Clarke for dailymail.co.uk</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/10/82676145-0-image-a-13_1710931366288.jpg" /><figcaption>Matt, from Southampton, said: 'I've always been a Banksy fan so when I saw he'd been out and about I headed up the motorway this morning to have a look. I got there at 6am this morning as it was getting light, there was hardly anyone around - then I noticed someone had thrown white paint or something over it. It's massively noticeable in person - looking at the way it's been thrown it looks like someone's climbed over the fence to throw it. It's difficult to tell how they've done it but they've definitely ruined it. It's all been cordoned off so people can't get in there, but it looks like someone had climbed over - maybe it was someone throwing paint over it to ruin it just because they can, it's difficult to say.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">Tim Clarke for dailymail.co.uk</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/10/82588355-0-image-a-14_1710931385364.jpg" /><figcaption>Islington Council said on Tuesday: 'Culture is a powerful way to tell meaningful stories and we welcome this artwork in Islington, a borough that celebrates creativity. This fantastic piece from Banksy has sparked a real buzz across Islington and beyond, and we very much want the artwork to stay for people to enjoy. We want to find more ways that we can tell important stories through art and culture.' MailOnline has approached the authority for comment on the latest developments. Banksy, who has 12.3million Instagram followers, confirms art is his by posting a picture - and provided this for the Finsbury Park painting at 11.13am on Monday. Prior to the official announcement, the artwork had already been gathering fans at the site on Hornsey Road in north London.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Ella Nunn/PA Wire</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/10/82594077-0-image-a-15_1710931398253.jpg" /><figcaption>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (pictured) said he was 'delighted' to see the artwork in his Islington North constituency. The MP, now sitting in Parliament as an independent, said: 'Banksy's come to Finsbury Park with a bit of greenery in a place that needs a bit more greenery. We're the most densely populated constituency in the country and I'm just delighted. It gives the idea that we could do with much more greenery everywhere and I think that's a really nice message.' Apartment block resident Amy earlier told MailOnline that her housemates and their boyfriends were none the wiser when the green paint was splattered.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Jonathan Brady/PA Wire</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/10/82676153-0-image-a-16_1710931415002.jpg" /><figcaption>She said: 'Our landlord has the whole building and we had a bit of banter with him about it last night and he said, "Don't worry, it's fine". I think it's great for community. This road is a bit of a weird in-between area between Archway and Finsbury Park. It's like it's been fun to be part of our building and it's so nice to see how many people are here.' Estate agent Alex Georgiou, who bought the property in 2012 for £400,000 ($500k) according to land registry records, looked to allay neighbours' fears by claiming he wouldn't be charging more off the back of the area's sudden fame. However, he welcomed interest from potential buyers, as he bullishly told MailOnline: 'You know what, if somebody offered me millions and they can have the building and take the flats with it. Feel free.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">Tim Clarke for dailymail.co.uk</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/10/82588351-0-image-a-17_1710931426760.jpg" /><figcaption>It is understood that the cherry tree in front of the artwork is about 40 to 50 years old and is in declining health. The council's tree service had been maintaining it for some time to help prolong its lifespan and is attempting to keep the decaying tree alive. The last time Banksy's art was revealed in London, it ended in scandal. Two men were arrested and bailed for allegedly using bolt cutters to steal the artwork which pictured a stop sign featuring three military drones.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Ella Nunn/PA Wire</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/10/82676143-13218317-image-a-18_1710931850221.jpg" /><figcaption>Once Banksy announced on social media the artwork belonged to him in an Instagram post shortly after midday on December 23, two men allegedly appeared at the scene and cut down the artwork before running off. Police have yet to recover the piece of art, but one gallery owner told the BBC at the time it could be worth up to £500,000 ($630k).</figcaption><span class="copyright">Tim Clarke for dailymail.co.uk</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/10/82676821-0-Want_more_stories_like_this_from_the_Daily_Mail_Visit_our_profil-a-1_1710931164690.jpg" /><figcaption>Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Construction Partners, who were behind the project, say they have faced £1.2million in extra interest payment charges while awaiting approval from Cornwall Council. The firm based in Exmouth, Devon, now says it can no longer afford to continue the work - despite many of the properties being finished. They include 15 homes allocated for affordable housing - though parish councillors have said many of the other homes, valued at between £500,000 and £800,000, are too costly for most locals.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Aidan Radnedge</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2024-03-21T10:06:39.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle><![CDATA[The new build ghost town abandoned and boarded up amid planning row]]></mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2024-03-21T10:06:39.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>BBC</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/09/82722503-0-image-a-17_1711013172577.jpg" medium="image"><media:title><![CDATA[MailOnline logo]]></media:title><media:text><![CDATA[MailOnline logo]]></media:text><mi:hasSyndicationRights>1</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>2999977</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Daniel Dayment / SWNS</mi:licensorName></media:content><atom:link rel="nofollow" type="text/html" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-68546662" title="New homes boarded up in Cornish village in planning row - BBC News"></atom:link></item><item><title>Shock poll shows Reform UK just FOUR POINTS behind the Tories and closing as Rishi Sunak begs his panicking MPs to 'stick to the plan'</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13222499/Poll-Reform-UK-Tories-Rishi-Sunak-MPs-election.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 09:24:42 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[YouGov research put Nigel Farage-backed Reform UK on 15 per cent, up one over the last week.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">13222499-channel-news</guid><category>news</category><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="mol-para-with-font">A shock poll showed Reform UK just four points behind the Tories today as <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/rishi-sunak/index.html">Rishi Sunak</a> begs his panicking MPs to 'stick to the plan'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">YouGov research put the Nigel Farage-backed outfit on 15 per cent, up one over the last week. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/conservatives/index.html">Conservatives</a> were down one on 19 per cent, with <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/labour/index.html">Labour</a> miles ahead on 44 per cent, according to the study for the Times.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Sunak seized on a bigger-than-expected fall in <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/inflation/index.html">inflation</a> yesterday as evidence that his 'plan is working'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But he has been facing increasing unrest in his ranks, with persistent rumours of a bid to oust him and claims that Commons Leader <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/penny-mordaunt/index.html">Penny Mordaunt</a> is 'on manoeuvres'.</p><div class="slideshow"><cite>Milo Pope</cite><title>Dozens of illegal migrants rescued crossing the English Channel</title><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/01/82629819-13216783-Dozens_of_illegal_migrants_have_been_rescued_after_trying_to_cro-a-13_1710898314657.jpg" /><figcaption>Dozens of illegal migrants have been rescued after trying to cross the English Channel to reach the UK.

The 59-year-old software engineer had been woken up a few hours earlier by his older daughter, Yahali. When she hadn't been able to get through to her father, who was asleep, Oriya had frantically called her sister, telling her that she was in danger. Yahali immediately phoned their father and broke the news that her sister was caught up in a terrorist attack.</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662589-0-image-a-35_1710935182303.jpg" /><figcaption>Oriya, 26, was one of 3,500 revellers at the Supernova music festival near Kibbutz Re'im in southern Israel when thousands of Hamas terrorists launched a surprise attack on the country in the early hours of October 7, murdering 1,200 people. The rampage at the festival left 360 innocent people dead. Eran, who is in London for work when we speak, is softly spoken with a kind face. His face lights up when he tells me about Oriya's childhood: their fond memories skiing, camping by the sea every summer and going on safari in Tanzania. 'She was a terrible teenager,' he laughs. 'All the white hairs on my head are because of her. She loved parties.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662595-0-image-a-36_1710935202685.jpg" /><figcaption>The father and daughter enjoyed a close relationship and would regularly meet for Friday night dinners. 'My cooking improved because of her,' he smiles. But look into his eyes and it's clear that he's a broken man. Eran doesn't blame the police or the army for what happened that day. 'No death or revenge will bring Oriya back,' he says. He is, however, more critical of Israel's government.</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662587-13218545-image-a-43_1710935355891.jpg" /><figcaption>Eran is part of a campaign group, Families of October 7, who have been demanding answers on how the attack happened, as well as better assistance for the bereaved. They have also called for the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose popularity has dropped markedly since the war broke out.</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662585-0-image-a-37_1710935229938.jpg" /><figcaption>'We've told the government to take responsibility for what happened. We don't trust them,' he says. 'I just want a new government that will work for the Israeli people. My dream is to make peace with our Arab neighbours. This government can't do it. We don't want another blitz against Israel.' He cries as he recalls that final conversation with the youngest of his three daughters, who sported long, colourful nails, with dreams of becoming a manicurist. 'I called Oriya on WhatsApp. Her first words to me were: "Daddy, you can't imagine how much I love you. I love you so much. You don't know how sorry I am that I couldn't meet you yesterday for coffee".'</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662593-0-image-a-38_1710935239915.jpg" /><figcaption>Oriya and her two friends, brother and sister Sharon and Schahar Manzur, were in a car, having managed to escape the gunmen at the festival. They were desperately trying to seek sanctuary at Kibbutz Mefalsim, near the Gaza border. Just 500 yards from the kibbutz gates, their car flipped over after being shot at by terrorists wearing Israeli police uniforms. Schahar was dying in Oriya's arms. Sharon had called her brother in desperation, but he was killed by the terrorists on his way to try to rescue her. 'At first I thought Oriya was on drugs, because who can believe this sort of talk in the morning?' says Eran. 'I was on the phone to her and called the police at the same time, trying to get them help. She said to me: "Daddy, there is nowhere to hide". I said to her: "Do not talk to anyone, save your phone battery and go to hide".'</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662579-0-image-a-39_1710935274876.jpg" /><figcaption>With gunshots getting louder in the background, Oriya must have known the terrorists were close by. Perhaps it was at that point that she realised what horrific fate would befall her. In grim anticipation, she started messaging her loved ones: her big sisters Lia and Yahali, and her boyfriend Yishai. 'She wrote to her sister: "You're everything to me, goodbye". She said to me: "Do not come here, they will kill you". She was very brave for telling me not to come. She was so calm.' The memory is too much for Eran, who again breaks down in tears. After taking a minute to compose himself, he adds: 'It's a horrifying feeling, to see terrorists coming to you with guns, to not know if you're going to be killed, [sexually assaulted] or to be taken as a hostage. It's terrible to die like this.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662563-0-image-a-41_1710935297672.jpg" /><figcaption>When Hamas unleashed unspeakable horror on Israel, they snatched 240 hostages and took them to the Gaza Strip. About 130 are still being held, but it is thought that perhaps 30 of them are dead. Oriya was last active on her phone at 8.45am. Her family hoped - prayed - that she had been taken hostage, and they would be reunited with her one day. On October 10, Oriya's boyfriend Yishai went to the site of the attack. There were several bodies lying under a eucalyptus tree, many unrecognisable. Yishai identified her by the distinctive flower tattoo on her abdomen. She had been shot in the stomach. Eran has since visited that spot, now full of foliage and no longer as barren as it was back in October. 'If that attack had happened now, five months later, [the people escaping the terrorists] would have had somewhere to hide,' he says.</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662581-0-image-a-42_1710935313668.jpg" /><figcaption>Oriya was buried on October 15 in Caesarea, a northern town on Israel's Mediterranean coast. 'One of my daughters just doesn't function anymore,' says Eran. 'She can't even cook for herself. She doesn't even go to the supermarket. We're all living in trauma. I went to sleep one person on October 6 and woke up a different person on the morning of October 7.' Attempts to broker a ceasefire are ongoing, though peace still seems a long way off. Any deal for a pause in the fighting would see Hamas freeing some Israeli hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. Eran, meanwhile, is remaining optimistic. 'I really hope the hostages will return. It will let us breathe again. Right now, we're living in dark times. We just want a normal like you have in London. We want our hostages back.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82679943-0-Want_more_stories_like_this_from_the_Daily_Mail_Visit_our_profil-a-19_1710935066626.jpg" /><figcaption>Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The pictures were released by Macron's official photographer Sazig de la Moissonniere and show the French leader in a boxing gym yesterday, where he flexed his muscles as he hit a punching bag.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Soazig de la Moissonnie¿re/Pre¿sidence de la Re¿publique</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82697255-0-image-a-26_1711006350669.jpg" /><figcaption>His face set in a determined grimace, Macron aimed to show off his fighting spirit and determination after military experts said he is bidding to lead NATO as a 'Napoleon'. Macron's cringe-worthy portrayal of strength with the boxing photos resemble similar attempts by Russian president Putin, whose office previously released photos of him beating an opponent in Judo, playing ice hockey or riding shirtless on a horse.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Soazig de la Moissonnie¿re/Pre¿sidence de la Re¿publique</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82487895-0-image-a-27_1711006369179.jpg" /><figcaption>The pictures come amid repeated warnings by Macron, who said sending Western ground troops into Ukraine should not be 'ruled out' and urged European leaders not to be 'cowards' when it comes to the defence of Ukraine. His comments on ground troops - a break from other NATO countries - caused alarm among Ukraine's western backers, who have long viewed sending troops into the country currently besieged by Russia as a red line that must not be crossed.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Eric Tschaen- Pool/SIPA/Shutters</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82484481-0-image-a-28_1711006378783.jpg" /><figcaption>What was meant to be a galvanising call from Macron to bolster support for Kyiv has instead driven a wedge between the EU's two largest powers - France and Germany - with Berlin promptly affirming it would not be sending its troops to Ukraine. Other key players in the European sphere of influence, including NATO members Britain and Poland , have also been quick to stamp out Macron's suggestion.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Abdullah Firas/ABACA/Shutterstoc</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82506895-0-image-a-29_1711006389830.jpg" /><figcaption>Some welcomed the 'strategic ambiguity' of his remarks - the importance of never announcing your intentions to an adversary. But Macron's comments also prompted fierce rebuke from Vladimir Putin, who quickly threatened 'weapons exist in order to use them' in an interview on Russian state TV in reference to the possibility of deploying nukes should Western troops be deployed in Ukraine. Macron chastised Putin for threatening the use of nuclear devices and reminded him France also has an advanced weapons programme in interviews with French media last week.</figcaption><span class="copyright">POOL/AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82487889-0-image-a-30_1711006399434.jpg" /><figcaption>He also declared his nation 'ready' to use nuclear weapons in an uncharacteristically brash retort to Vladimir Putin following the latest bout of nuclear sabre-rattling from the Kremlin chief. 'We must first and foremost feel protected because we are a nuclear power. We are ready; we have a doctrine (for the use of nuclear weapons),' Macron told reporters, saying the Kremlin's willingness to issue nuclear threats was inappropriate. Having nuclear weapons 'imposes on us the responsibility never to escalate,' Macron said, in a dig at the constant reminders issued by top Russian officials and media personalities of their nuclear arsenal.</figcaption><span class="copyright">EPA </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/81831531-0-image-a-31_1711006407753.jpg" /><figcaption>In some of his latest comments about the war, Macron said last week that a Russian victory in Ukraine 'would reduce Europe's credibility to zero' as he again refused to rule out deploying troops. The French leader spoke on French TV about how to further support Ukraine and the interview was aimed at clarifying his policy that the sending of ground forces was not on the agenda now, but Europe must keep 'all options' open in case the war spread. He said that responsibility for prompting such a move would lie with Moscow as France would not lead an offensive into Ukraine. He said: 'It wouldn't be us,' but later added: 'To have peace in Ukraine, we must not be weak.' 'If Russia wins this war, Europe's credibility will be reduced to zero,' Macron told French broadcasters TF1 and France 2 television.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Anadolu via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/81831231-13222205-image-a-32_1711006651611.jpg" /><figcaption>He also said that the continent's security was 'at stake' in the conflict which he said is 'existential for our Europe and for France'. Macron later added in a video on social media that Moldova, Romania and Poland could be under immediate threat if Ukraine lost the war. Calling the conflict in Ukraine 'existential for our Europe and for France', Macron said anybody advocating 'limits' on aid to Ukraine 'chooses defeat'. He said there had been 'too many limits in our vocabulary' since the Russian invasion in February 2022. 'Two years ago we said we would never send tanks. We did. Two years ago, we said we would never send medium-range missiles. We did,' he said. 'Those who say 'let's not support Ukraine' do not make the choice of peace, they make the choice of defeat,' Macron added.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Anadolu via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82400289-13222205-image-a-33_1711006674365.jpg" /><figcaption>His statements come amid a hardening of Paris' stance towards Moscow after Macron abandoned his longstanding efforts to maintain a closer bond with Putin. Britain and France are Europe's only nuclear powers, but even their collective power is a fraction of that employed by Russia, which has the world's largest and most varied collection of nuclear weapons by some margin - even larger than that in Washington's vast stockpiles. Macron openly acknowledges his position has now undergone a major turnaround, citing a 'hardening' in Russia's stance at home and abroad, which has seen the prison death of opposition figure Alexei Navalny that supporters have blamed on the Kremlin, as well as a flurry of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against countries including France.</figcaption><span class="copyright">EPA </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82701397-13222205-image-a-34_1711006687321.jpg" /><figcaption>He has repeated as a mantra that 'Russia cannot win this war' and shocked European allies in February by refusing to rule out the sending of Western ground troops. 'Who would think for a single second that President Putin, who did not respect any of his limits and engagements, would stop there?' he said in an interview with French television on Thursday, insisting there should be 'no limits' in support for Ukraine and describing the war as 'existential' for Ukraine and Europe. Macron met German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has expressed discomfort with France's more bellicose stance, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk for talks in Berlin last Friday. 'If Russia wins the life of the French will change. We will have no more security in Europe,' Macron warned.</figcaption><span class="copyright">RIA NOVOSTI/AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82642711-13222205-image-a-35_1711006705120.jpg" /><figcaption>This comes ahead of a meeting by European leaders in Brussels tomorrow, where the representatives of the 27-nation bloc will discuss the war in Ukraine. 'Into the third year of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, we face a pivotal moment. Urgency, intensity and unwavering determination are imperative,' EU Council President Charles Michel wrote in a letter inviting presidents and prime ministers to the two-day summit in Brussels. 'The swift provision of military aid to Ukraine' is top priority,' Michel wrote. The other, to shore up Europe's defenses. 'Now that we are facing the biggest security threat since the Second World War, it is high time we take radical and concrete steps to be defense-ready and put the EU's economy on a `war footing',' he said.</figcaption><span class="copyright">EPA </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82592337-13222205-image-a-36_1711006722225.jpg" /><figcaption>It's unlikely that all 27 leaders would accept the shift to a war economy that might help produce the weapons and ammunition needed. Hungary for one, Russia's closest ally inside the EU, is suing for peace and refuses to arm Ukraine. Still, the realization that Russia under Putin would pose an existential threat should Ukraine fall has galvanized most of Europe. 'If the Russian president thinks he just has to sit out this war and we will weaken in our support, then he has miscalculated,' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Wednesday. 'Russia is not strong, and it cannot speculate on us letting off in our support. We will continue it for as long as necessary.' Support is growing among some leaders for defence bonds to finance military spending through common debt issuance; the same way the EU raised money for its pandemic recovery fund.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Cover Video</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/61684721-13222205-Want_more_stories_like_this_from_the_Daily_Mail_Hit_the_follow_b-a-37_1711006733102.jpg" /><figcaption>Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

A joint statement from Costner and Baumgartner provided to DailyMail.com read: 'Kevin and Christine Costner have come to an amicable and mutually agreed upon resolution of all issues pertaining to their divorce proceedings.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/12/08/15/75079491-0-They_have_kids_together_Kevin_and_Christine_seen_with_their_chil-a-8_1702047711819.jpg" /><figcaption>The actor and his wife of nearly 20 years have been embroiled in a months-long legal war which has met a surprise end after a report that Baumgartner had received more than $400,000 to pay the costs of the contentious courtroom battle. Costner was previously married to Cindy Silva from 1978 to 1994 and they share three children - Annie, 39, Lily, 36, and Joe, 35. He also shares a son Liam Costner with Bridget Rooney, who he dated after his split with Silva.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Eric Charbonneau/Rex/Shutterstock</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/12/08/15/78739393-0-Jewel_was_married_to_professional_cowboy_Ty_Murray_and_they_shar-a-19_1702048052759.jpg" /><figcaption>Jewel's dating history includes relationships with Sean Penn and NFL star Charlie Whitehurst. She was also married to professional cowboy Ty Murray (pictured together) and they share a 13-year-old son.

Instead, after a two-day hearing in September in which both Kevin and Christine took the stand to testify, a judge ordered Kevin to pay $63,000-a-month for their three children. According to the terms of the settlement, if Christine challenges the judgment 'she would have to repay Kevin more than $1million and pay his attorney's fees for the prenup fight.' Upon hearing this, she 'agreed to the terms of a 3-page settlement letter.' Although the prenup is enforceable, Christine got more than what was prescribed in the agreement. Christine had vowed to fight it out in court with a trial due to take place in December, which will no longer happened. Read the full story: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/usshowbiz/article-12841747/Kevin-Costner-Jewel-Richard-dating.html?ito=msngallery</figcaption><span class="copyright">FilmMagic</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/12/08/15/61684721-0-Want_more_stories_like_this_from_the_Daily_Mail_Visit_our_profil-a-13_1702047798326.jpg" /><figcaption>Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Stephen Bungay, 48, (left) has owned Ockham Bites (inset), in Cobham, Surrey just off junction 10, for almost 22 years, but says he has lost £135,000 of business since work began to upgrade that section of the motorway 18 months ago. The £317million project, which is scheduled to shut the M25 four more times before September, saw motorists in five-hour delays last week as a section closed over a full weekend for the first time. Mr Bungay claims the roadworks make it difficult for people to reach his cafe and the hours of delays mean those who do pop in are often doing so to use his bathrooms, without buying anything. The destruction of surrounding woodland and reduced parking availability on the construction site, run by Balfour Beatty, has added further disruption.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Lettice Bromovsky</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2024-03-21T08:00:45.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle><![CDATA[Pit stop faces closure after losing £135,000 of trade in M25 upgrade]]></mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2024-03-21T08:00:45.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>emma watson (old)</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/07/82719631-0-image-a-3_1711007031099.jpg" medium="image"><media:title><![CDATA[MailOnline logo]]></media:title><media:text><![CDATA[MailOnline logo]]></media:text><mi:hasSyndicationRights>1</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>3434229</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Nick Edwards For dailymail.co.uk / Nick Edwards for dailymail.co.uk</mi:licensorName></media:content></item><item><title>Fitness First, Goodlife: Wages victory for gym chain staff after they rebelled against 15-YEAR pay freeze after name-and-shame campaign went viral</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13213051/FitnessFirst-Goodlife-Wages.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 06:02:39 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[The petition by the United Workers Union (UWU) claims group fitness instructors at Fitness First and Goodlife Health Clubs had been paid at the same rate, $42.50 per class, for the past 15 years.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">13213051-channel-news</guid><category>news</category><content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"><li class="class"><strong>Fitness instructors win battle for pay rise </strong></li><li class="class"><strong>Hadn't had a wage increase in 15 years </strong></li><li class="class"><strong>READ MORE: <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13201049/Tens-thousands-Aussies-set-pay-rise-28-CENT-line-cash.html">Tens of thousands of Aussies are set to get a pay rise </a></strong></li></ul><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fitness instructors at two of Australia's largest chains of gyms have been granted a pay rise after an online petition won the support of thousands when it went viral.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The petition by the United Workers Union (UWU) claims group fitness instructors at Fitness First and Goodlife Health Clubs had been paid at the same rate, $42.50 per class, for the past 15 years. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While their pay plateaued for a decade-and-a-half, customer's gym fees were increasing alongside profits for parent company, Fitness and Lifestyle Group (FLG), union bosses said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instructors were reportedly struggling to pay for rent and bills as their pay remained stagnant while the cost-of-living dramatically spiked.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After reportedly knocking back negotiation talks, FLG agreed a deal within two weeks of the petition going live and increased staff pay by between 6 and 8 per cent.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/05/82716143-13213051-Fitness_instructors_employed_by_the_parent_company_of_two_of_Aus-a-30_1710999720062.jpg" height="359" width="634" alt="Fitness instructors employed by the parent company of two of Australia's largest gyms, Fitness First (pictured) and Goodlife, have won a battle to have their pay increased" data-licensor-name="Fitness First Australia/Facebook" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS news" data-version="2" id="mol-83906ca0-e734-11ee-86f5-dbcb25287586">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">READ MORE: <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13138793/Seek-survey-reveals-one-thing-likely-Aussies-pay-rise-nations-cost-living-crisis.html">Seek survey reveals the one thing most likely to get Aussies a pay rise </a></h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">UWU director, Godfrey Moase, said the pay issue had forced the instructors into unionising to confront FLG as a group.</p><div class="slideshow"><cite>Sarah Ewall-wice, Senior U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com In Washington, Dc</cite><title>Wall Street banker Marty Dolan launches primary bid to unseat AOC</title><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/15/18/82522193-13202743-Congresswoman_Alexandria_Ocasio_Cortez_has_a_challenger_in_the_D-a-166_1710528966307.jpg" /><figcaption>Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has a challenger in the Democratic primary for the New York 14th Congressional District seat.

'Safety is our highest priority and is at the center of everything we do,' Kirby said in an email to customers on Monday. 'Unfortunately, in the past few weeks, our airline has experienced a number of incidents that are reminders of the importance of safety.' The FAA is investigating the worrying incidents, which Kirby described as 'all unrelated' in the email.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/19/19/79920133-13215803-He_added_United_Airlines_is_reviewing_details_of_each_incident_a-a-30_1710876110201.jpg" /><figcaption>He added United Airlines is reviewing details of each incident 'and using those insights to inform our safety training and procedures across all employee groups.' The aviation industry came under the microscope over the string of recent mishaps, beginning with a door blowing off an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 on January 5. Just last week, a United Airlines Boeing 737-824 from San Francisco was grounded after it was found to be missing a panel when it touched down at Medford Airport in Oregon.</figcaption><span class="copyright">AP</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/19/19/82531535-13215803-Jackson_County_Airport_Director_Amber_Judd_said_the_panel_fell_o-a-31_1710876110203.jpg" /><figcaption>Jackson County Airport Director Amber Judd said the panel fell off the 25-year-old plane mid-flight, and that no injuries were reported by passengers or crew. While three days before, a Boeing jet was forced to land due to hydraulic fluid spewing from its landing gear area. It was also a United Airlines Flight. Also under investigation, the forced landing happened as the San Francisco-bound 777-300 embarked from Sydney, with fluid filmed leaking from its undercarriage. Boeing is now instructing airlines to inspect switches on pilots' seats in its flagship 787 Dreamliner jets - after a published report said an accidental cockpit seat movement likely caused the sudden plunge of a LATAM Airlines plane earlier this week.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Jackson County Airport Authority</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/19/19/82511649-13215803-It_said_it_recommended_airlines_inspect_the_motorized_cockpit_se-a-24_1710876110134.jpg" /><figcaption>It said it recommended airlines inspect the motorized cockpit seats the next time they perform maintenance. The aircraft manufacturer went on to point to instructions that include how to disable motors that move the seats in its 787s, before billing the advisory as no more than a 'precautionary measure.' It also comes less than a week after a former Boeing staffer was found dead by an apparent [self-murder] while doing depositions for a suit he filed against the firm alleging he witnessed second-rate parts being fitted on planes. The FAA has since revealed the firm failed 33 of 89 audits during an exam of Boeing's 737 Max - a model it had been planning to update with the long-delayed Max 10.</figcaption><span class="copyright">AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/19/19/82554239-13215803-After_the_incident_and_the_several_before_United_Airlines_reques-a-25_1710876110164.jpg" /><figcaption>After the incident - and the several before - United Airlines requested the firm halt work on the unreleased jets: an apparent sign of carriers' diminishing faith. The Boeing whistleblower found dead, 62-year-old John Barnett (pictured), had given stark warnings over the aviation giant's 787 Dreamliner and 737 Max models specifically in an interview, just weeks before his death. In the midst of a deposition in a whistleblower lawsuit in Charleston related to the production of the 787 Dreamliner plane, Barnett was found with a 'self-inflicted' gunshot wound in the parking lot of a hotel in Charleston, South Carolina. The FAA is investigating nine incidents this month alone involving United planes. Whitaker's interview with host Holt airs tonight on NBC Nightly News at 6.30 pm ET.

'I am not happy with the problems of my competitor. They are not good for the industry a whole,' Faury said when asked about Boeing. 'We are in an industry where quality and safety is top priority,' he added.

The aviation industry came under the microscope over the string of recent mishaps, beginning with a door blowing off an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 on January 5. Just last week, a United Airlines Boeing 737-824 from San Francisco was grounded after it was found to be missing a panel when it touched down at Medford Airport in Oregon.</figcaption><span class="copyright">AP</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/19/19/82531535-13215803-Jackson_County_Airport_Director_Amber_Judd_said_the_panel_fell_o-a-31_1710876110203.jpg" /><figcaption>Jackson County Airport Director Amber Judd said the panel fell off the 25-year-old plane mid-flight, and that no injuries were reported by passengers or crew. While three days before, a Boeing jet was forced to land due to hydraulic fluid spewing from its landing gear area. It was also a United Airlines Flight. Also under investigation, the forced landing happened as the San Francisco-bound 777-300 embarked from Sydney, with fluid filmed leaking from its undercarriage. Boeing is now instructing airlines to inspect switches on pilots' seats in its flagship 787 Dreamliner jets - after a published report said an accidental cockpit seat movement likely caused the sudden plunge of a LATAM Airlines plane earlier this week.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Jackson County Airport Authority</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/19/19/82511649-13215803-It_said_it_recommended_airlines_inspect_the_motorized_cockpit_se-a-24_1710876110134.jpg" /><figcaption>It said it recommended airlines inspect the motorized cockpit seats the next time they perform maintenance. The aircraft manufacturer went on to point to instructions that include how to disable motors that move the seats in its 787s, before billing the advisory as no more than a 'precautionary measure.' It also comes less than a week after a former Boeing staffer was found dead by an apparent [self-murder] while doing depositions for a suit he filed against the firm alleging he witnessed second-rate parts being fitted on planes. The FAA has since revealed the firm failed 33 of 89 audits during an exam of Boeing's 737 Max - a model it had been planning to update with the long-delayed Max 10.</figcaption><span class="copyright">AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/19/19/82554239-13215803-After_the_incident_and_the_several_before_United_Airlines_reques-a-25_1710876110164.jpg" /><figcaption>After the incident - and the several before - United Airlines requested the firm halt work on the unreleased jets: an apparent sign of carriers' diminishing faith. The Boeing whistleblower found dead, 62-year-old John Barnett (pictured), had given stark warnings over the aviation giant's 787 Dreamliner and 737 Max models specifically in an interview, just weeks before his death. In the midst of a deposition in a whistleblower lawsuit in Charleston related to the production of the 787 Dreamliner plane, Barnett was found with a 'self-inflicted' gunshot wound in the parking lot of a hotel in Charleston, South Carolina. The FAA is investigating nine incidents this month alone involving United planes. Whitaker's interview with host Holt airs tonight on NBC Nightly News at 6.30 pm ET.

To the financial strain. We been through it all! She said of her daughters: 'The girls are too young to understand, yet they noticed the changes. They would often ask, "When is mommy coming home?" Or "How come mommy keeps going in the ambulance truck?" Being wheeled into the ambulance and waving bye to my kids, only to see them crying for their mommy to stay home, broke me. And watching my husband break down in tears, was rough.' She added of her spouse: 'I gotta say, this was the toughest storm I have ever been through.

Or having premarital [sexual intercourse] in Idaho ? Be careful, lest you wind up on the wrong side of the law. Dozens of archaic and bizarre old laws still remain on the books across the U.S., criminalizing many behaviors with months in jail, hundreds of dollars in fines and even hard labor. Some of these decade-old laws have even more interesting stories - it became illegal to drop a moose out of a plane in Alaska after an animal rights group misunderstood a local game. In other states, laws have failed to change with the times and police simply do not enforce them - as is the case with Alabama 's law against gaming on Sundays. Here is a list of some of the most bizarre decades-old laws that are still on the books in the U.S.</figcaption><span class="copyright">None</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/15/16/82498481-13202181-image-a-19_1710518667388.jpg" /><figcaption>Heap of various pills on color background; Shutterstock ID 705270160; purchase_order: -; job: -; client: -; other: -</figcaption><span class="copyright">Shutterstock / Alexander Khoruzhenko</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/15/16/82508859-0-image-a-17_1710518504187.jpg" /><figcaption>Young Man Using Cellphone While Her Wife Sitting On Bed At Night; Shutterstock ID 1196509066; purchase_order: -; job: -; client: -; other: -</figcaption><span class="copyright">Shutterstock / Andrey_Popov</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/15/15/81993423-0-The_type_of_salmon_are_also_anadromous_which_means_they_hatch_in-a-12_1710518338162.jpg" /><figcaption>Often called 'noodling,' the practice of fishing with just hands for large freshwater fish is a bit strange but not all that rare in the U.S. But in Indiana, it is against the law . In fact, it's lumped in with dynamite, guns, poison, and electricity as 'unlawful means of taking fish' in the Indiana legal code. If a person is accused of violating Indiana fish and wildlife regulations, the state can seize any equipment as evidence, and confiscate it if the suspect is convicted. It is not likely that the state would confiscate a person's hands, though.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/15/15/82483703-0-image-a-13_1710518350982.jpg" /><figcaption>In most cases with the laws on this list, states simply stopped enforcing old laws that once had rational reasons behind them. This one, though, criminalized a behavior based on a misunderstanding. The residents of Talkeetna, Alaska, used to play a game involving moose poo that was a twist on bingo. Moose poo with numbers painted on it was dropped from an airplane, and when someone found the right pie, they won. Animal rights group PETA, misunderstanding the game, lobbied the state government to make it illegal to push a moose from a plane.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Getty Images/iStockphoto</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/15/15/82420421-0-image-a-14_1710518395922.jpg" /><figcaption>In the Land of 10,000 Lakes, it is against the law to grease a pig - or barnyard fowl. Specifically: 'No person shall operate, run or participate in a contest, game, or other like activity, in which a pig, greased, oiled or otherwise, is released and wherein the object is the capture of the pig, or in which a chicken or turkey is released or thrown into the air and wherein the object is the capture of the chicken or turkey.' Violations of this 1971 law are considered misdemeanors, punishable by a fine or possible jail time.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Shutterstock / Julia Lototskaya</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/15/16/82485123-0-image-a-15_1710518415478.jpg" /><figcaption>In the state of Kansas, which is home to desirable game animals including the American bison, it is illegal to hunt from a motorboat. Hunting from an aircraft, car, or other vehicle is also illegal. There are some exceptions to this law, though: People who are hunting with a disability permit may use a vehicle, and hunting waterfowl from a boat that is not moving are both considered legal. Coyote hunting is also exempt from most of Kansas's hunting laws, as the animal is considered a threat to livestock.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Shutterstock / CLP Media</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/15/16/82470891-0-image-a-16_1710518500063.jpg" /><figcaption>This law still on Idaho's books has been around since 1972, when [sexual relations] before marriage was more frowned upon than it is today. The law states: 'Any unmarried person who shall have sexual intercourse with an unmarried person of the opposite [gender] shall be deemed guilty of fornication, and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $300 or by imprisonment for not more than six months or by both such fine and imprisonment.' At the discretion of a judge, though, the sentence can be suspended, or a defendant can be given probation instead of prison time.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Shutterstock / Thanakorn.P</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/15/16/82486425-13202181-Part_of_a_set_of_laws_governing_gambling_this_Arkansas_law_prohi-m-21_1710518740897.jpg" /><figcaption>Part of a set of laws governing gambling, this Arkansas law prohibits residents from operating a pinball machine that can give a player more than 25 free games. Other laws in this section of the Arkansas legal code include one that prohibits coin-operated gaming devices if inserting more coins increases a player's odds of winning.

/><figcaption>One of 2024's most eagerly anticipated launches, Netflix's 3 Body Problem, from the Game Of Thrones creators, had high expectations to live up to. But the crime-science flick, based on the Chinese bestselling novels, has fallen flat, with critics slamming its complex plot and moments of 'teeth-grinding boredom'.</figcaption><span class="copyright">ED MILLER/NETFLIX</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/14/82722161-0-The_eight_part_series_which_reportedly_had_a_budget_of_125millio-a-30_1711030436381.jpg" /><figcaption>The eight-part series, which reportedly had a budget of £125million, begins in Communist China during the height of mad despot Chairman Mao's genocide in the 1960s, before leaping forward to Britain in the present day where scientists are being driven out of their senses, and killed, by unexplained phenomena. Computer engineer and science fiction writer Liu Ciux's The Three-Body Problem - the first in a trilogy of novels called Remembrance of Earth's Past - was firmly placed in the 'unadaptable' category due to being filled to the brim with scientific jargon.</figcaption><span class="copyright">ED MILLER/NETFLIX</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/14/81604627-0-But_it_is_a_challenge_Game_of_Thrones_duo_David_Benioff_and_DB_W-a-29_1711030436221.jpg" /><figcaption>But it is a challenge Game of Thrones duo David Benioff and DB Weiss were determined to conquer. Whether they succeeded or not remains to be seen. The Netflix series, which dropped on the streaming site on Thursday, has been criticized by reviewers for managing to both be dull and too confusing. Writing for the Daily Mail, Christopher Stevens said: 'Like a rocket disintegrating on lift-off, the show promptly hurtles off in several directions at once ¿ with some parts plowing straight into the ground.</figcaption><span class="copyright">REUTERS</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/14/82731219-0-Benioff_and_Weiss_have_no_idea_whether_they_re_making_a_philosop-a-34_1711030436402.jpg" /><figcaption>Benioff and Weiss have no idea whether they're making a philosophical thriller, a historical epic about the cultural revolution, a bog-standard crime drama (complete with shambling, chain-smoking maverick copper who has one last chance to save his career), a rom-com, a horror movie or a trailer for a video game. 'The result is that everything looks derivative and unconvincing. Worst of all, as the British researchers tell each other repeatedly that "science is broken", there are long stretches of teeth-grinding boredom.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">Courtesy of Netflix</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/14/82724577-0-The_Independent_s_Louis_Chilton_echoed_his_sentiments_with_a_dam-a-31_1711030436382.jpg" /><figcaption>The Independent's Louis Chilton echoed his sentiments with a damning review, writing: 'No book is really unadaptable; the problem is that rendering it on screen will simply be too dull, or confusing and 3 Body Problem is somehow both. Benioff, Weiss and Woo made radical and transformative changes to the source material, but lost something integral in the process. 'We're left with a series that's full of bluster but no vibrancy ¿ a body devoid of life.' Writing for The Guardian, Lucy Mangan slammed the writers' attempt at emulating their Games Of Thrones success.</figcaption><span class="copyright">Jonathan Brady/PA Wire</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/14/82732145-0-She_wrote_There_are_puzzles_to_solve_if_you_are_capable_but_noth-a-33_1711030436401.jpg" /><figcaption>She wrote: 'There are puzzles to solve, if you are capable, but nothing and no one to root for. 'Even its design as a metaphor for the climate crisis and human inertia in the face of potential doom doesn't give it enough heft ¿ in fact, such is the way of these things, it may even serve to alienate us further from emotional engagement. It won't be Netflix's answer to Game of Thrones.' And Dan Einav of the Financial Times said: 'While the series initially manages to offset early confusion with gripping suspense, slick pacing and well-timed reveals, it becomes unwieldy as it progresses.</figcaption><span class="copyright">REUTERS</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/14/82722157-0-_Characters_saddled_with_explaining_abstruse_mechanical_theories-a-32_1711030436382.jpg" /><figcaption>'Characters saddled with explaining abstruse mechanical theories, meanwhile, never really seem to have more than one dimension themselves.' Not all critics were underwhelmed, however, with several commending the much-anticipated series. The i's Emily Baker applauded the series, writing: 'It's fast-paced, zooming through storylines and ideas at breakneck speed. Thankfully, the whole season is available to binge ¿ I don't think I could've stood to wait a week for each chapter. It's not just mind-bending, it's mind-melting ¿ in the most enjoyable way.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">None</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/14/82731253-0-Although_its_plot_complexity_was_heavily_criticized_Empire_s_Joh-a-36_1711030436505.jpg" /><figcaption>Although its plot complexity was heavily criticized, Empire's John Nugent felt the weaving of storylines was successful. He wrote: 'It is part police-procedural potboiler, part historical-fiction epic, part puzzle-box mystery, part scientific-discovery adventure, part alien-invasion sci-fi. That it feels coherent at all is an achievement. At its heart lies the question of what it means to be human.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">ED MILLER/NETFLIX</span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/21/14/82732221-0-And_writing_for_The_Irish_Independent_Pat_Stacey_firmly_placed_h-a-38_1711030436506.jpg" /><figcaption>And writing for The Irish Independent, Pat Stacey firmly placed himself as a roaring fan, saying: 'Brilliantly produced, pacy and featuring excellent performances, it provides food for the brain as well as a feast for the eyes. It also has something you don't always find in the sci-fi genre ¿ real heart and characters it's easy to become invested in. '3 Body Problem doesn't lend itself to binge-watching; it's so packed with ideas and intrigue, it deserves to be savored.'

The 59-year-old software engineer had been woken up a few hours earlier by his older daughter, Yahali. When she hadn't been able to get through to her father, who was asleep, Oriya had frantically called her sister, telling her that she was in danger. Yahali immediately phoned their father and broke the news that her sister was caught up in a terrorist attack.</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662589-0-image-a-35_1710935182303.jpg" /><figcaption>Oriya, 26, was one of 3,500 revellers at the Supernova music festival near Kibbutz Re'im in southern Israel when thousands of Hamas terrorists launched a surprise attack on the country in the early hours of October 7, murdering 1,200 people. The rampage at the festival left 360 innocent people dead. Eran, who is in London for work when we speak, is softly spoken with a kind face. His face lights up when he tells me about Oriya's childhood: their fond memories skiing, camping by the sea every summer and going on safari in Tanzania. 'She was a terrible teenager,' he laughs. 'All the white hairs on my head are because of her. She loved parties.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662595-0-image-a-36_1710935202685.jpg" /><figcaption>The father and daughter enjoyed a close relationship and would regularly meet for Friday night dinners. 'My cooking improved because of her,' he smiles. But look into his eyes and it's clear that he's a broken man. Eran doesn't blame the police or the army for what happened that day. 'No death or revenge will bring Oriya back,' he says. He is, however, more critical of Israel's government.</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662587-13218545-image-a-43_1710935355891.jpg" /><figcaption>Eran is part of a campaign group, Families of October 7, who have been demanding answers on how the attack happened, as well as better assistance for the bereaved. They have also called for the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose popularity has dropped markedly since the war broke out.</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662585-0-image-a-37_1710935229938.jpg" /><figcaption>'We've told the government to take responsibility for what happened. We don't trust them,' he says. 'I just want a new government that will work for the Israeli people. My dream is to make peace with our Arab neighbours. This government can't do it. We don't want another blitz against Israel.' He cries as he recalls that final conversation with the youngest of his three daughters, who sported long, colourful nails, with dreams of becoming a manicurist. 'I called Oriya on WhatsApp. Her first words to me were: "Daddy, you can't imagine how much I love you. I love you so much. You don't know how sorry I am that I couldn't meet you yesterday for coffee".'</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662593-0-image-a-38_1710935239915.jpg" /><figcaption>Oriya and her two friends, brother and sister Sharon and Schahar Manzur, were in a car, having managed to escape the gunmen at the festival. They were desperately trying to seek sanctuary at Kibbutz Mefalsim, near the Gaza border. Just 500 yards from the kibbutz gates, their car flipped over after being shot at by terrorists wearing Israeli police uniforms. Schahar was dying in Oriya's arms. Sharon had called her brother in desperation, but he was killed by the terrorists on his way to try to rescue her. 'At first I thought Oriya was on drugs, because who can believe this sort of talk in the morning?' says Eran. 'I was on the phone to her and called the police at the same time, trying to get them help. She said to me: "Daddy, there is nowhere to hide". I said to her: "Do not talk to anyone, save your phone battery and go to hide".'</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662579-0-image-a-39_1710935274876.jpg" /><figcaption>With gunshots getting louder in the background, Oriya must have known the terrorists were close by. Perhaps it was at that point that she realised what horrific fate would befall her. In grim anticipation, she started messaging her loved ones: her big sisters Lia and Yahali, and her boyfriend Yishai. 'She wrote to her sister: "You're everything to me, goodbye". She said to me: "Do not come here, they will kill you". She was very brave for telling me not to come. She was so calm.' The memory is too much for Eran, who again breaks down in tears. After taking a minute to compose himself, he adds: 'It's a horrifying feeling, to see terrorists coming to you with guns, to not know if you're going to be killed, [sexually assaulted] or to be taken as a hostage. It's terrible to die like this.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662563-0-image-a-41_1710935297672.jpg" /><figcaption>When Hamas unleashed unspeakable horror on Israel, they snatched 240 hostages and took them to the Gaza Strip. About 130 are still being held, but it is thought that perhaps 30 of them are dead. Oriya was last active on her phone at 8.45am. Her family hoped - prayed - that she had been taken hostage, and they would be reunited with her one day. On October 10, Oriya's boyfriend Yishai went to the site of the attack. There were several bodies lying under a eucalyptus tree, many unrecognisable. Yishai identified her by the distinctive flower tattoo on her abdomen. She had been shot in the stomach. Eran has since visited that spot, now full of foliage and no longer as barren as it was back in October. 'If that attack had happened now, five months later, [the people escaping the terrorists] would have had somewhere to hide,' he says.</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662581-0-image-a-42_1710935313668.jpg" /><figcaption>Oriya was buried on October 15 in Caesarea, a northern town on Israel's Mediterranean coast. 'One of my daughters just doesn't function anymore,' says Eran. 'She can't even cook for herself. She doesn't even go to the supermarket. We're all living in trauma. I went to sleep one person on October 6 and woke up a different person on the morning of October 7.' Attempts to broker a ceasefire are ongoing, though peace still seems a long way off. Any deal for a pause in the fighting would see Hamas freeing some Israeli hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. Eran, meanwhile, is remaining optimistic. 'I really hope the hostages will return. It will let us breathe again. Right now, we're living in dark times. We just want a normal like you have in London. We want our hostages back.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82679943-0-Want_more_stories_like_this_from_the_Daily_Mail_Visit_our_profil-a-19_1710935066626.jpg" /><figcaption>Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

He cries as he recalls that final conversation with the youngest of his three daughters, who sported long, colourful nails, with dreams of becoming a manicurist. 'I called Oriya on WhatsApp. Her first words to me were: "Daddy, you can't imagine how much I love you. I love you so much. You don't know how sorry I am that I couldn't meet you yesterday for coffee".'</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662593-0-image-a-38_1710935239915.jpg" /><figcaption>Oriya and her two friends, brother and sister Sharon and Schahar Manzur, were in a car, having managed to escape the gunmen at the festival. They were desperately trying to seek sanctuary at Kibbutz Mefalsim, near the Gaza border. Just 500 yards from the kibbutz gates, their car flipped over after being shot at by terrorists wearing Israeli police uniforms. Schahar was dying in Oriya's arms. Sharon had called her brother in desperation, but he was killed by the terrorists on his way to try to rescue her. 'At first I thought Oriya was on drugs, because who can believe this sort of talk in the morning?' says Eran. 'I was on the phone to her and called the police at the same time, trying to get them help. She said to me: "Daddy, there is nowhere to hide". I said to her: "Do not talk to anyone, save your phone battery and go to hide".'</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662579-0-image-a-39_1710935274876.jpg" /><figcaption>With gunshots getting louder in the background, Oriya must have known the terrorists were close by. Perhaps it was at that point that she realised what horrific fate would befall her. In grim anticipation, she started messaging her loved ones: her big sisters Lia and Yahali, and her boyfriend Yishai. 'She wrote to her sister: "You're everything to me, goodbye". She said to me: "Do not come here, they will kill you". She was very brave for telling me not to come. She was so calm.' The memory is too much for Eran, who again breaks down in tears. After taking a minute to compose himself, he adds: 'It's a horrifying feeling, to see terrorists coming to you with guns, to not know if you're going to be killed, [sexually assaulted] or to be taken as a hostage. It's terrible to die like this.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662563-0-image-a-41_1710935297672.jpg" /><figcaption>When Hamas unleashed unspeakable horror on Israel, they snatched 240 hostages and took them to the Gaza Strip. About 130 are still being held, but it is thought that perhaps 30 of them are dead. Oriya was last active on her phone at 8.45am. Her family hoped - prayed - that she had been taken hostage, and they would be reunited with her one day. On October 10, Oriya's boyfriend Yishai went to the site of the attack. There were several bodies lying under a eucalyptus tree, many unrecognisable. Yishai identified her by the distinctive flower tattoo on her abdomen. She had been shot in the stomach. Eran has since visited that spot, now full of foliage and no longer as barren as it was back in October. 'If that attack had happened now, five months later, [the people escaping the terrorists] would have had somewhere to hide,' he says.</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82662581-0-image-a-42_1710935313668.jpg" /><figcaption>Oriya was buried on October 15 in Caesarea, a northern town on Israel's Mediterranean coast. 'One of my daughters just doesn't function anymore,' says Eran. 'She can't even cook for herself. She doesn't even go to the supermarket. We're all living in trauma. I went to sleep one person on October 6 and woke up a different person on the morning of October 7.' Attempts to broker a ceasefire are ongoing, though peace still seems a long way off. Any deal for a pause in the fighting would see Hamas freeing some Israeli hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. Eran, meanwhile, is remaining optimistic. 'I really hope the hostages will return. It will let us breathe again. Right now, we're living in dark times. We just want a normal like you have in London. We want our hostages back.'</figcaption><span class="copyright">MURRAY SANDERS </span></figure><figure><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/20/11/82679943-0-Want_more_stories_like_this_from_the_Daily_Mail_Visit_our_profil-a-19_1710935066626.jpg" /><figcaption>Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?
