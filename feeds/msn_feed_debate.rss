<p class="mol-para-with-font">We thought we’d watch a thriller, so I turned to Amazon Prime and found one called Fear.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The description read: ‘Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon and Alyssa Milano star in this riveting suspense-thriller about a passionate romance that transforms into a nightmarish obsession.’ This seemed to tick the right boxes, so I pressed the button to buy it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The film opened at an attractive wooden house beside a lake. A man was running in some woods. As he arrived at the house, I experienced a strong sense of deja vu.</p><img id="i-770c929282fde7aa" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/15/02/6202842-6391607-image-a-13_1542247400916.jpg" height="334" width="634" alt="One of the movies featured Richard Gere, pictured, starring with Kim Basinger " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I think we might have seen this one before,’ I said. And soon the whole plot had come back to me: against her parents’ advice, Reese Witherspoon falls for a young man who turns out to be a psycho, the dog gets killed, and then the dad gets killed and it all ends in a bloodbath.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why hadn’t I remembered seeing it before? I told myself that Fear was an oddly forgettable title, which could be applied to any thriller.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We thought we’d cut our losses, or rather double our losses, but cut our boredom, by ordering another thriller instead. So we clicked on ‘Customers Also Watched...’, and up came a list of other thrillers on offer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">First was Guilty As Sin with Rebecca De Mornay. ‘A hot-shot criminal defence attorney is caught in a web of manipulation by her smooth-talking playboy client accused of murder,’ read the description. Had we already watched this one, too? I certainly didn’t want to be caught out again. So we clicked on the next.</p><img id="i-c835149f2ff9347" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/15/01/6202690-6391607-image-a-12_1542247010526.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="One of the movies on offer featured Mark Wahlberg, pictured right" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Up came Final Analysis with Richard Gere and Kim Basinger. ‘Psychological thriller about a psychiatrist who becomes a murder suspect after allowing himself to become more than professionally involved with two wacky sisters.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Had we seen this one? We had certainly watched a number of thrillers with Richard Gere playing smooth, upmarket characters who either aren’t suspected of what they have done or are suspected of what they haven’t done. In fact, it’s high time an ambitious director cast him as a man who is suspected of what he has done, or — even more radical — isn’t suspected of what he hasn’t done.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Worried we had seen Final Analysis before, I clicked on the next: No Good Deed. ‘Terri is a devoted wife and mother of two, living an ideal suburban life in Atlanta when Colin, a charming but dangerous escaped convict, shows up at her door claiming car trouble.’</p><div class="mol-columnist moduleHalf mol-columnist-module"><div class="item">

In thrillers, charming but dangerous escaped convicts are always showing up at ideal suburban doors, most of them claiming car trouble.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Next! Trapped with Kevin Bacon. ‘When Will and Karen are held hostage and their daughter is abducted, a relentless 24-hour plan is set in motion that will challenge everything they took for granted.’ Next! Deceived with Goldie Hawn. ‘A wife discovers evidence of her husband’s murder.’ Next!

Who could honestly remember whether they have seen it or not?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By now, thrillers have run through every plot variation, countless times: the man who is not who he says he is, the charmer who turns out to be a crazy psycho, the woman who senses there’s someone else in the house, the passionate romance that turns into a nightmarish obsession. And so on, and so on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over time, the suspense thriller has lost all its suspense and all its thrills. Instead, it has become comforting in its predictability, like a cuddly toy, or a digestive biscuit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>We thought we’d watch a thriller, so I turned to Amazon Prime and found one called Fear. he description read: ‘Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon, writes CRAIG BROWN.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Craig Brown for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-11-15T08:09:10.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>CRAIG BROWN: Eek!

In theory, she needs to win a simple majority, 159, to survive. But it is not that simple. When her predecessor John Major was challenged by John Redwood in 1995, he won by 218 to 89. But most agreed if Redwood had scored 100, Major would have been finished.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite Iain Duncan Smith’s fighting talk that her ‘days are numbered,’ it will not be easy for IDS and his European Research Group Brexiteer Tories to get her out. It is made up of around 80 Conservative MPs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If Mrs May lost, or failed to win by enough to cling on, a leadership battle would ensue.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Johnson, Rees-Mogg, David Davis and Penny Mordaunt would be likely to throw their hats in the ring on ‘hard Brexit’ platforms with Cabinet big-hitters Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt offering stability and ‘Remainers’ Amber Rudd, Justine Greening and possibly Boris’s brother Jo, standing with no real hope of winning, but determined to fly the pro-EU flag. The MPs would whittle the candidates down to two – with a final vote by all Tory members.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Davis could capitalise on Tory MPs’ mistrust of Johnson. One or the other could face Javid or Hunt in the party membership play off.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is one issue that unites Conservative MPs at present: fear of another General Election. However, some of Boris Johnson’s supporters say that if he became Prime Minister, he could call a snap election on a ‘no deal’ Brexit manifesto, and if he won, make a Churchillian stand against Brussels with the nation – and a Parliamentary majority solidly behind him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is one problem with this: when Mrs May called a snap election last year she very nearly handed the No.10 key to Corbyn.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And Conservative MPs and voters fear that more than any – or no –Brexit deal. The Tory leadership tangle was summed up by Paul Goodman, editor of the influential ConservativeHome website.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: ‘Having a leadership contest could present more problems than it solves for the Party.’ However, he offered little comfort to Mrs May: ‘It is easy to say Tories calling for her to go are like the boy who cried wolf.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The Prime Minister needs at least 318 votes in the Commons if all 650 MPs turns up - but can probably only be confident of around 230 votes. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The number is less than half because the four Speakers, 7 Sinn Fein MPs and four tellers will not take part. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To win, Mrs May will need to get back around half of the 80 hardcore Tory Brexiteer rebels and secure the support of the 10 DUP MPs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even then she will probably still need the help of dozens of Labour MPs to save her deal and possibly her job. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is how the House of Commons might break down: </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>The Government</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Who are they:</strong> All members of the Government are the so-called 'payroll' vote and are obliged to follow the whips orders or resign.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">We may assume that the majority of the parliamentary Labour Party will vote against.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, almost certainly, will a number of Tory Remainers, including characters such as the ambitious Jo Johnson, who resigned as a middle-ranking minister last week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, Scottish Tory MPs are concerned that the draft agreement may leave the United Kingdom bound by EU fishing rules. Mrs May will have to appease them if she is to count on their support.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the end, though, the outcome of the vote will largely depend on whether enough hard-line Brexiteer Tory MPs, as well as the ten Northern Irish members of the Democratic Unionist Party, are able to swallow their perfectly understandable reservations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I hope they will. I say this in the belief that this deal is seriously flawed. Above all, it apparently ties us into membership of the Customs Union for an unspecified period, and allows us to leave it only if the EU says we can. This is deeply unsatisfactory.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But as former Tory leader William Hague pointed out yesterday morning on the Today programme, there is a very high probability that, if they reject this outline agreement, Brexiteers will find themselves with something which they like even less.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Surely this is a time for realism. We may bemoan the way in which EU negotiators have often run rings around our own. We may chastise Mrs May for calling a general election which wiped out a Tory majority, and left the Government a less formidable partner in its talks in Brussels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Betrayed</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet we are where we are. There is no going back. Irrevocable mistakes have been made. But rather than bemoaning the inadequacies of this deal, Brexiteers should ask themselves how on earth they are going to get a better one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For it seems there are only three plausible alternatives to what Mrs May has come up with.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One is a divisive second referendum, which might lead to our staying in the EU and, if so, would result in many millions of voters feeling bitter and betrayed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The second alternative is that we leave the EU without any deal, and therefore with unimaginable and conceivably disastrous consequences.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even stalwart Brexiteers seem queasy about this prospect, partly because they realise the Government has, to its discredit, made scant preparations for such an eventuality.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The third choice is a Corbyn-led administration which would be more destructive of wealth creation, and more inimical to freedom, than any government that has ever existed in this country.</p><img id="i-b0ea65e9de5d96ca" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/15/01/6200966-6391427-The_third_choice_a_Corby_led_administration_would_be_more_destru-a-17_1542243617190.jpg" height="340" width="634" alt="The third choice: 'a Corbyn-led administration would be more destructive of wealth creation, and more inimical to freedom, than any government that has ever existed in this country'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are no other realistic outcomes at this stage of the proceedings. That may be regrettable, but it happens to be the case.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And since politics is the art of the possible rather than the pursuit of perfection, Brexiteers would be wise to think in practical terms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And actually, even in an agreement deficient in some respects, there are several things that should please Leavers, and make them think the whole process has been worthwhile.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All of us who voted for Brexit should take our minds back to the heady days of June 2016, and imagine what we would have thought then if we had been presented with this draft deal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am sure that, like many others on our side of the argument, I would have been appalled by the idea of our being locked up in the Customs Union without any clear means of getting out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Control</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We would have been shocked that for as long as we remain in this state we will be a rule-taker, not a rule-maker. And we would have been disappointed that dreams of striking our own trade deals have been curtailed, if not extinguished.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I am certain most Leavers on that seemingly distant summer’s day would have been thrilled to learn that the Government has successfully negotiated an agreement which reportedly will give us back control of our own borders — and so able to regulate immigration.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most Leavers would also have been delighted to learn that we will regain fishing rights over our own waters — if Mrs May’s pledge yesterday in the Commons is to be believed — and that the ruinously expensive Common Agricultural Policy has been successfully repudiated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We would also have been cheered that the Government has recovered direction of our foreign policy, and that we are no longer unwilling passengers on a bandwagon heading at ever increasing velocity towards European integration.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And although I am sure most of us would have gulped at the prospect of HMG shelling out £39 billion of our money on a divorce deal, we would have been relieved that our annual net contribution of some £10 billion is coming to an end.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In other words, although Brexiteers have cause to be disappointed by some aspects of this deal, they should not, in their somewhat overdone grief, forget that it delivers many of the benefits for which they have fought over long years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So this is my message to those who have campaigned for Brexit. This deal delivers much of what you want. Accept it. If you don’t, you are likely to end up with something far worse — which may well be nothing at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is one further important consideration.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We Brexiteers always go on about the 17.4 million people who voted Leave. But we tend to forget the 16.1 million who backed Remain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The misgivings of such a large minority should be respected, even though they were on the losing side.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It sometimes seems the most ideologically driven Brexiteers yearn for a resolution that takes no account of the reasonable fears of millions of their fellow Britons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is their country, too.</p><div class="item">

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">What Theresa May has produced may be a muddle in some ways. But one of its virtues is that, because it is not an extreme version of Brexit, it should appeal to many of those harbouring doubts. Who knows, it might help heal our divided country.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shouldn’t Brexiteers, who so often champion our values, cherish the British (perhaps I should say English) quality of compromise? Our great institutions — Parliament, the monarchy, the Church of England — may once have been steeped in blood, but they have flourished because they were able to compromise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Purist</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Knowing Boris Johnson quite well and Jacob Rees-Mogg a little, I can’t believe that these liberal and essentially broad-minded men (yes, even Boris) really want to jettison pragmatism and good sense in favour of fighting in a ditch for a purist cause that is no longer achievable — if it ever was.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for the DUP’s MPs, I have no great insight into their possibly intractable minds, but it’s hard to think they really want to usher in the IRA-loving and wealth-destroying Jeremy Corbyn.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, I don’t know whether this admittedly imperfect deal will be accepted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I just believe, with a slightly heavy heart, that it should be. And perhaps now we can slowly return to being a happier and more united people. </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>STEPHEN GLOVER: 'After a mammoth Cabinet meeting, Theresa May has avoided a mass walk-out over a Brexit deal.

At Westminster the remark caused a mini political explosion.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Andrew Pierce for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-11-15T01:59:32.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>ANDREW PIERCE on the political tectonic plates beginning to shift</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-11-15T01:59:32.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/14/22/6195172-0-image-a-38_1542234045686.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1024224</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>EPA </mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6386657/SARAH-VINE-Meddling-Prince-Charles-earned-right-crowned-King-England.html" title="SARAH VINE: Meddling Prince Charles has earned the right to be crowned King"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6386989/Greek-epic-lost-love-hit-myth-QUENTIN-LETTS-reviews-Hadestown-National-Theatre.html" title="Greek epic of lost love more hit than myth QUENTIN LETTS reviews Hadestown at the National Theatre "></link></item><item><title>Greek epic of lost love more hit than myth QUENTIN LETTS reviews Hadestown at the National Theatre </title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6386989/Greek-epic-lost-love-hit-myth-QUENTIN-LETTS-reviews-Hadestown-National-Theatre.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Nov 2018 01:56:26 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6386989</guid><description><![CDATA[Greek mythology gets a jazz-musical makeover in Anais Mitchell's new play 'Hadestown' (pictured).

<p class="mol-para-with-font"> Life for today's younger generation can be very tough. Finding a job and a home is not easy, with the result that many are still living in the shadow of their parents well into their 20s and 30s.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They remain perennial children for ever in thrall to the older generation. It can't be easy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And then there's <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/prince_charles/index.html" id="mol-3a8c1510-e7a1-11e8-bfec-c1ce99bb30fc">Prince Charles</a>, who turns 70 today.</p><img id="i-3656bb0dc191aace" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/13/23/6149710-6386657-image-m-6_1542150356221.jpg" height="518" width="634" alt="Prince Charles turns 70 today. 'The often overlooked triumph of the Prince of Wales is how much he has managed to achieve despite the constraints placed upon him.'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">At an age when most people are looking forward to retirement, he is still living next door to his parents, still waiting to take on the biggest challenge of his life following one of the greatest acts in royal history.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even if he shares his mother's good health, he will never beat her record as the longest-serving monarch. Nor, I suspect, will he ever occupy the same place in the nation's heart, certainly not while the ghost of Diana still hovers over him. But that is no reason to dismiss Charles, as so many have done over the years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, the often overlooked triumph of the Prince of Wales is how much he has managed to achieve despite the constraints placed upon him. How, despite being seemingly locked in permanent royal limbo, he has somehow forged ahead, in his own idiosyncratic way and at his own pace, shaping his legacy before the crown has touched his head.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, one might argue that had the Queen (God forbid) made way sooner, much of what he has achieved might never have happened.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said as much himself, in a recent BBC documentary marking today's milestone: when he is King he will stop speaking out on topics he feels strongly about, as he is 'not that stupid'.</p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, he will operate within 'constitutional parameters', avoiding politics and taking a more neutral stance on controversial issues.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's clear why he says this: he respects the position of monarch and does not want to undermine it. But in many ways it's a bit of a shame.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For while Charles 'unleashed' hasn't always met with universal approval among the public and his critics, much of what was considered eccentric and 'meddling' about his past behaviour has, with hindsight, turned out to be rather inspired. Or certainly ahead of its time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As he puts it himself: 'If it's meddling to worry about the inner cities as I did 40 years ago, then if that's meddling I'm proud of it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As well he should be. Perhaps if politicians had taken him more seriously all that time ago we wouldn't be facing this devastating epidemic of violence on our streets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His outspoken attacks on the ugliness of modern architecture and shoddiness of modern housebuilding; his warnings about climate change, wildlife extinction and rainforest depletion; his concern for the future of farming and the rural environment; his commitment to organic food and humane husbandry; his interest in studying Islam in pursuit of cultural harmony; his commitment to improving education standards, training and employment opportunities through the Prince's Trust.</p><img id="i-a6b073678bd8df60" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/13/23/6149686-6386657-Prince_of_Wales_poses_for_an_official_portrait_to_mark_his_60th_-m-23_1542151418062.jpg" height="742" width="634" alt="Prince of Wales poses for an official portrait to mark his 60th birthday" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">All of these are issues on which he has spoken out over the decades in the face of fierce opposition and ridicule. And yet, with that dogged determination that has been such an admirable feature of his mother's character, he has ploughed on, undeterred — if not unscathed — by the naysayers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">True, Charles has come across sometimes as hand-wringing and occasionally petulant. Yet it is undeniable that he has used his immense privilege to highlight important, if not always fashionable, issues — and to try to help re-shape the cultural landscape for the better.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, there will always be those who will never forgive him for what happened with Diana. Their marriage was a disaster and her death a tragedy. But just as a wife should not be defined by her husband, so Charles should not be defined by that unhappy union.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Diana was always cast as the romantic in their relationship, he the cold-hearted pragmatist.</p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">But the fact that he eventually married his true love — Camilla — in the face of sustained hostility has always struck me as one of the great romantic gestures of our time, the mark of a man clearly capable of great passion and even courage. As for his children — William and Harry — what greater expression of Charles's talents as a father could there be than these two young men who have overcome their mother's death to build useful, fulfilling lives for themselves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In pictures released today, we see the three of them, surrounded by the women they love, looking closer than ever.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, yes, Charles has made mistakes. But who, as they turn 70, has not? A lesser prince might have spent his life in idle luxury, waiting for his birthright, grumbling about his lot. But not Charles. Even if he were never to wear the crown, he has proven himself worthy of it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So here's to you, Prince Charles. As Churchill said: KBO. Keep bxxxering on, and many happy returns.</p><div class="item">

The moment the debate ended, he ambled out of the Chamber, alone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why was Labour demanding this unprecedented release of so much legal advice? Because Tory Eurosceptics and Democratic Unionists had been agitating to see the legal opinion given to Theresa May by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox. They think Mrs May might lie about her Attorney-General’s advice, just as Tony Blair was suspected of doing before the Iraq war.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Labour’s stance was driven by a desire to create friction between Mrs May and her fidgety troops. Not that Sir Keir Starmer, shadow Brexit Secretary, admitted that. He claimed only high motives, saying it was all because Brexit was so important.

She has been shaken by warnings from British industry that exports to Europe would grind to a chaotic halt if we stayed outside. But securing temporary membership of the customs union carries a cost.</p><div class="item">

<div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It means the UK will not have the ability to strike independent deals with non-EU countries. And that horrifies Brexiteers.

That is the fundamental red line.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party, it has pledged to vote against Mrs May and wants a general election. It may get it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May always knew her Brexit deal was a gamble, but it was a gamble she had to take. The question is whether it will turn into a mutiny that destroys her premiership.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is why last night she invited Cabinet ministers, one by one, into Downing Street in order to persuade them to back her deal ahead of a Cabinet meeting tomorrow. She figured that she has a better chance of persuading them individually.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was a sensible precaution – although I was reminded of one cold, November night back in 1990 when Margaret Thatcher chose to meet her Cabinet individually on the eve of her political destruction.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We may well see more resignations this week, even today. How many and how senior?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Well, the Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom, is strongly tipped to go, but that would not matter that much on its own. But the departure of Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, or Environment Secretary Michael Gove, would be fatal and usher in a period of political instability of a kind we have not seen for more than half a century.</p><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Last year, Britain granted asylum to nearly 15,000 people, of whom about a third were children. To judge by past experience, the vast majority of them — though not all — will become good citizens.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it is hard to imagine that anyone could have had a better case for asylum than Asia Bibi, a 53-year-old Christian Pakistani woman living in fear of her life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A couple of weeks ago, she was released from prison by <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/pakistan/index.html" id="mol-cfe598f0-e6e5-11e8-b036-6d65ab7c752b">Pakistan</a>'s Supreme Court, having spent eight years on death row after being convicted of blasphemy in 2010.</p><img id="i-9ef833118c98f742" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/13/01/6103510-0-image-a-24_1542072313561.jpg" height="979" width="634" alt="Asia Bibi was released from prison by Pakistan¿s Supreme Court, having spent eight years on death row" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Her alleged crime? She had been accused on the flimsiest of evidence of insulting the Prophet Muhammad after a trivial squabble with Muslim neighbours. A mob practically beat her to death after she refused to convert to Islam on the spot.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Abused</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although Pakistan's Supreme Court overturned her conviction last month and she is supposedly now free, Mrs Bibi is in hiding somewhere in Pakistan after hard-line Islamists took to the streets to protest at her release. Fearing more unrest, the Pakistan government won't let her leave the country, which she is desperate to do.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This poor woman has been persecuted, ill-treated and abused. She has done no harm and committed no crime. Her only 'sin' is to be a Christian; specifically, a Roman Catholic. She has been in poor health and probably still is. Could anyone in the world have a better case for asylum?</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">And yet Her Majesty's Government has so far declined to offer Asia Bibi sanctuary, though Christian MPs and peers are lobbying on her behalf. Our chaps in the Foreign Office are thought to be especially queasy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their apparent funk is not entirely contemptible. That is to say, it is just about understandable. Mandarins fear that if Britain rescued Mrs Bibi from her tormentors, they might turn their ire on British interests in Pakistan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No one should underestimate the fanaticism of these diehards. In 2011, the then governor of the Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, was murdered after he attempted to gain clemency for Asia Bibi. Mrs Bibi's own lawyer has fled the country. The Supreme Court judges who released her have been threatened.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And all this is going on in the context of repeated acts of terror by Islamist zealots against Christians, who form a small minority in Pakistan. In recent years, hundreds have been murdered in a spate of bomb attacks on churches.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So it is not altogether surprising that the British Government appears somewhat hesitant. To be blunt, it fears the High Commission in Islamabad could be burnt to the ground if it offers a lifeline to Mrs Bibi. The lives of British nationals in Pakistan might even be at risk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As I say, I can understand the qualms of HMG. I can even sympathise with the predicament of the Pakistan government, whose recently elected prime minister is the Oxford-educated former Pakistan cricket star, Imran Khan.</p><img id="i-b0d37f31c5fa4fac" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/13/01/6103508-6382599-image-a-26_1542072713408.jpg" height="472" width="306" alt="'Bibi had been accused on the flimsiest of evidence of insulting the Prophet Muhammad after a trivial squabble with Muslim neighbours'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Pakistani authorities fear that if they allow Mrs Bibi to leave the country for sanctuary in the UK, or anywhere else, they could precipitate riots and mayhem on the part of medieval-minded bigots who regrettably hold such sway in their country.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the more one thinks about it, the clearer it is that the British Government must not cower in the shadows for fear of provoking these backward bullies, who neither respect the rule of law nor freedom of religion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For what is the point of having an asylum system if the claims of an innocent woman in agony are overlooked? Don't justice, decency and mercy combine to demand that Asia Bibi be helped?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are, I'm afraid, examples of our sometimes dysfunctional asylum system assisting those who wish us ill. Ahmed Hassan was given asylum in 2015 though it was known he had fought as a child soldier for Islamic State. Earlier this year, he was jailed for a minimum of 34 years for launching a terror attack on the London Underground.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last year, two Albanians who had falsely pretended to be persecuted Kosovans were allowed by the Supreme Court to remain in Britain. Not only had Dinjan Hysaj and Agron Bakijasi produced bogus information to obtain citizenship, Hysaj had even been jailed for an attack in a pub.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I could go on. It's not difficult to find instances of people who, despite being granted asylum, go on to commit crimes, sometimes of terror.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In sharp contrast, Asia Bibi is a victim on a heroic scale who has suffered a very great deal despite doing no wrong — and seems certain to go on suffering for as long as she remains in Pakistan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Compassion</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Would I say the same if she were a persecuted Hindu or even a Muslim? Absolutely.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I admit to feeling a special affinity with her because she is a Christian, as I am. I note, too, that there are several million Christians in Pakistan as a result of the conversion of their ancestors under the British Raj. Don't we have a degree of historical responsibility?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I also believe that Christian compassion would require us to help anyone in her predicament, whatever her religion. It is not so much Mrs Bibi's Christian status that marks her out for rescue as our Christian duty to go to her aid. And that, it seems to me, is being hindered by Foreign Office caution.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It may also be that some ministers are scared of a hostile reaction among a handful of Islamic extremists in this country. If so, that would be shameful.</p><img id="i-f4d1fa6b61b4c158" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/31/07/5601652-6336565-image-a-3_1540970400882.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Protest: Supporters of a hardline Islamist party held a protest in Lahore after Ms Bibi's conviction was overturned on Wednesday" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Surely the British Government should not allow the fanatical views of any section of society to interfere with the proper conduct of a civilised nation. To cave in to bullies who threaten intimidation and violence would be a betrayal of this country's values, which are endorsed by decent people of all religions and of none.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sanctuary</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for the Pakistani authorities, I can see they find themselves in an even more delicate quandary because of the millions of fundamentalists who might take to the streets if Mrs Bibi were allowed to leave the country. It is unfortunate that they have so far prevented her doing so, and also that they have agreed not to oppose a petition for a review of the Supreme Court decision to free her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And yet I am sure there are many enlightened Pakistanis, who deplore the hounding of this blameless woman. The Supreme Court judges who released her in defiance of the mob would seem to be people of this sort.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The government in Islamabad has to decide whether it wishes Pakistan to be seen as a country which still observes the rule of law and common decency — or is regarded as a rogue state that can no longer be trusted.</p><img id="i-3b9788ab8d81c317" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/31/15/5618068-6336565-image-a-66_1540998518834.jpg" height="411" width="634" alt="Threats: A poster carried at a protest in Karachi shows Ms Bibi's burning head in a noose" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Britain has some leverage with Pakistan — after all, it receives nearly half a billion pounds of Foreign Aid from us every year — and I hope that ministers will strain every diplomatic muscle to persuade the authorities there that Asia Bibi should be given sanctuary here.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her life remains under threat. She can never be safe in Pakistan. More than any asylum seeker imaginable, she is worthy of our help. If, God forbid, anything should happen to her, there will be blood on British hands.</p><div class="item">

After losing the 2010 General Election, managing to harvest just 29 per cent of votes cast, he tried to hang on by what remained of his fingernails and had to be dragged out of Downing Street four days later.</p><img id="i-2104a522fcc89a51" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/13/01/6109708-6382623-image-a-3_1542073032156.jpg" height="550" width="634" alt="Looking like an extra from a George Romero zombie movie, Gordon became the latest member of the Living Dead to demand a second referendum" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was also the man who signed the Lisbon Treaty in secret, sneaking in through the tradesmen’s entrance to avoid photographers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You may vaguely recall that Blair and Brown gave a solemn promise to hold a referendum on Lisbon and then cynically reneged on it. Major, of course, forced the Maastricht Treaty through the Commons, in the teeth of fierce opposition, and consigned the Conservative Party to 13 years in the wilderness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gordon’s solution to heal the divisions which could only be exacerbated still further by a second referendum would be to establish a new Royal Commission to ‘engage and listen’ to voters’ views.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brilliant. That’s exactly what millions of us had in mind when we voted in 2016.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What Do We Want?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Royal Commission!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Do We Want It?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anyway, what’s wrong with simply accepting the outcome of the biggest single democratic exercise in British history?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The only reason we have bitter divisions in some sections of society is that well-funded, fanatical Remainers refuse to acknowledge the result of the first ‘People’s Vote’ and are determined to reverse it.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sadly this poisonous cohort contains three of our four former PMs. To Call Me Dave’s credit, he has maintained a dignified distance from the self-styled resistance to Brexit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what is it about certain ex-Prime Ministers that persuades them they immediately become sagacious statesmen the moment they leave office, regardless of the mess they left behind?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why do they think they can completely disregard the wishes of those who once voted for them and kept them in the manner to which they always felt entitled?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, all Prime Ministers eventually go mad. It just takes some a little longer than others.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the case of Theresa May, who is still there (for now), she has already managed to convince herself that she is the only person with the wit, imagination and ability to decide what comprises a successful Brexit.</p><img id="i-87e2e4f9dea9db59" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/13/01/6109764-6382623-image-a-5_1542073187659.jpg" height="460" width="306" alt="I think we can safely ignore Gordon¿s views on democracy" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The sad fact is that she possesses precisely none of those qualities. As a direct result of her fatal combination of stubbornness and stupidity, she has achieved the feat of joining the ranks of the Living Dead while still in the job.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the other hand, I suppose it takes a special kind of genius to alienate everybody — Leavers, Remainers, the EU Commission, the DUP, you name it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When you manage to upset both sides of the Johnson family, you’re in big trouble. As I wrote back at the time of the Chequers sell-out in July, she’s hopelessly bungled the negotiations and is prepared to reduce Britain to serf status in her desperation to seal a deal:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Independent sovereign nations do not accept the jurisdiction of unelected foreign judges. Independent sovereign nations do not swallow wholesale rules made by unaccountable foreign bureaucrats. Independent sovereign nations are at liberty to conclude free trade deals with any country in the world.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And for this she wants to bung Brussels £39 billion of our money. Since Chequers, it’s got even worse. No wonder even Remainers like Jo Johnson despair.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">About the only sensible thing Gordon Brown said yesterday was that we can still go back to the EU and tell them the deal on the table won’t wash — despite the fact that Brussels hasn’t even agreed to that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They think Mother Theresa is so feeble that they have been emboldened to demand continued access to Britain’s fishing waters. That would be the ultimate humiliation among many. Grocer Heath gave up our traditional fishing waters to get us in to the EU. Now Mrs May could give them away again so we can ‘leave’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You couldn’t make it up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Gordon’s right. We can go back and renegotiate. Just not with the dismal, defeatist Theresa May in charge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She should have had the decency to resign in July, when it was clear the game was up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The only way forward is for her to fall off her kitten heels, sooner rather than later. After two wasted years of dissembling, betrayal, incompetence and downright surrender to Brussels, Mother Theresa deserves nothing less than an ignominious departure.</p><img id="i-9506284f3026ce96" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/13/01/6109770-6382623-image-a-7_1542073231167.jpg" height="469" width="634" alt="In the case of Theresa May, who is still there (for now), she has already managed to convince herself that she is the only person with the wit, imagination and ability to decide what comprises a successful Brexit" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the Conservative Party can rediscover some backbone and sense of self-preservation they can get rid of her tomorrow without having to trigger a protracted leadership contest, provided they could agree on a single compromise candidate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Who would replace her? Does it really matter? Years ago, when there was talk of a stalking horse candidate standing against Johnny Major, I reckoned a real horse could beat him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So I invited readers to vote for either Major or Red Rum as Prime Minister. Red Rum romped home by a margin of nine to one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The talk in some quarters is that Home Secretary Sajid Javid might be the right fit. He’s bright, has a compelling backstory and, although he sided with Remain during the referendum, is not a committed EU federast.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the downside, when it comes to inspirational public speaking, he has all the charisma of Albert R.N.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But beggars can’t be choosers. And we can’t go on as we are.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even diehard ‘no deal’ Brexiteers like me have to accept, as Mick Jagger said, that you can’t always get what you want.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The best we can probably hope for at this late stage is a Norway For Now deal, which would get us out of the EU with no barriers to frictionless trade. It wouldn’t be ideal, but we could try to pick the bones out of it later.</p><img id="i-b067224f9d7cc3aa" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/13/01/6109878-6382623-image-a-9_1542073297057.jpg" height="405" width="634" alt="You may vaguely recall that Blair and Brown gave a solemn promise to hold a referendum on Lisbon and then cynically reneged on it" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unless the Tories can pull a relatively clean Brexit out of the fire, they will forfeit all trust and credibility and we will be staring down the barrel of a Corbyn government by default.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a just universe, Labour shouldn’t benefit from the Tory disarray. They’re all over the place, too, and will vote down any deal put before Parliament because they want to force a General Election.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Conservatives may be what Terry-Thomas would have called an ‘absolute shower’, but do you really want to live in a country with Corbyn in No 10, McDonnell running the Treasury and Diane Abbott in charge of immigration and the Old Bill?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for the Liberals, at least they managed to provide us with a little light relief.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not only has 82-year old Lord Lester been suspended from the House for offering to make a woman a baroness if she agreed to become his mistress — an allegation that he says is ‘completely untrue.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We also learn that one of their senior advisers has fallen foul of the #MeToo madness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Apparently, he propositioned a female colleague after inviting her to dinner to discuss his party’s ‘Brexit position’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ding, dong!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’ve heard of the missionary position and the lotus position, but the Brexit position is a new one on me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It sounds like something from the best-selling 1972 ‘how to’ manual by Alex Comfort, The Joy Of Sex. Now we’ve got The Joy Of Brexit. Mother Theresa must have been boning up on it recently.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In case you’re wondering exactly what her idea of the Brexit position is, it’s like this:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shackled together, facing both ways at once, with little prospect of an early withdrawal.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: Looking like an extra from a George Romero zombie movie, Gordon became the latest member of the Living Dead to demand a second referendum.

To the likes of  Labour frontbencher Andrew Gwynne, it is a privilege.']]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p class="mol-para-with-font"> To  Labour frontbencher Andrew Gwynne yesterday it was just an attitude to strike, a short-term tactic. Having done it, he leaned back and laughed. He consulted his mobile telephone, affecting languor and chuckling to show how unconcerned he was by the anger he had ignited opposite.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What Gwynne had just done, with the nonchalance of a rambler stepping on a worm cast, was defame philosopher Sir Roger Scruton as a ‘racist’ of the ‘Far Right’ who had abused the ‘privilege’ of free speech.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Friends, you thought free speech a right in our kingdom? To the likes of Gwynne, it is a privilege. Something that must be earned. Something that can be removed – presumably by people who agree with Gwynne.</p><img id="i-715a6607f6266732" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/13/00/4A6F940000000578-0-image-a-8_1542070726826.jpg" height="808" width="634" alt="Andrew Gwynne a Labour frontbencher defamed philosopher Sir Roger Scruton as a ‘racist’ of the ‘Far Right’ who had abused the ‘privilege’ of free speech. Pictured, Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn and Mr Gwynne at the Labour Party local election campaign launch at Stretford Sports Village, Trafford, Manchester" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thinker Scruton was in Labour’s crosshairs because he has been appointed to chair (unpaid) the Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission. For a body devoted to aesthetics it has an ugly name but it hopes to encourage design beauty. The hope is that if new housing developments are not architectural eyesores, the public might support more building. One of the Left’s pastimes is driving Right-wingers off the road. When Righties are appointed to prominent roles, the Left goes tonto, looks at everything they may or may not have said in the past and tries to whip up controversy. They claim certain views are so appalling, the ogres who allegedly hold them should not be allowed anywhere near the levers of state.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You will recall the recent palaver about Toby Young, an educationalist whose past as a gonzo journalist was enough to kill his very decent bid to do public work in schools.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Smother all Righties’ charitable ambitions: that’s the Left’s way. This Gwynne, whiny-voiced, accused Prof Scruton of all manner of improper views. Apparently he hated gays, hated Muslims, was anti-Semitic (hey, he should join the Labour Party!), had called the National Front ‘egalitarian’ and once ‘heaped praise’ on V. Orban, that armlifter in Hungary.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">To the Gwynnes of this world, praise is always ‘heaped’. There are few parliamentarians more pre-cooked in their outrage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You want disgust by the yard? Try Gwynne, a fake little man and nastily ready with a slander, as he showed yesterday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Communities Secretary James Brokenshire calmly said Mr Gwynne had misrepresented Sir Roger. If he looked at what Sir Roger wrote about Mr Orban, for instance, he would find it was, er, the very opposite of the praise Gwynne had alleged. The Labour man’s sole reaction to Mr Brokenshire was to shout the word ‘racist!’, as though that was a dialectic clincher.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Only two Labour MPs, Newcastle Central’s Chi Onwurah (of whom one hoped better) and Eltham’s Clive Efford (half-heartedly), joined the attack on Sir Roger. Neither presented any evidence of the philosopher holding fiendish opinions. Mr Efford just claimed Sir Roger had ‘extreme views’ and was unsuitable for public office. Quite where that leaves Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, it is difficult to say.</p><img id="i-7dd7ea3c2c95999b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/13/00/5955462-0-Sir_Roger_Scruton_English_philosopher_portrait_at_Aldeburgh_Lite-a-2_1542070390986.jpg" height="951" width="634" alt="Sir Roger Scruton, English philosopher, portrait at Aldeburgh Literary Festival, Aldeburgh, Suffolk" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Toby Young was lynched, Tory backbenchers were timid about fighting Left-wing intolerance. Yesterday they were firmer. Richard Bacon (S Norfolk) accused Gwynne of ‘crass and oafish comments’. Sir Edward Leigh (Gainsborough) spoke of ‘student union smear tactics’. ‘Thought police, rentamob,’ said Bob Seely (Isle of Wight). And on a day the BBC reported that academics are having to use pseudonyms to discuss controversial subjects, all that slug Gwynne could do was laugh.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Col Bob Stewart, the Beckenham bumbler, hauled himself to his uprights to aver that Sir Roger’s ‘writing and speeches are pretty good’. Mr Bacon: ‘Better than yours, Bob!’ Col Bob, with a sad throw of the voice: ‘You’re probably right…’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ed Vaizey (Wantage) deplored Labour’s ‘bully-boy’ behaviour but admitted he did not much like Sir Roger’s ‘slightly dodgy neo-Georgian pastiche’ views on architecture. Mr Vaizey, who glorifies himself as a modernist, is not averse to visiting real Georgian country houses for patrician weekends. Perhaps he just doesn’t want hoi polloi to have that sort of a cornice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>QUENTIN LETTS: 'Friends, you thought free speech a right in our kingdom?

<p class="mol-para-with-font">When the guns fell silent on the Western Front on November 11 1918, there was as much a feeling of relief as there was of celebration that the Allies, now supported by the United States of America, had finally prevailed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hardly a community in the country had not felt the agony of war. Only 53 villages in England and Wales could be classified as Thankful Villages – in which all those who marched away to war returned.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The installation of 888,246 poppies in the moat of the Tower of <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-b7f3cff0-e555-11e8-894f-6948939ab532">London</a> four years ago – to mark the onset of hostilities – defined the human cost of the First World War for Britain and her Colonies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Each poppy represented not only a life lost but a family shattered.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The unfathomable scale of the bereavement is the focus of this November’s memorial at the Tower, a sea of flickering candles to mark the Armistice. It is a haunting spectacle. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sympathy and emotion, while important, are not enough, however. And today, as we look back across the century in Remembrance, we should also reflect on the lessons we have learned from the Great War – and the lessons we prefer to ignore.</p><img id="i-d7ec30053b5a2190" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/11/01/6034496-0-image-a-26_1541901454756.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="The unfathomable scale of the bereavement is the focus of this November’s memorial at the Tower" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">How, in the light of that overwhelming sacrifice do we treat today’s Armed Forces, the servicemen and women on whom we rely? What welcome do we give to those returning home with broken minds and bodies? And just how serious are we in recognising the gathering threat of foreign powers?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One guiding light for the exhausted population of 1918 was the thought of a better and very different future – that, in the words of David Lloyd George, the new Britain would be ‘a fit country for heroes to live in’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That hope would turn out to be an illusion. After the initial celebration of the Armistice, hundreds of thousands of soldiers returned from the war to a Great Britain that had changed significantly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The German U-boat campaign to starve Britain into submission had come close to success. The country was nearly bankrupt and food was scarce. Many of the jobs that the men had left to go to war were now filled by women; and many of the men who returned were not the same young men who had gone away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tens of thousands were physically mutilated without arms, legs or sight; and tens of thousands more bore mental scars which, while invisible, were as debilitating as any physical injury ever could be. ‘Shellshock’ was hard to explain and even harder to treat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">True, we know a great more about mental illness and physical injury today, but the devastating effects are with us still. Is the Britain of 2018 ‘a fit country for heroes’, for our wounded service personnel or grieving families? In many ways, sadly, it is not. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The resources committed to alleviating post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental illnesses remain woefully short and the need very great. This year has seen a spike in the number of suicides among serving personnel and veterans of the recent campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p><img id="i-190467e887aa8ecd" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/11/01/6034274-6376265-image-a-25_1541901193596.jpg" height="424" width="634" alt="Sympathy and emotion, while important, are not enough, says former Chief of the General Staff Lord Dannatt" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">In 1918, most returning veterans suffered in silence – it was a generation that did not talk about the war. Today there has been a welcome change in culture which allows those with mental health problems to ask for help. If they have the courage to ask, they must receive what they need, which is why I joined The Mail on Sunday in a successful campaign for a round-the-clock helpline.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘A fit land for heroes,’ was not the only misleading slogan of 1918. The nation had also clung to the belief that the conflict was a ‘war to end all wars’ and continued to do so for years to come.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This proved not merely mistaken but dangerous, and embracing it left Britain vulnerable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the warmth of victory we forgot some of the cold realities, including the lessons of our own success. Take the decision to abandon trench warfare in favour of fast, mobile attacks in 1918, a development that would help bring the war to a close.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The integrated use of tanks, artillery and air power had been conceived by the British, yet it was the Germans who paid attention and developed similar strategies in the years following.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The mobile warfare which broke the deadlock in 1918 had been our innovation, yet we had no answer to the Panzer divisions as they crashed into France in May 1940.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The idea that the Great War had indeed been the ‘war to end all wars’ had other consequences, too. It led to a grudging acceptance and appeasement of Germany’s steady expansion in Europe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We chose largely to ignore the rise of Hitler’s populist Nazi Party and did little as the Rhineland was remilitarised in 1936.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Britain was flirting with disaster and, when rapid re-armament eventually began, it was a race in which we were dangerously behind.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In our failure to take a clear-eyed view of the 1914-18 conflict, we sowed the seeds of yet more terrible destruction. (France, of course, had been under no such illusion and, fearful of having to fight another war against its aggressive neighbour, decided in 1930 to place her faith in concrete and machine guns, and accelerated the construction of the Maginot Line.)</p><div class="item">

This two per cent has bought us the smallest Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force since modern records began.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Decisions on Government spending are political choices, but politicians are influenced by public opinion. And sadly, the received wisdom in Whitehall is that there are no votes in Defence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps they are right, which makes it all the more essential that, as we look back across a long and frequently violent century, we must not only commemorate the losses of the past, but learn its lessons, also.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There must be compassion for our living soldiers, sailors and airmen and for the families – so many of them grieving – who support them. And there must be vigilance about the true state of the world.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Only that way can we ensure that the carnage of a century ago is not repeated.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>LORD DANNATT: The unfathomable scale of the bereavement is the focus of this November’s memorial at the Tower, a sea of flickering candles to mark the Armistice.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Last week, the heartbroken family of another young victim returned to their home in Romania after just a few weeks living here in Britain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-a6a588c0-e554-11e8-a500-b1bd1a4f3fc2">London</a>, they said, was a dangerous place where ‘terrible things can happen in the blink of an eye. If you say the wrong thing to the wrong person you could end up dead’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their own son, Beniamin Pieknyi, was in the wrong place at the wrong time and was stabbed to death in an East London shopping centre – just one more victim of a vicious urban conflict that has already cost hundreds of lives, five in the past week alone.</p><img id="i-f8eab82c1c5b96ec" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/11/01/6034098-0-image-a-71_1541900477247.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Beniamin Pieknyi, 21, was walking through the Stratford Centre in East London when he was chased and stabbed in March" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">This new war has spread to pockets right across the capital, including Tottenham and Wood Green in North London, areas I know well. I grew up a few minutes away and raised my own family in the shadow of nearby Alexandra Palace.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Violence is nothing new. Almost half a century ago, I encountered my own share of knuckle dusters and bicycle chains, and the broken front teeth I see in the mirror are a constant reminder never to drop my guard if I happen – once again – to be facing an enemy with a brick in his hand. But the battles now taking place are different.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The primitive weaponry of my day has been replaced by a lethal armoury of knives, swords, handguns and, occasionally, automatic rifles – some in the hands of children as young as ten.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Three killings have taken place within ten minutes of my own front door this year alone – and shrines have been erected to boys and girls sacrificed in an unwinnable war.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m the son of poor immigrants and have no doubt that, were I a teenager today, I too would be caught up in the carnage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This epidemic of knife crime has not appeared from nowhere. It has been gathering for some time, yet the warnings from me and others were ignored. Even now, the political response has been pathetic, focusing – irrelevantly, in my opinion – on police numbers.</p><img id="i-69cfd6192896fb3d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/08/15/5937882-6365545-This_is_the_shocking_moment_15_year_old_Jai_Sewell_was_stabbed_i-a-31_1541692746351.jpg" height="412" width="634" alt="This is the shocking moment Jai Sewell, 15, was stabbed in Bellingham, South East London" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact there is no evidence that having bobbies on the beat will deter teenage thugs. The chances of a policeman being on the right corner at the right time are probably less than the same officer being struck by lightning.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there is plenty that we can do, and urgently.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">First we need to be clear about who is dying and who is doing the killing, and we must be honest that there is a racial component to the violence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The deaths are taking place in the urban semi-ghettos of London, Manchester and other big cities, especially those which have become home to refugees from war zones in Eastern Europe, Africa and elsewhere. Many of these young people have grown up with the extreme violence of modern warfare – rape, beheadings, executions – and are traumatised in a way that is a danger to them and to others unless it is treated.</p><img id="i-5b93001bbe4ad01d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/08/17/5940978-6365545-image-a-1_1541696465520.jpg" height="526" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Membership of a gang brings protection and a sense of belonging and the promise of a slice of the profits of the illegal drugs trade.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So the forlorn attempts by politicians and media to ignore this truth – to avoid ‘stigmatising’ minority communities – has been counterproductive, a hand-wringing dereliction of responsibility. It might make ‘right-on’ white liberals feel better. But the price of their smugness is an ongoing bloody massacre of black children with a casualty list that seems to lengthen by the day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To tackle it, we urgently need a combination of sticks and carrots – the first to stem the tide of death, the second to radically change the conditions in which the violence grows.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We need to stop the blood flowing by following the example of the American police and identifying the high-risk zones, based on data from police, hospitals and schools. Police should be empowered to flood these areas, using stop-and-search powers as freely as they wish. Indeed, they should be empowered with new laws similar to anti-terror legislation that allows detention of the gang leaders who may not wield the knives but give the orders.</p><img id="i-d8ce0219dfda6cd0" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/11/01/5949376-0-16_year_old_John_Ogunjobi_who_died_after_being_stabbed_in_Tulse_-a-72_1541900821497.jpg" height="1127" width="634" alt="16-year-old John Ogunjobi who died after being stabbed in Tulse Hill, south London, on Bonfire night" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the head of the Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, is right and hi-tech tools will boost detection rates, then fretting about privacy from people whose families are in no danger should be ignored. In areas where the gangs are primarily black or from another ethnic group, police might even be permitted to apply for exemption from race discrimination laws for a limited period. This could free their hands to act against specific targets – and few would be more pleased than minority parents who constantly worry that their children may never come home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To protect people’s rights, every officer should be fitted with a body-worn camera, which should ensure that such operations are carried out fairly and with respect.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the same time, we need to disrupt the supply of fresh youngsters entering the cycle of death. Instead of spending yet more energy and cash on pointless campaigns against social media ‘hate crimes’, we should offer families at risk new homes outside the area.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An imaginative education department might consider funding the schooling of bright young boys or girls in danger of joining a gang at a boarding school far from the estate where they grew up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s no accident that Tottenham MP David Lammy, who grew up next to the notorious Broadwater Farm estate, got to university with the help of a music scholarship to a school outside London.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There must be a range of ‘carrots’ or incentives, also. Why not offer young professionals a good reason to live in the areas where the gangs operate. It has been shown in America that changing the ethnic and social mix significantly reduces the presence of drug dealers and pimps, and undermines the grip of gang culture on the streets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We could offer a long council tax ‘holiday’ to people moving into a high-risk zone, coupled with some strong regulation to stop mortgage companies refusing to operate in the areas at risk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prisons are another front line in this war, places where the gangs consolidate their control over captive young men. Currently, the authorities appear powerless to prevent the murderous conflict we see on the streets playing out behind bars also. Prison governors need fresh powers to ship out key gang members, whether black, white, Pakistani Muslim or godless Eastern European.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And in the end, we need to persuade young men that this isn’t a normal way of life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Right now, few employers will take the risk of hiring someone with a conviction.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are exceptions, including John Timpson, owner of the Timpson shoe repair shops, and London businessman Iqbal Wahhab, who has mentored several former gang members to business success. Their example must be followed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Above all we must name the problem for what it is, if we are to stem this vicious tide. Hand-wringing helps no one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We are already too late for the family of Beniamin Pieknyi.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Former Equality Commission chairman TREVOR PHILLIPS says that violence is taking place in the urban semi-ghettos of London, Manchester and other big cities, especially those which have become home to refugees from war zones in Eastern Europe, Africa and elsewhere.

But they essentially involve rejection of calls for a rigid and unilateral process for exiting the so-called ‘back-stop’ in the event the final details of a new customs arrangement take time to be hammered out. ‘The problems with any deal other than Chequers remain,’ a May ally says uncompromisingly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She is right not to compromise. The time for obsessing over the arcane minutiae of Brexit is over. Unless a deal is concluded, in a week’s time, Britain will move on to a war footing. Contingency plans will be activated to ensure transportation and warehousing of emergency food, medicine and other supplies to the UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No fewer than eight separate Cobra national resilience protocols are set to be activated, including plans to deal with blackouts, petrol shortages and even the collapse of the UK’s satellite navigation systems. Real-life is about to shoulder aside the impenetrable debates over the back-stops – and the back-stops to the back-stops.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May, for all her faults, grasps this reality. Yes, during the course of the Brexit negotiations, she has made mistakes. She has been excessively aloof. ‘It’s a running joke that there’s no point trying to get a one-on-one meeting with her,’ a Minister told me. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Communication with ‘the Sherpas’, her officials co-ordinating the talks in Brussels, has been poor, leading to her humiliating ambush in Salzburg. Moments of clarity and determination have been interspersed with instances of indecision and paralysis. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But she has, in her awkward, dogged way, demonstrated leadership. Despite the volleys of shot and shell, from Left and Right, she has broadly stuck to her course. To the extent that her well-documented political isolation now stands as – an albeit unwelcome – testament to her singularity of purpose.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s time for that isolation to end. Those Ministers and MPs who are this weekend mulling over ‘doing a Johnson’ and walking away need to ask themselves a simple question. What else? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What do they honestly see are the alternatives to the deal the Prime Minister is trying to inelegantly wrangle past her fractious Cabinet, increasingly duplicitous EU negotiating partners and divided House of Commons?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No one can seriously entertain the idea of removing Mrs May at this stage of negotiations and replacing her with a new Prime Minister. The EU would think – correctly – they were dealing with a banana republic, not a mature Western democracy, and respond accordingly. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Which leaves three alternatives to May’s Brexit. One is a No Deal Brexit. People can scream ‘Project Fear’ all they like but I have spoken to Ministers who served in the trenches on behalf of the Leave campaign during the referendum. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not effete Remoaners, but stout-hearted Brexiteers. And they are terrified. Terrified of the probable economic, social and political cost of a No Deal scenario.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there is a second alternative. Which is No Brexit. A new referendum is no longer merely a wicked glint in Peter Mandleson’s eye. As Jo Johnson’s resignation demonstrated, the idea is gaining traction across the political spectrum. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, in the event of a rejection of May’s deal, and the plunge into parliamentary procedural purgatory that could easily follow, it would become the only way of breaking the deadlock.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Save for one. Which is a Corbynite Red Brexit. If a deal is rejected, and a referendum is too politically unpalatable, then the only alternative is a General Election. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An Election characterised by a Conservative Party tearing itself to pieces, Tory activists decrying the great Brexit sell-out and Ministers forlornly imploring voters: ‘Better us than the chaos of Labour. Surely?’ Corbyn wouldn’t need to leave his allotment to secure a landslide.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A Downing Street source told me yesterday, with a mastery of understatement: ‘The deal isn’t going to be perfect.’ But the reality is the voters are not expecting perfection. What they crave now is resolution. </p><img id="i-1d2c345344f55ffc" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/11/01/6033930-0-image-m-68_1541900039913.jpg" height="648" width="634" alt="As Jo Johnson’s resignation demonstrated, the idea of new referendum that could put a stop to Brexit is no longer merely a wicked glint in Peter Mandleson’s eye and is gaining traction across the political spectrum" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Both Leavers and Remainers claim to have the ear of the people. ‘No betrayal!’ bellows out across the watering holes frequented by the Brexiteers. ‘Think again!’ echoes around the gilded parlours of the Remoaners. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet strangely, none seem to hear the real voice of Britain.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">What do you think about during the two minutes silence? I used to think of men at war, and hear in my head the shouts and the clash of arms. Now I see a narrow street of small houses at dusk. A young man in army uniform is embracing his wife and little children in a lighted doorway. He will not return.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I recently learned that, on the first day of commemoration, in 1919, the silence was often far from silent. In many places, when the traffic and the factories stopped, the sound of uncontrollable weeping could be heard in many towns.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nearly three quarters of a million young men had died far away. In an age when death was still marked by elaborate rituals of mourning, they’d had no funerals. For the first time, the bereaved had an opportunity to grieve properly.</p><img id="i-b3ac65e8923d52fb" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/11/01/6033916-0-image-a-67_1541900318507.jpg" height="415" width="634" alt="Prime Minister Theresa May, right, and French President Emmanuel Macron, left, walk together after laying wreaths at the World War I Thiepval Memorial in Thiepval, France" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">This commemoration is above all about the First World War, which has just ceased to be a warm, living memory and become the cold untouchable past. As a child I knew and talked to people who had lived through it, who had seen Zeppelins caught in the searchlights. In my teenage years, the Great War was as close to us as the 1960s are now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I knew, when I first learned about it, that the 1914 war was a chasm between us and another world.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I rather liked the look of the world that had been lost – calmer, slower, more solid than ours. I had a feeling we were now a smaller people than we had been, scuttling about in the ruins of a lost civilisation.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has also struck me, since I am so often told that those who fought in 1914 did so for our freedom, that we are far less free as a people, from all kinds of government interference, than we were before that war. It was 1914 that began the era of heavy taxation, surveillance, regulation and general snooping and bureaucracy which now stifle us.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was also 1914 that swept away the restrained and quiet world of yesterday, and the great, stuffy cumbersome empires of Austria, Germany and Russia, replacing them with the slick murderous modern empires of the Nazis and the Bolsheviks. Was this progress? Give me the Kaiser and the Tsar, any day, rather than Hitler and Stalin. I used to think the 1914 war was terrible but necessary, and now I know too much history to believe this any more. If we were trying to prevent German domination of Europe, we failed, for here they still are, dominating away, through the medium of the EU.</p><div class="item">

He’s hopelessly wrong about Russia, which he has mixed up with the USSR. I think the Government are exploiting him by appointing him as an adviser on housing. They will politely hear out his arguments in favour of building beautiful things, and then concrete over the countryside with ugly box homes anyway.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the attempt, by Left-wing fanatics, to get the Prime Minister to sack him, is actually shameful.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sir Roger’s views, similar to mine, are unfashionable.

It is not remotely anti-Semitic, and nor is he – unlike the unpleasant author Roald Dahl, whose seething, repulsive Judophobia has long been overlooked because his works bring in lots of money to publishers and film-makers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The worst part of this attack on Sir Roger is this. Not long ago, at some peril to himself, he was one of a small, brave band of men and women who went into the dark lands of Eastern Europe in the days of Communist repression. They set up secret schools of free thought, where Sir Roger taught. They smuggled aid in various forms to courageous dissidents who were silenced by Left-wing censorship and secret police.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, by a twist he can never have expected, he is himself a dissident in a country that was once free. And foolish, nasty people snap at his heels, smear him and would like to see him silenced.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We don’t have secret police here quite yet.

I used to think of men at war, and hear in my head the shouts and the clash of arms. Now I see a narrow street of small houses at dusk. A young man in army uniform is embracing his wife and little children in a lighted doorway. He will not return. I recently learned that, on the first day of commemoration, in 1919, the silence was often far from silent. In many places, when the traffic and the factories stopped, the sound of uncontrollable weeping could be heard in many towns. Nearly three quarters of a million young men had died far away. In an age when death was still marked by elaborate rituals of mourning, they’d had no funerals. For the first time, the bereaved had an opportunity to grieve properly.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Peter Hitchens for The Mail on Sunday</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-11-11T09:50:48.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>PETER HITCHENS: Soldiers?

Millions will watch as The Queen attends the Remembrance Day service, and leaders of the combatant nations will join each other in declaring ‘never again’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet at the last significant anniversary, in 1968, 50 years since the Armistice, the Queen and Prince Philip weren’t even in the country. They were in Rio de Janeiro and it was left to the Duke of Kent to lay a wreath at the Cenotaph.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then, there was a widespread feeling that it was time to call an end to the ceaseless commemoration, and instead to embrace the present and the future.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On this 100th anniversary, however, there seems to be a genuine popular desire to reimagine the horrors of that particularly horrible war. Why not follow the instincts of decades ago and allow it just to become history? After all, those who wore British uniforms and survived to the Armistice have now succumbed to natural causes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The timing is part of it, perhaps. While Remembrance Sunday happens every year, today it falls on the 11th day of the 11th month. One hundred years ago today, at 11am, the blood-letting stopped.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is more to it than an accident of timing, though. Britain has been walking backwards into the future for decades, revelling in long-gone glories on our way to car-boot sales or over spoonfuls of instant food eaten on self-assembly furniture. But this anniversary is more than the recollection of past glories (for whatever else it was, the Great War was not glorious).</p><div class="item">

Britain in 2018 is a country that feels let down by our politicians and lied to by our media, while the custody of the Western world is in the hands of the most unattractive man to hold the office since it was first invented.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remoaners claim that the vote to leave the European Union was an incoherent howl of ‘nothing can be worse than this.’ The country didn’t, they assert, know what it wanted, but it sure as hell didn’t like what it had.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is a patronising insult to anyone voting to leave the European Union to regain control of national destiny. A sense of purpose matters, whether that’s for an individual or for a nation, and a sense of purpose is what so many of us will be reflecting on today.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How different was the Britain of the First World War, when millions of men and women came together and ‘did their bit’. Look at the photographs of the jolly young Tommies marching off to war and the female tram drivers, munitions workers and Land Army girls, also cheery for the camera: the nation they represent smiled in the face of hardship.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No one in their right mind would claim that pre-war Britain – where the women and most of those doing the dying couldn’t vote – was better than today. The quality of life was far worse. But the faces in these photographs are those of citizens answering what they felt to be a national call.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By the time of the Armistice, a staggering five million were wearing British military uniforms. But Britain is no longer a country where unanimity prevails. </p><div class="item">

That it didn’t turn out to be anything of the kind was not the fault of those who died but of politicians.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is not as if we had been forced into hostilities. There was no imminent threat to this country. The immediate casus belli was the German invasion of Belgium, which Britain had promised to protect way back in 1839.</p><img id="i-3f6bd9a020be9430" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/11/01/6033470-0-image-a-44_1541898780149.jpg" height="391" width="634" alt="Prime Minister Theresa May lays a wreath watched by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel (L) at the cemetery at St. Symphorien, which was established by the German Army in August 1914 as the final resting place for British and German soldiers who were killed in the Battle of Mons" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Belgium is an inherently incoherent country, which is, of course why it now so jealously protects its role as seat of the supra-national European Union. But commitments are commitments, and the British Government could not hope to be taken seriously in the world if it ignored the country’s desperate pleas.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Lloyd George was asked how he had got on at the treaty talks which followed the Armistice, he is supposed to have replied ‘Not badly, considering I was seated between Jesus Christ and Napoleon.’ </p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Christ was the US president, Woodrow Wilson, a zealot who thought he could reshape the world, ‘Napoleon’ was the walrus-moustached French prime minister, Georges Clemenceau.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is France’s curse to keep knitting one macramé Napoleon after another. The latest, Emanuel Macron, will lead his nation’s remembrance ceremonies and has said that the First World War memorials remind him of how important the EU is in obstructing European nationalisms. </p><img id="i-584ab6847816a751" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/11/18/6033394-6376229-When_George_Orwell_looked_back_at_the_war_he_thought_that_the_av-a-1_1541960248425.jpg" height="620" width="634" alt="When George Orwell looked back at the war, he thought that the average British soldier had emerged from it with contempt for French civilians and a sneaking respect for the German soldier" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">We can expect more of the same.

The British ruling class has been trying to make us love the French for generations, when in fact we have very little in common with them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We should never forget that the purpose of Remembrance Sunday is to honour the dead. All politicians need projects. But let us be wary of grand schemes. We should recall the extent to which respect for our ancestors is inextricably mixed up with how we feel about our country. Let’s get the relationship between individual sacrifice and national purpose right.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Courage is hard. Speeches are easy to make.

They meant it literally: a statement of ringing idealism, a dream of a better world.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their hopes did not last long. Even on the first anniversary of the Armistice, in 1919, it was grimly obvious that the Great War had not ended all wars at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For, although the guns had fallen silent, they did not stay silent for long.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Far from ushering in a new age of peace, the end of World War I was followed by vicious civil wars in Ireland and Hungary, an interminable series of wars in Central and Eastern Europe and the deaths of at least ten million people in the Russian Civil War.</p><img id="i-10ad7a24672eb2f6" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/10/01/6004842-0-image-a-24_1541813387596.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="French President Emmanuel Macron (C) sits next to French historian Antoine Prost (L) as he attends a round table with historians on the Great War in Peronne on November 9, 2018 - Macron is currently on a six-day tour to visit the most iconic landmarks of the First World War (WWI) ahead of the celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the 11 November 1918 armistice" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even for the British Army, the Armistice was only a comma, not a full stop. In the next two years, thousands of men saw action in Russia, Afghanistan, Turkey, Kuwait, Ireland and Iraq, battlegrounds that might have been ripped from today’s news headlines.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Right from the start, therefore, there was a tragic irony in the act of remembrance. Even as millions bowed their heads, the world was sliding towards a second world war that would prove even more horrific than the first.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even today, the end of World War I is hardly a cause for uncomplicated celebration. A century on, we are still living with its aftershocks, especially in the blood-drenched shatter zones where the defeated empires of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Turkey gave way to a mosaic of bitterly competitive new nation states.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Syria’s civil war, for example, reflects ethnic and religious tensions that date back to Syria’s creation by the Allies after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1918.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Similarly, the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, which has poisoned world politics for so long, can be traced back to Britain’s attempt to win a propaganda victory by promising a Jewish homeland in Ottoman Palestine.</p><img id="i-ec3ac3995441e2f7" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/10/01/6004872-0-image-a-29_1541813516524.jpg" height="410" width="634" alt="German Chancellor Angela Merkel (L) speaks to Russia's President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Istanbul last month" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, although Remembrance Day sermons often urge us to make sure that it ‘never happens again’, the fact is that it is happening again — right now, today, in the ravaged cities of eastern Ukraine, the apocalyptic nightmares of Syria and Yemen and the interminable bloodbaths of Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, as frightening as this may sound, a major continental war will almost certainly happen again one day, not least because it would be naive to pretend that the forces that fuelled the war in 1914 have vanished for ever.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps the most obvious is the role of Germany. As it happens, I am not one of those historians who think the Germans deserve all the blame for the outbreak of war in 1914.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet if there was one thing that destabilised the balance of power in Europe before 1914, it was the emergence of Germany as a single entity, an economic and military leviathan that was simply too big for its own continent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Does that sound familiar? It should. For in many respects, the story of Europe during the past decade has been the struggle to manage Germany’s immense economic and political power.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, Angela Merkel has never espoused Kaiser Wilhelm II’s militaristic ambitions. But, at a time when the far-Right AfD are polling in double figures there, and would be the obvious beneficiaries from an economic downturn, it is hard not to worry about Germany’s future path. And even if the far Right never comes to power, the German problem will not go away. Such is its economic hegemony that the governments of Greece, Spain and Portugal have sacrificed the prosperity of their own people in order to stay inside the German-dominated European project, stoking resentments for what could be decades to come. But power inevitably provokes a reaction.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can see it not just in the anti-German graffiti on the streets of Athens, but in the rhetoric of demagogues such as Hungary’s Viktor Orban, who is never happier than when he is denouncing Brussels and Berlin.</p><img id="i-b2fd40ff1f05f43b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/10/01/6004848-0-image-a-25_1541813462158.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="US President Donald J.

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">It is no coincidence that Mr Orban looks for support to Germany’s great rival in 1914, the brooding, resentful giant of Russia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, for another example of the continuities between the 1910s and the 2010s, just look at Russia’s ambitions in Eastern Europe, from its attempts to destabilise pro-Western forces in Montenegro and Macedonia to its cyber-warfare campaigns in Latvia and Estonia. Because we remain so fixated on the Western Front, we often forget the incendiary role the Russians played in the outbreak of World War I. For it was they who ignited the superpower conflict when they insisted on backing Serbia after the assassination of Austria-Hungary’s Archduke Franz Ferdinand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why did the Russians do it? Why support a terrorist state so far from their own borders, even when they knew it might provoke a global conflagration?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The answer is that they were desperate to promote their interests in the Balkans, feared the advance of their wealthier Western rivals and were determined to protect what they saw as their own sphere of influence. Does that, too, sound familiar?</p><img id="i-ee4e5fe10220789c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/10/16/6004858-6374093-British_Prime_Minister_Theresa_May_right_and_French_President_Em-a-101_1541867129906.jpg" height="415" width="634" alt="British Prime Minister Theresa May, right, and French President Emmanuel Macron, left, walk together after laying wreaths at the World War I Thiepval Memorial in Thiepval, France, Friday, Nov. 9, 2018.

But Mr Putin is not just an imperialist.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He has tapped the uniquely inflammatory power of nationalism, which was driven by the rise in literacy in the decades before 1914, and is fuelled by social media such as Facebook and Twitter today.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even a few years ago, commentators were talking of nationalism as something that belonged to history.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">National identity was supposed to be a thing of the past, superseded by a new multiculturalism. And the nation state was supposed to be on the way out, rendered obsolete by supranational entities like the EU. Few people would make such claims today. Far from undermining existing identities, globalisation and immigration have driven people back to the tribal loyalties of old.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The past two weeks alone have produced two conspicuous examples: first in Brazil, where the far-Right Jair Bolsonaro won power on a platform that might have been borrowed from the World War I veteran Benito Mussolini; and then in the United States, where Donald Trump’s unrepentantly nationalist appeal — ‘America First’ — attracted tens of millions of voters in the mid-term elections.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the most glaring examples have come in precisely the places most affected by World War I, where a sense of festering resentment, victimhood and betrayal has been passed down the generations.</p><img id="i-86673722cc5729b3" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/10/01/6004916-0-image-a-30_1541813626966.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May (L), Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel (R), and Liz Sweet, Director of External Relations at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, walk through the St Symphorien Military Cemetery in Mons, Belgium.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">It is no coincidence, I think, that the EU’s most aggressively xenophobic leader, the demagogic Viktor Orban, came to power in Hungary, a country that was occupied and humiliated by its neighbours after 1918 and lost more than two-thirds of its territory and half its population in the post-war settlement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nor is it a coincidence that the authoritarian Recep Tayyip Erdogan rose to power in Turkey, a country that lost a huge transcontinental empire during the war, was occupied by the Allies and almost dismembered by the Greeks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps the most disturbing example, though, comes in the very place where the centenary of the Armistice will be commemorated this afternoon: France.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite its rhetorical commitment to European unity, France is a country where the fires of nationalism still burn brightly.</p><div>

Indeed, the two departements she won in 2017, Aisne and Pas-de-Calais, saw some of the bitterest fighting of the war, including the battles of Arras, Loos and Vimy Ridge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This week, nationwide opinion polls actually put her National Rally ahead of Mr Macron’s party for the first time — a startling and disturbing development.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps the French president should spend less time commemorating the battles of the past, then, and more time worrying about the battles of the future.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For if France follows countries such as Italy and Hungary in embracing the politics of nationalism, a conflict in Europe will no longer look so fantastical.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">None of this, of course, means that we could see a re-run of World War I.

It was, he continued, 'a failure of British statecraft on a scale unseen since the Suez crisis'. Sound familiar?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Less than a month ago, Boris was urging the PM to make a tougher stand on the Northern Ireland 'backstop' issue, saying: 'If we let this go it will be the greatest national humiliation since Suez.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Similarly, last year Boris said that if Britain left but remained in close continued alignment with EU rules, 'people would ask 'what is the point of what you have achieved?' because we would have gone from a member state to a vassal state'. The similarities in their language are all the more extraordinary given that the brothers are firmly entrenched on opposite sides of the Brexit debate.</p><img id="i-42d00b77694fe21d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/09/23/6002364-6373891-image-m-5_1541806871154.jpg" height="556" width="306" alt="There was nothing pale about the full-blooded assault Jo launched on the Prime Minister yesterday" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jo Johnson, 46, who stood down as transport minister, is the paid-up member of the Michael Heseltine Europhile wing of the Tory party who wants to kill Brexit, hence his call for a second referendum.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Boris, 54, who quit the Cabinet in July over the PM's Chequers proposals, is the standard bearer of the hardline Brexiteers who wants to make the cleanest possible break from Brussels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, they are united in a common cause on the back benches because, as their sister, journalist Rachel Johnson, said last night, 'neither of them want the Brexit on offer'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Boris lost no time tweeting his support yesterday, but the question is: will they put the fierce Johnson competitiveness and the personal ambition they both harbour to one side to work together, and what will it mean for Mrs May if they do? They have always been close despite a childhood that, according to Boris's biographer Andrew Gimson, was one of 'cut-throat meal-time quizzes, fearsome ping-pong matches, height, weight and blondeness contests'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To many – and not least himself – it has always seemed that it was Boris's destiny to one day move into Downing Street. But it was Jo, elected as the MP for Orpington in 2010 after a career as a journalist, who became the first Johnson to take up residence in N0 10 as head of the Downing Street Policy Unit. Boris had to make do with City Hall as Mayor of London.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jo had been the surprise choice of David Cameron to head the unit in 2013 and Johnson 'Minor', as he was known after following in Boris's footsteps at Eton, revelled in getting one over his big brother. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It wasn't the first time Boris had been left eyeing Jo a little jealously. He had graduated from Oxford with a first-class degree in modern history, while Boris had only managed a 2:1 in classics. Jo then acquired two further degrees from European universities.</p><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">For the past two years, <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/brexit/index.html" id="mol-a46469e0-e479-11e8-b6bc-2b4af0b95880">Brexit</a> has advanced at a snail’s pace. There have been frequent reports that negotiations had broken down, and that <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/theresa_may/index.html" id="mol-a4641bc0-e479-11e8-b6bc-2b4af0b95880">Theresa May</a> was finished.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I never gave them any credence. The truth, as I have reported regularly in this column, is that talks have advanced much more smoothly than was widely understood.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hundreds of civil servants — the unsung heroes of the Brexit process — on both sides of the Channel have quietly been working to negotiate an outcome which they hope will succeed, both for Britain and Europe.</p><img id="i-508b8e57747b03f8" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/09/23/6001996-0-image-a-3_1541806594438.jpg" height="414" width="634" alt="Owen Paterson, David Trimble and Iain Duncan Smith leave a meeting with European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels last month" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Next week, maybe on Tuesday, Theresa May will almost certainly come to the House of Commons to announce that the deal has been agreed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In all essentials the deal already exists. That’s why the Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, has been asked to give his legal opinion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And this weekend Cabinet ministers are being rung up by Downing Street and bribed or strong-armed into agreement. Some may walk. We should brace ourselves for the possibility of more Cabinet resignations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Next week may, therefore, mark a key moment in Britain’s post-war history. Barring some last-minute hiccup, the first details of Britain’s post-Brexit arrangement with Europe will be published.</p><img id="i-ccff5d93da9c7903" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/09/23/6002038-0-image-a-2_1541806585362.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the European Council in Brussels in October last month" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Though I expect the Government to produce a long document, I understand that the essential outlines are simple enough to summarise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Britain will leave the European Union on March 29 next year. We will no longer be represented in the Brussels Commission or in the European Parliament.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, for the immediate future at least, we stay on as a member of the European customs union. Britain has also agreed to the controversial Northern Irish ‘backstop’. This means that we will remain as part of the customs arrangement — and therefore subject to European courts — until such time as a trading arrangement with Europe is agreed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps, and this is the fear of the Brexiteers, it is where we will remain for ever.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Such is the deal that Theresa May has fought for. It’s the deal which big business has argued for. She believes it will protect British jobs and prosperity. It should be seen as a personal triumph for the Prime Minister.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it’s also a deal which represents many thing those who sought a clean break from Europe fought against.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">So expect cries of betrayal. Not just from Nigel Farage, either. We should also expect an eruption in the Conservative Party.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not a minor eruption. It’ll be a first-class row that will potentially blow the Tories to bits. A modern Vesuvius. This means that the $64,000 question in British politics is no longer whether the deal can be agreed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It now becomes whether the deal can be forced through Parliament. Anybody who claims they know the answer is a liar.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is certain that a number of Brexiteers will be opposed. Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, has already made it plain that he regards Mrs May’s deal as a disaster for Britain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But then so does his brother Jo, who is on the other side of the Brexit divide: he resigned yesterday as a transport minister, saying we are ‘barrelling towards an incoherent Brexit’ and calling for another referendum. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He is a moderate, thoughtful loyalist, and there’s no doubt his departure is a major blow to Downing Street.</p><img id="i-761d4f9e4a9ea352" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/09/23/6002210-0-image-a-1_1541806487052.jpg" height="431" width="634" alt="Nigel Farage pictured with Brexit backer Arron Banks. Peter Oborne warns to expect cries of betrayal. He writes: 'Not just from Nigel Farage, either.

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">David Davis, meanwhile, the former Brexit negotiator who thinks the PM’s gone soft on Europe, says he will vote against the deal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Brexiteers will argue — and there is no doubt they have a reasonable point — that Mrs May’s deal represents a betrayal of her own Lancaster House speech two years ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back then, she set out an image of Brexit Britain taking back control of our own borders, our own laws, immigration and trade.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That’s incompatible with the continued membership of the customs union that Mrs May will announce next week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And that perceived betrayal may cost the Prime Minister her job in Downing Street. Because for many Tories, Brexit is an issue of far greater importance than ordinary party politics. There is now a genuine possibility that some of them will team up with Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party and vote down Mrs May’s Brexit deal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those who think it implausible that diehard Tories such as Owen Paterson and Iain Duncan Smith could join up with Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell to destroy Theresa May should think again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Such alliances of opposites have occurred before.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Potentially, the Corbynites and Brexiteers will be joined by the Democratic Unionist Party, who say they are in despair at Mrs May’s so-called backstop arrangement.</p><img id="i-b82f3f2e1a9f17e3" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/09/23/6002378-0-image-a-6_1541806792942.jpg" height="419" width="634" alt="In her Lancaster House speech, May set out an image of Brexit Britain taking back control of our own borders, our own laws, immigration and trade.

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Though the future is impossible to predict, one thing is certain. The nearly two years of phoney war after the 2016 Brexit referendum are over. We have now left the long period of political stasis, and instead events will move with bewildering speed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have advice for those without strong stomachs and nerves of iron: get off the train now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As I see it, the timetable goes as follows. Next week, the Prime Minister will announce her Brexit deal to the House of Commons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She will then arrange a special Brexit summit, in order formally to sign off her deal with European trade negotiator Michel Barnier at the end of this month. November 25 is the date I am hearing. Parliament will then vote on the deal in early December.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If Mrs May wins her vote, all well and good. HMS Great Britain will sail relatively serenely towards the exit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If Mrs May loses the vote, however, there will be a rush for the lifeboats. We will be plunged into a constitutional crisis on a scale we have not seen for decades.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Will the Prime Minister have to resign if she can’t command a Commons majority? Some say no. But I believe she will have no choice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As to what happens if that comes to pass, opinions differ. Some Tory powerbrokers are plotting to survive in government by holding a leadership election. This sounds plain daft to me.</p><img id="i-2e8a3d438478656c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/09/23/6002372-0-image-a-5_1541806789718.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="DUP leader Arlene Foster (right) and deputy leader Nigel Dodds speaking to the media in the Great Hall at Stormont, Belfast earlier this week.

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Many voters would wonder how the Conservatives dared to change leader at such a pivotal moment for the nation. In such circumstances, I believe an event which happens only very rarely in modern politics will take place. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The monarch will be forced, however reluctantly, to intervene. Fulfilling her constitutional role means the Queen — who is far more respected than any living British politician — will invite Jeremy Corbyn to try his hand at forming a government.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I doubt he will be able to do so, at which point a number of different options will be considered.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One will be another general election. It’s also likely that calls for a second referendum on Brexit would then gain strength.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s less than eight weeks until Christmas Day, and I’m not going too far to say that the destiny of Britain for the next half-century could be determined amid the carol services and sparkling trees of the festive season.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If I was a betting man, I would guess Mrs May will get her way and, for all the travails she has faced in recent months, she will yet lead Britain out of the European Union on March 29.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Bercow shames Parliament.

Bercow’s role ought to be to stand above politics and ensure fairness for all sides. Sadly, he makes no secret of his sympathies for Remain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is a disaster.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Before I write another word, I should caution that I will be straying a long way from my habitual territory this week to touch upon matters sexual.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those who prefer more salubrious reading material at the breakfast table should turn the page now. As for any who choose to stick with me, well, don’t say you haven’t been warned.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I blame Jess Phillips MP (of whom more in a moment). Anyway, here goes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Getting on for 50 years ago, as a smutty-minded schoolboy of 17, I sent a newspaper cutting to the satirical magazine, Private Eye, in the hope of being paid for having spotted it.</p><img id="i-e14b2f40034978a4" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/09/01/5960140-0-image-a-1_1541725553513.jpg" height="951" width="634" alt="Labour MP Jess Phillips has said that girls should be taught about orgasms during sex education lessons at school" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the time, I thought it one of the funniest things anyone could hope to read — and I blush to realise that, to this day, I remember it word for word.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The year was 1971 and controversy was raging in the media over an explicit sex education film, Growing Up, made for use in schools by a so-called sexologist, Dr Martin Cole. Traditionalists who believed the sexual revolution of the Sixties had already gone too far were up in arms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They included the formidable clean-up TV campaigner Mary Whitehouse and her co-founders of the Nationwide Festival Of Light anti-pornography pressure group, Lord Longford and the journalist Malcolm Muggeridge. How we mocked them, we sophisticated metropolitan schoolboys who thought we knew it all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Caution</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The then-Education Secretary, an obscure politician called Margaret Thatcher, told the Commons she was ‘very perturbed’ at the thought of the film being shown in schools and advised local education authorities to consider it ‘with extreme caution’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cue a newspaper report of a lecture given by Dr Cole to schoolchildren, during which his film was screened.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The account contained the following lines, which struck the teenaged me as hilarious: ‘A 15-year-old girl said she found Dr Cole’s lecture very interesting, but the only thing in it that she hadn’t heard about before was masturbation. About 50 members of the Festival Of Light anti-pornography league demonstrated outside the hall.’</p><img id="i-3ab528fd902d6e37" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/09/01/5960224-0-image-a-2_1541725735661.jpg" height="352" width="634" alt="Women¿s expectations ¿should be greater¿, said Mrs Phillips, a 37-year-old mother of two. They should start ¿demanding more¿ during sex" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">For reasons that mystified me, Private Eye chose not to print my contribution. Had the editor failed to pick up the double entendre in the word ‘demonstrated’? Or did he just think it too unfunny, or too tasteless, to defile the pages of his magazine?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anyway, I was reminded this week of my puerile failed attempt to earn a fiver from Private Eye when I read Labour MP Mrs Phillips’s demand that girls should be taught about orgasms during sex education lessons at school.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her remarks were apparently prompted by a Kinsey Institute study, which found that only 65 per cent of heterosexual women ‘usually or always’ climax during sex, compared with 95 per cent of men.Here was yet more evidence of cruel sexual inequality, suffered by women in our wickedly patriarchal society.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Women’s expectations ‘should be greater’, declared Mrs Phillips, a 37-year-old mother of two, who will be familiar to viewers of the BBC’s Have I Got News For You. They should start ‘demanding more’ during sex.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I’m not suggesting we teach children how to masturbate,’ she said. ‘I’m suggesting we talk to them about the things they’re doing anyway.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m not entirely sure what she meant by that, or quite what form she thought these orgasm lessons should take. But it was clear that her intention was to open up a new battlefront in the feminist war for equality with members of my sex.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I pictured mass rallies in Parliament Square, thronged with protesters holding placards demanding ‘A Woman’s Right To Sexual Fulfilment’. Before long, the Government would be cowed into action, perhaps sending inspectors into the nation’s bedrooms to advise us on where we’ve been going wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Eccentric</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After all, to a Labour MP there is no inequality too intractable to be remedied by state intervention — and no human activity too private to be shielded from Big Brother’s all-seeing eyes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Two thoughts immediately sprang to my mind. The first was that, these days, Mrs Phillips would be hard pushed to find a 15-year-old, of either sex, who had never heard of masturbation. Heaven knows, there were few enough around even in 1971, before Dr Cole and his followers made it their eccentric mission to tell girls and boys all about it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Though I may be wrong, I suspect a substantial majority of today’s teenagers have seen it demonstrated (if I may use that word again) in all-too-graphic detail on the internet. Their generation must be the best informed in history on what we might call the mechanics of sex.</p><img id="i-f3e8926e75973e1" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/09/01/5960240-0-image-a-3_1541725775914.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Tom Utley suspects that a substantial majority of today¿s teenagers might be the best informed in history on what we might call the mechanics of sex - thanks to the internet " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">My second thought was that if lessons were really needed on how heterosexual women could achieve satisfaction, they would surely be better directed at boys than at girls. I cannot stress too strongly that I claim no expertise in this area. But if I had to guess, I would suggest that all this aggressive hammering away on the internet, accompanied by yelps of ecstasy, might be misleading to the young lads of today. They might find a little tenderness would sometimes be more appreciated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, as feminists now admit, Mrs Whitehouse and Co had it right when they argued that pornography and the modern world’s obsession with sex do a grave disservice to women.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But then what do I know? Born in 1953, I missed out on the sort of lessons pioneered by Dr Cole, with all the visual and audio aids schools now use to help pupils understand the process of human reproduction and associated matters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, my entire formal sex education was confined to the five-minute ‘Leavers’ Talk’, delivered to a group of a dozen 13-year-olds by an acutely embarrassed headmaster at my prep school.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sniggers</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The awful thing was that we all knew exactly what he was going to say, because the Leavers’ Talk had been gleefully mimicked in the dorm by generations who had gone before us — complete with the nervous tics the poor man had suffered since his days as a prisoner of the Japanese during the war.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As he gave the talk, you could tell he would marginally have preferred to be back in that POW camp.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I am not going to tell you the facts of life, because you all know them already,’ he began, as we tried desperately not to catch each other’s eyes, for fear of bursting into uncontrollable sniggers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No, he just wanted to warn us about a ‘dreadful crime’ we might encounter at our public schools.</p><div>

He left the rest to our imagination.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And that was that — the beginning and end of my formal sex education.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, I can’t remember where, when or how I learned the facts of life. My parents certainly didn’t pass them on to me, and I’ve often thanked God that our four boys never asked me how babies were made (I was going to tell them, gently but firmly: ‘Ask your mother’).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the boys’ very existence suggests I must have picked up the basics somewhere along the line — from a whispered word behind the school pavilion, perhaps, or a well-thumbed page in Encyclopedia Britannica. Like generations before me, I knew how it was done from a very early age without needing official guidance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for Mrs Phillips’s demand for orgasm lessons, I fear this is one battle for equality between the sexes she may never win.

For lucky <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/rio-ferdinand/index.html" id="mol-dfa33bd0-e3b6-11e8-b58f-cd94a90c29d5">Rio Ferdinand</a>, it has meant a new bride and a second chance at happiness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Three years after his wife, Rebecca, died of cancer, the former footballer is to marry his girlfriend, Kate Wright. He proposed to her in front of his children on a rooftop during a holiday in Abu Dhabi. Everyone is apparently thrilled.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘You can’t even remember what it’s like to feel happy. And then, bam, out of the blue, you meet someone and everything changes,’ loved-up Rio told his biographer, the journalist Decca Aitkenhead.</p><img id="i-424c975e174d8e95" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/09/00/5958266-6370033-image-m-14_1541722106832.jpg" height="487" width="634" alt="Kate Wright and Rio Ferdinand (pictured) recently announced their engagement after almost two years of dating. The former TOWIE star, 27, accepted a romantic rooftop proposal from the sports legend, 39, during a family holiday to Abu Dhabi" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a recent interview with The Sunday Times, he also encouraged her to follow in his footsteps and find love after suffering her own bereavement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘You need to get out there and meet someone too. Trust me — you’ll see what I mean,’ he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2014, Aitkenhead’s partner, Tony Wilkinson, drowned in Jamaica while trying to rescue their four-year-old son (who survived), leaving her a single mother of two young boys.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When she began contemplating her future without him, she initially worried she’d be romantically taken advantage of as a widow. Now, she wryly concludes that what wise friends told her nearly five years ago has turned out to be true.</p><img id="i-2a26accfa84918db" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/09/00/5958540-6370033-Three_years_ago_Rio_Ferdinand_s_wife_Rebecca_Ellison_died_of_can-a-1_1541724122776.jpg" height="478" width="306" alt="Three years ago, Rio Ferdinand's wife Rebecca Ellison died of cancer.

Look at Decca: attractive, intelligent, successful — and still single. Love after death certainly seems much easier to achieve for men.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A year after his wife, Gemma, died of cancer, and vowing that she would never be replaced, Sky Sports presenter Simon Thomas has just announced that he is in a relationship with a new girlfriend.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘From the early stages, she had this empathy towards me. She’s been an incredible support for me,’ he said, which tends to suggest their relationship has at least partly revolved around him and his grief.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not all men would be so empathetic if the circumstances were reversed. Some might say 12 months is far too early for a fresh romance, but Thomas has a young son and found the loneliness of widower-hood ‘brutal’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps one reason why men find new love more successfully than women is that they are less likely to have close friends they can talk to, or a social and emotional support network to help them through bereavement. Or perhaps they are just more selfish.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A recent study found two-thirds of widowers were in a new relationship within 25 months, in contrast to less than a fifth of widows. Over the age of 65, the discrepancy is even larger, with ten times as many widowers as widows remarrying.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But don’t worry, ladies, it’s not all doom and gloom.

Excuse my jest! For what else is there to do but cackle with dark humour when contemplating this sea of wifely despair? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But why is there such divergence between the sexes in love after death? The fragile male ego, Decca Aitkenhead is warned, cannot reconcile itself to the indignity of a relationship with a woman still in love with someone else.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most men don’t want to be the second choice or to feel inferior, whereas women find it easier to show a kind of deference to their predecessor, as they know it’s expected of them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They also know that men are hopeless by themselves, so they make themselves indispensable. They mould and adapt emotionally in ways men find more difficult.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And we cannot overlook the romantic allure of a widower with young children and the torrent of feelings, both maternal and carnal, that can arouse in a woman.</p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">According to the old saying, women mourn, men replace — and hopefully with a younger model, if the devils can possibly get away with it. Instead of forever dwelling on the past, many men aspire to repeat the happiness they knew as husbands, sometimes aided by women who see bereavement as opportunity, not tragedy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After his wife’s death, Rio Ferdinand talked often about risking a new relationship and revealed that, in the past, he had judged the bereaved harshly. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If a widower began dating within five years of losing his wife, it was Rio’s belief ‘he never really loved her’. Now he says that if a husband started dating the day after the funeral, he wouldn’t be appalled any more. He would understand. Who is anyone to judge? Most men and women would want their surviving spouses to be happy above all — to love and be loved in the years to come.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Captain Scott’s last letter to his wife, Kathleen, written as he faced certain death battling back from the South Pole in 1912, he urges her to remarry. ‘Dearest,’ he wrote, ‘you know I cherish no sentimental rubbish about remarriage — when the right man comes to help you in life, you ought to be your happy self again.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She did, in the end — but only ten long years after he perished on the ice.

For lucky Rio Ferdinand (pictured left with his fiancee Kate Wright), it has meant a new bride and a second chance at happiness. Three years after his wife, Rebecca (pictured inset left with Rio Ferdinand), died of cancer, the former footballer is to marry his girlfriend, Kate Wright. He proposed to her in front of his children on a rooftop during a holiday in Abu Dhabi. Everyone is apparently thrilled. A year after his wife, Gemma, died of cancer, and vowing that she would never be replaced, Sky Sports presenter Simon Thomas (right) has just announced that he is in a relationship with a new girlfriend.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Almost before the public announcement that the conservative philosopher Sir Roger Scruton had been made head of a new public body to champion beautiful buildings, the Left were on manoeuvres.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They began digging into his background and into his pronouncements over the years to try to unearth embarrassing material to block him from getting the job.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Left’s ‘archaeological dig’ in search of material that they could potentially label as offensive has echoes of the witch-hunt against another Right-winger who was appointed to a government post.</p><img id="i-e2f0047b604daf0f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/08/23/5955462-6369831-image-a-30_1541719045598.jpg" height="951" width="634" alt="Sir Roger Scruton, English philosopher, portrait at Aldeburgh Literary Festival, Aldeburgh, Suffolk" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Educationalist Toby Young, who founded the West London Free School, was forced to quit as a board member of the Government’s university regulator, the Office for Students, after his tasteless tweets about women made years earlier were unearthed by his detractors.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Scruton, 74, has been a thorn in the Left’s side for a great deal longer than Young. The high priest of the libertarian Right, he’s written 50 books and relishes controversy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Labour MPs and the Left’s lynch mob are therefore only too eager to denounce him after scouring the internet for his most controversial comments. They have claimed he is both anti-Semitic and Islamophobic as well as homophobic, citing as evidence selected quotes from his past writings that have been taken out of context.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For what it’s worth, as a gay man, I am not offended by his comment – made back in 2007 before gay marriage was introduced – that homosexuality was ‘not normal’. More importantly, though, I can’t see why it should disqualify him from opining on whether a building looks good or bad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the best part of 40 years Scruton, an accomplished musician and composer, has been a leading authority on aesthetics – which is why it is, in fact, a clever appointment. Now 74, he was brought up in Milton Keynes where his childhood was dominated by his father Jack’s depressive moods.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jack was a school teacher and ardent socialist as well as a harsh man who would not allow Roger or his two sisters to read Beatrix Potter books because they ‘polluted the image of the countryside with cosy bourgeois sentiment’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Roger got into High Wycombe Royal Grammar School, Jack disapproved because of his aversion to affectations of privilege.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His mother Beryl died of cancer when he was a teenager, but he won a place at Cambridge and eventually became estranged from his father, of whom he now says: ‘Funnily enough he looked very like Jeremy Corbyn. And his worldview was pretty similar too.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like so many of his generation, the 1968 Paris riots – in which student protests against capitalism almost brought the entire country to a halt – were the defining political moment of Scruton’s life.</p><img id="i-f8b507cd804dd701" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/08/23/5955464-6369831-image-m-32_1541719054208.jpg" height="435" width="634" alt="Professor Sir Roger Scruton with his wife Sophie and children Sam and Lucy Investitures at Buckingham Palace" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was in the Latin Quarter of Paris when students tore up cobblestones to hurl at riot police. His friends overturned cars to build barricades. As he watched from his apartment window, Scruton had a Damascene conversion. ‘I suddenly realised that I was on the other side,’ he says. ‘What I saw was an unruly mob of self-indulgent middle-class hooligans. When I asked my friends what they were they trying to achieve, all I got back was ludicrous Marxist gobbledegook. I was disgusted. That’s when I became a conservative. I knew I wanted to conserve things rather than pull them down.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Following a brief marriage to Paris student Danielle Laffitte, the wild-haired tweed-coated professor of philosophy and aesthetics at London’s Birkbeck College joined a chain of Western academics secretly teaching behind the Iron Curtain. He provided covert classes in Prague leading to university degrees for dissidents and was detained and expelled by the communist government.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the mid-1980s Scruton published a volume of prescient essays, Thinkers of the New Left, attacking the grip of Marxists in universities. Vice-chancellors were outraged and his publishers, under pressure of a boycott from their more profitable academic writers, remaindered the book.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Driven from academia he started a new life in a farmhouse in Wiltshire, with 100 acres of land, which he calls ‘Scrutopia’. In his timbered rural idyll he churns out books on architecture, music, religion and politics. He has a string of hunting horses (another reason the Left hate him) and met his second wife Sophie, 30 years his junior, when they were riding. They have two children.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Never far from controversy, Scruton was damaged by the revelation in 2002 that he was taking money from tobacco companies while criticising the World Health Organisation campaign against smoking.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2016 he was knighted for ‘services to philosophy, teaching and public education’. But to this day he is despised by an education establishment which instinctively distrusts Right-wing academics.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As Scruton himself said last year: ‘Once you are identified as Right-wing, you are beyond the pale of argument… You are not an opponent to be argued with, but a disease to be shunned.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The Left’s ‘archaeological dig’ in search of material that they could potentially label as offensive has echoes of the witch-hunt against another Right-winger who was appointed to a government post.

At least one in six of the bosses of Britain’s most powerful companies ended up on a blacklist of companies drawn up for Theresa May — firms where more than 20 per cent of investors voted against a director’s pay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet until now — and despite the mounting opprobrium levelled against them — almost all the executives involved have remained in their jobs and very few have suffered pay cuts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is because, as angry as many of the shareholder revolts have been, there has still been a reluctance to get rid of bosses who are still bringing home surging profits, dividend payments and rising share prices.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, ousting grotesquely overpaid chief executives only seems to have happened when some other complaint in addition to excessive pay has been levelled against the individual.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was the case for Martin Sorrell, former boss of advertising giant WPP, who took home £70 million in 2015 to the fury of many shareholders, but only finally left the company this year after being accused of paying £300 for a prostitute on company expenses and of bullying his assistants (charges he denies).</p><img id="i-134b28d7a86dce4e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/08/00/5909608-0-Sir_Martin_Sorrell_former_boss_of_advertising_giant_WPP_took_hom-m-22_1541636565806.jpg" height="641" width="634" alt="Sir Martin Sorrell, former boss of advertising giant WPP, took home £70 million in 2015 to the fury of many shareholders, but only finally left the company this year after being accused of paying £300 for a prostitute on company expenses and of bullying his assistants (charges he denies)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The decision by Roger Devlin, the new chairman at Persimmon, to tell Fairburn that he had to go for the sake of the company sets a precedent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the five years Fairburn was at the helm, Persimmon’s stock market value doubled to £7.5 billion, while some £2.2 billion was returned to investors as dividends and profits hit £1 billion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The fact is that Fairburn is leaving in spite of the firm’s commercial success. And this can only be seen as a triumph for better governance in the boardroom.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the company’s apparently miraculous performance has actually come to a large extent at taxpayers’ expense.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Persimmon achieved much of its profits by building properties under the Government’s lavish £10 billion Help To Buy Scheme — designed to lend a hand to people struggling to get on to the property ladder.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Support for Fairburn began to unravel in December last year after he was offered a pay packet of £102 million, with his lieutenants also being offered rapacious rewards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fairburn argued this was ‘in line with accepted practice’, but it appalled Persimmon’s then chairman, Rothschild banker Nicholas Wrigley, and the chairman of the company’s remuneration committee, Jonathan Davie, both of whom suddenly resigned.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their protest galvanised shareholders into action and Fairburn’s bonus was capped at £75 million.</p><img id="i-50b517f9131491fd" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/08/00/5909674-0-image-a-24_1541636675294.jpg" height="399" width="634" alt="Fairburn’s resignation is in many ways a signal moment in the battle by successive governments and City grandees to bring a halt to the outlandish behaviour of too many FTSE 100 chief executives" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite the reduction, more than 48 per cent of shareholders registered a protest vote over pay levels at the annual general meeting in April. In an effort to show he was listening, Fairburn put out a statement saying he intended to set up a charitable trust. But no more was heard of it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There have been no details of who the trustees would be, how much money would be put into the foundation and what causes it might support.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What makes it all the worse is that Fairburn has remained impervious to criticism. The final straw came when he was interviewed by the BBC’s Look North programme last month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the reporter asked him about his pay, the Persimmon tycoon declared the question ‘unfortunate’ and walked off mid-interview.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was this act of petulance that finally convinced a strengthened Persimmon board that its chief executive had become toxic — Fairburn was either refusing to, or incapable of, explaining his position to shareholders and the broader audience of taxpayers who contributed to his riches through Help To Buy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And though Fairburn has now gone, the ramifications of this scandal certainly haven’t.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Shoddy</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has cast a light on to an industry entrusted with meeting Britain’s housing needs. It is an industry, furthermore, that Labour has repeatedly threatened with punitive sanctions, such as seizing or taxing ‘land banks’ — land that companies have bought and are holding on to for future development — and even full-blown state control of house building.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The industry’s cause has not been helped by reports of shoddy construction, while Persimmon was also among a group of housebuilders who sold homes on leaseholds with escalating ground rents.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These were then packaged up and sold on to third-party financiers — an exploitative practice that made homes impossible to sell on and is now expected to be outlawed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As Persimmon and firms like it paid out vast bonuses to its bosses and piled up its profits, its customers seemed to be the last thing on its mind.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Persimmon is by no means alone.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Who but a halfwit could doubt that we are in the midst of a violent crime epidemic which neither the police nor the Government seem able to do much about?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the past week there have been five fatal stabbings in <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-b9ac3c10-e2e9-11e8-99fd-f3b5ee63f54d">London</a>. By the time you read this, the grisly toll could have climbed to six. After all, an average of 40 knife crimes every day are carried out in the capital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Violent crime is soaring — and the word is not misused. After years during which it appeared to be in decline, there has been a sudden explosion of offences which experts are incapable of explaining.</p><img id="i-bcb8678681ca132e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/07/22/5904076-0-image-a-52_1541628736115.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Mayor of London Sadiq Khan attends the MTV EMAs held at the SSE Arena, Wembley on November 12, 2017" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to official figures, violent crime in England and Wales has almost doubled in three years from 778,000 offences in 2015 to 1.4 million now. London is by far the most dangerous place in the country for knife crime, but violence is sharply on the increase everywhere.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Confronted with these horrifying developments, one would expect the authorities to display a sense of alarm and put forward policies intended to make our streets safer.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But in recent days there has been a virtual silence on the Government’s part. Oh, no — I do ministers an injustice. Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, tweeted that he was ‘absolutely determined to tackle knife crime’ and refused ‘to write off a generation of young people’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All over the capital youthful hoodlums will be quaking with fear in the knowledge that the authorities aren’t going to sit on their backsides any longer, and will be coming after them.</p><div class="item">

But he only succeeded in deepening the general gloom by suggesting it might take a decade to bring violent crime under control.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ten years? That’s a terribly long time. It turns out Mr Khan is pinning his hopes on a ‘public health approach’ as has been tried out in Glasgow, where the murder rate has halved since 2005.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the Scottish city, teenage gang members were offered a way out of crime through education, training and mentoring. Social workers and teachers were involved in the programme, working alongside the police.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It sounds a good idea, though we can’t be sure whether such an approach would work in the capital. But talk about bringing such a human disaster under control by 2028 reveals a complacency and absence of urgency that can only be described as mind-boggling.</p><img id="i-2ae60f3c79fba044" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/07/22/5904088-0-image-a-61_1541629041303.jpg" height="367" width="634" alt="Mr Khan and his wife Saadiya watch the Wimbledon men’s singles final from the Royal Box on July 15" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">No, what is needed is better policing now. I’m afraid there is plenty of evidence that clear-up rates of crimes are falling and the police are becoming increasingly ineffectual.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to one recent analysis of all crimes committed over a five-year period, the proportion solved fell from 19 per cent in 2013 to 9 per cent last year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The clear-up rate of homicides is significantly greater, but here, too, there has been a marked decline. In London last year, 72 per cent of murders and manslaughters were solved, compared with more than 90 per cent in previous years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The police will say they are less effective because of cutbacks. This is certainly partly true. But the reduction in police numbers of some 14 per cent since 2010 cannot entirely explain the larger fall in the clear-up rate of crime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is hard to resist the interpretation that the police are getting less good at solving crimes, doubtless partly because their energies are exhausted in investigating the ever-growing number of ‘hate crimes’, many of which are trivial.</p><img id="i-45358d00a05726e6" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/08/00/5904032-6365093-Mr_Khan_said_he_felt_honoured_and_humbled_after_visiting_the_Gol-a-21_1541636342673.jpg" height="626" width="634" alt="Mr Khan said he felt ‘honoured and humbled’ after visiting the Golden Temple in Amritsar, India" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile they very seldom patrol the streets. The other day in central Oxford I observed two officers chatting in a police van. Bizarrely, it didn’t occur to either of them to get out and make their presence felt on the street.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The consequence of police shortcomings is a breakdown in public confidence. The Commons Home Affairs Select Committee recently drew the extraordinary, though I fear correct, conclusion that ‘policing is at risk of becoming irrelevant to most people’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And yesterday the policing minister, Nick Hurd, wrote in a newspaper article that the police may forsake public trust unless they are able to explain to victims why officers are failing to investigate crimes. He was passing the buck, but he’s right.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Somehow the police have to improve their performance. Given the hidebound (and I fear sometimes not very intelligent) mindset of many senior officers, this won’t be done without encouragement and intervention from ministers.</p><img id="i-67fd447534dd6293" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/07/22/5903978-0-image-a-56_1541628804045.jpg" height="953" width="634" alt="Sadiq Khan, Adrian Lester, Lolita Chakrabarti and Saadiya Khan attend the press night performance of &quot;Hamilton&quot; at The Victoria Palace Theatre on December 21, 2017 in London " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the Government is much at fault, too. When it began to chip away at police budgets in 2010, crime was falling, and for a time it seemed cutbacks would have no deleterious effect.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now violent crime is rising quickly, it is no longer possible to maintain that falling police numbers haven’t made a contribution. As Home Secretary, Theresa May wielded the knife too uncritically.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Tories should take care. More reductions in police numbers are planned, not least in London. Can they honestly believe the public will forgive them if these go ahead while knife crime is spiralling?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And do ministers truly believe it is morally defensible to increase the foreign aid budget year by year (at £14 billion it is now larger than the entire police budget for England and Wales) while continuing to deprive officers of the resources they need to protect the public?</p><img id="i-c230bb14bf8cd681" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/07/22/5903988-0-image-a-64_1541629137751.jpg" height="453" width="634" alt="The mayor chats with Fulham FC and Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan, centre, before a match at Wembley on October 28" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another fault of the Government — and of Theresa May as Home Secretary — was to put pressure on the police to curtail their use of ‘stop and search’. This was done for what seemed the best of reasons, since non-whites were more likely to be stopped by police than whites.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But non-whites are often proportionately more at risk from knife crime, and deserve protection. More and more people are carrying lethal knives, including children as young as ten. Are the police really expected only to intervene in extremis? Apparently so. In 2008 the Metropolitan Police used stop and search 700,000 times, but last year that figure stood at just over 100,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Only a very bigoted and narrow-minded criminologist would deny a possible link between a rapid rise in knife crime and a no-less-rapid fall in the use of stop and search.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The criminal justice system is also a shambles. The Mail revealed yesterday that many repeat offenders have avoided jail over the past three years despite being caught with a knife for a second time. Under new laws introduced by the Government in 2015, they should be locked up for at least six months.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No doubt the Tories feel vulnerable because they have reduced police numbers and discouraged stop and search. They cling to the old arguments despite evidence to the contrary. But when circumstances change, intelligent people change their minds with them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">London in particular is seen by its citizens, and I suspect by many people abroad, as a dangerous place. It is a tragic reflection that there was a kernel of truth in President Trump’s wild depiction of the capital as ‘a war zone for stabbing’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When will the Government start taking these terrible developments seriously?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">People can’t wait until 2028. It’s time for old mistakes to be rectified, and for new action to be taken.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sadiq Khan has been oh-so-busy!</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The surge in London’s violent crime hasn’t put a dent in mayor Sadiq Khan’s jet-setting lifestyle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Khan was criticised this week after he warned it could take ‘a generation’ to bring the city’s crime problem under control.

When Gordon Brown and George Osborne were Chancellor, Treasury Questions drew one of the big gates of the month. That was partly because Brown and Osborne had cohorts of groupies. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was also because MPs relished the partisan fireworks.

And it’s no help, either, to the grieving mother of Jay Hughes, 15, stabbed to death outside a chicken shop in Lewisham last Thursday, or to Malcolm Mide-Madariola, 17, killed in Clapham last Friday, or the 16-year-old, identified as a rapper known as JaySav, who died in Tulse Hill on Monday night.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s already too late for them. And it will be too late for those who, inevitably, and depressingly, will join the rising death toll across Britain before the year is out.

Like many his age, he walks to and from school (when children are most likely to be attacked).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m lucky that he’s a sensible lad and so are his friends. But I’m not deluded: I know there are gangs operating in our area.

Long-term, many things can be done to change the toxic culture behind these deaths. Schools, communities, parents — all can play their part. But short-term, there is only one answer: more police on our streets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Everyone understands the need to make economies in public services. But not at the expense of children’s lives. The only thing that will make parents sleep more soundly at night is the knowledge that there are men and women out there whose job it is to protect the safety of our streets — and that they have the resources and the mandate to do so.</p><div class="item">

]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>SARAH VINE: When confronted about the rising tide of knife crime in the capital (pictured right some of the latest stabbings) — and what he was planning to do about it — the best the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, could come up with was that it could take ‘a generation’ to solve the problem. It was a characteristically weak and defeatist response from a man who seems to be doing everything to exonerate himself from responsibility in this matter. The scale and the urgency of the crisis (pictured left floral tributes are left for 15-year-old Jay Hughes stabbed to death last Thursday) appear to have eluded a mayor more at home posing for virtue-signalling selfies than attending to the wounds that are staining his city’s streets with the blood of its young.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The thunderous cheers and occasional boos inside the arena were pure pantomime, as were the outrageous boasts and whopping lies being told by the night’s main attraction, the President of the United States.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 12,000-strong crowd that turned out in the Tennessee city of Chattanooga on Sunday night to see <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/donald_trump/index.html" id="mol-ebc510e0-e164-11e8-a701-d5bb3348842a">Donald Trump</a> ahead of today’s crucial mid-term congressional elections — elections that could fortify or cripple his presidency — were treated to a true showman at work.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He whipped them up into paroxysms of pride in him, their Commander-in-Chief, alternating with semi-hysterical fear of their opponents, whether it was the Democrats who would destroy the U.S. from within, or violent immigrants ‘invading’ from beyond its borders.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Scroll down for video </strong></p><img id="i-adc1989c598d758f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/06/01/5812906-0-image-a-1_1541466618903.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="US President Donald Trump is seen arriving for a campaign rally in the Tennessee city of Chattanooga. He was appearing ahead of today’s crucial mid-term congressional elections" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Afterwards, the people of this staunchly white and Republican state flooded out into the pouring rain and the cold reality of Trump-era America where protesters armed with megaphones shouted: ‘Stop spreading the hate.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some of the bloodiest battles of the American Civil War were fought in this area, and there have been claims that the U.S. faces a new civil war. Certainly, the country is polarised as never before with people far more acrimoniously divided about Trump than when he was elected in 2016.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Increasingly, families and communities across the nation are split by the simple issue of what they think of their President.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A Trump supporter called Steve Spaeth made headlines last week when he admitted telling his liberal, Democrat sister: ‘If there is a civil war in this country and you were on the wrong side, I would have no problem shooting you in the face.’</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">His chilling comments came just a week after another rabid Trump supporter sent pipe bombs to 14 of the President’s leading opponents. Then a Right-wing extremist gunman who blamed Jewish Left-wingers for encouraging illegal immigration shot dead 11 Jewish worshippers in a Pittsburgh synagogue.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, Trump supporters are no longer embarrassed to admit publicly that they support the President.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Gridlock</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the midst of this bitter conflagration, the man fuelling it was conducting a last-minute blitz of rallies across the U.S. to bolster Republican support in the elections which take place mid-way through a president’s four-year term.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump’s name isn’t on any ballot ticket, but the stakes could not be higher in these mid-terms, which involve all 435 seats in the House of Representatives (roughly equivalent to the Commons), and around a third (35) of those in the 100-seat upper house, the Senate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is a referendum on his presidency. Until now, Trump’s administration has been far more free of determined political opposition than it might have been, because both the House of Representatives and the Senate have been Republican-controlled.</p><img id="i-e6ea570ecb559bfd" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/06/01/5812912-6356881-image-a-2_1541466683059.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Trump has been heavily campaigning ahead of the mid-term elections, but despite this the Republicans are expected to be hit with heavy losses in the House" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-52ea56d5b6bdc196" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/06/01/5812926-6356881-image-a-3_1541466684815.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pencea were both at the rally in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Trump has maintained a busy campaign schedule in the final stretch of the race, with 11 rallies over six days" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">If, as is widely predicted, Democrats pick up the 23 extra seats needed to give them control of the House of Representatives, the Trump agenda could be submerged in bureaucratic gridlock for the rest of his term.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And a Democrat-controlled House could also order new investigations into the President’s personal and business affairs — and likely try to impeach him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Senate looks significantly less likely to go to the Democrats, but nothing is ever certain when it comes to Donald Trump who spectacularly defied pollsters’ predictions in 2016.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The astonishing contradiction at the heart of this divided nation was dramatically illustrated by a CNN poll yesterday. It showed that a majority of voters believe the country is heading in the right direction — thanks largely to a surging economy and jobs boom as Trump has slashed taxes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But only 39 per cent of them approve of Trump, which is the worst rating for a president at this stage since Dwight Eisenhower in the early Fifties.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most ominously, the same poll found eight out of ten voters believe the country has rarely been more deeply divided on major issues.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Polls indicate women are particularly turning against Trump, appalled by his misogynist remarks about female opponents and the sleazy allegations — which he denies — about his affairs with porn stars and Playboy glamour models.</p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">This is particularly bad news for him, as suburban white women played a key role in electing him. Anti-Trump protesters, mainly young women, turned out to make their presence felt in the hours before he arrived at the weekend rally at Chattanooga’s McKenzie Arena.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tensions rose following the arrival of a small group of Proud Boys, a far-Right, men-only organisation that has been accused of being violent white supremacists. The group sparked outrage last month when members beat up anti-fascist protesters after a Republican event in Manhattan. ‘We’re just showing our support for our President. That’s all,’ said one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once inside the arena, it’s hard not to agree with those who say Trump’s hardcore supporters will never lose faith in him. Time and again as I questioned them, they budged barely a millimetre from the belief that he had been an almost unalloyed success.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some accepted it had come at a price. Trump supporter Angie Lae bemoaned the polarisation of political opinion. ‘People are either 100 per cent pro-Trump or 100 per cent anti. There’s no happy medium,’ she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Contempt</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her husband, Mark, a carpenter, believes Trump is a ‘godly’ president who has put morality back into the U.S.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tennessee is solid Bible Belt and evangelical Trump supporters had a common refrain when asked why they were still supporting a man who boasts of groping women and has been accused of being a serial cheat. His past was irrelevant, they insist. Everyone makes mistakes.</p><img id="i-c1c316d5e582320c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/06/01/5812920-6356881-image-a-4_1541466709171.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Supporters turned out in their thousands to watch Trump's rally in Chattanooga, Tennessee. There were around 12,000 in the crowd who watched the US President deliver a speech ahead of crucial mid-term congressional elections" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Janice Boydston, a 77-year-old teacher wearing Trump socks, T-shirt and woolly hat, said his foibles paled beside those of Democrats who ‘support abortion, gay marriage and open borders’. ‘There’s no end to the evil that will happen if they get hold of Congress,’ she added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Southerners pride themselves on their courteousness, but neither side could hide their contempt for their opponents. Danyne Bharj, 47, married to a Briton, articulated the double standards at play, admitting she ‘would never have Trump as my pastor, but I’m happy to have him as my President’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s easier to understand why America has become so toxically divided when one realises both sides cannot even agree on the basics about their President.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Fantasies</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Evidence that Trump is a racist, misogynist and compulsive liar are automatically dismissed by his fans as media distortion. For them, his presidency hasn’t been soured or discredited by his puerile insults aimed at North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, his alleged antics with porn star Stormy Daniels, his tasteless description of ‘beautiful’ barbed wire on the Mexico border, or his unjustifiable claim at this rally that his administration is ‘breaking every record practically in the history of our country’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They see only a president who has stood up to America’s enemies and trading rivals, defends U.S. borders and brings new jobs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump once admitted he ‘plays to people’s fantasies’ and he saved the biggest fantasy for the end of his speech on Sunday night when he quoted from the Oath of Allegiance’s description of the U.S. as ‘one nation under God’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That hopeful description has rarely looked less appropriate.</p><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">For a while now, the former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson has been snapped popping in and out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-f4accc90-e162-11e8-a76a-6f27d3d06912">London</a> to visit its infamous resident, the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Needless to say, the enticing way in which Pamela dresses for their political discussions has led to speculation that romance is in the air. How close are they? In a television interview at the weekend, Pamela admitted that she and Assange were ‘very close’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Furthermore, their long meetings at the Ecuadorian Embassy leave her ‘exhausted’. But she added that though they share ‘a romantic struggle’, they are not an item. ‘We don’t have a romantic relationship like that,’ she said.</p><img id="i-ed725264cdcd08a5" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/06/01/5813018-0-image-m-44_1541466843419.jpg" height="434" width="634" alt="For a while now, the former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson has been snapped popping in and out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to visit its infamous resident, the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Is Pamela just being bashful? I do hope so. We are currently living through a boom time for what one might term HG or ‘Horizontal Genealogy’. If Pamela Anderson were to get together with Julian Assange, several HG family trees would be completed.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let me explain. Pamela Anderson used to be married to Tommy Lee, the drummer with Motley Crue. Before that, Tommy Lee dated the happily named actress Tawny Kitaen, who, in the mid-Eighties, was the girlfriend of O.J. Simpson. So this particular romantic ribbon could have joined Julian Assange to O.J. Simpson in just four kisses (Julian - Pamela - Tommy -Tawny - O.J.).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there is another line from Pamela Anderson that yields even more surprising links. Tommy Lee was also married to the Dynasty star Heather Locklear. ‘Tommy doesn’t worship the devil, he worships me,’ she once remarked.</p><img id="i-13fe398fb5e3ceeb" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/06/01/5813082-0-image-a-45_1541466924447.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Needless to say, the enticing way in which Pamela dresses for their political discussions has led to speculation that romance is in the air. How close are they? In a television interview at the weekend, Pamela admitted that she and Assange were ¿very close¿" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before she met Tommy Lee, Heather went out with an actor called Scott Baio, the star of Happy Days and a little-known film called Zapped! Early this century, Baio had a fling with Liza Minnelli; he even claimed she had asked him to father her child.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back in 1986, the nervy Minnelli had a dalliance with the luxuriously moustachioed American TV presenter Geraldo Rivera, who ungallantly boasted about it in his 1991 kiss-and-tell memoir, Exposing Myself. In that same work, Rivera also revealed he had enjoyed a quick fling on a rowing boat in Central Park with Margaret Trudeau, the former wife of the Canadian Prime Minister (and mother of the current one).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, just to recap, this line would now go: Julian - Pamela - Tommy - Heather - Scott - Liza - Geraldo - Margaret. But it doesn’t end there: not by a long chalk. In the late Seventies, Margaret Trudeau had an affair with Mick Jagger, who is in many ways the Spaghetti Junction of Horizontal Genealogy.</p><img id="i-7175efb890488c3f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/06/01/5813146-0-image-a-46_1541466964781.jpg" height="881" width="634" alt="Pamela Anderson used to be married to Tommy Lee, the drummer with Motley Crue" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">One branch line from Mick Jagger takes you through his second wife, Jerry Hall, and on to her new husband, Rupert Murdoch. This would link Julian Assange to Rupert Murdoch in just ten kisses.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the other hand, some may prefer to take the scenic route. In the Seventies, Mick Jagger had a romance with Carly Simon (‘He made me feel fantastic’), who had earlier been an item with Warren Beatty (‘We made love like in a movie’).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From Warren Beatty, the line can be made to progress in almost any direction you want. In one direction, it even arrives (via Barbra Streisand-Elliott Gould-Vicki Hodge) at The Duke of York and Fergie, should you so want it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Personally, I prefer to leap from Beatty to the British actress Carol White, known as The Battersea Bardot. White once spent three romantic weeks in Palm Beach with Frank Sinatra. Frank Sinatra, in turn, had a fling with Marilyn Monroe, who enjoyed a famous relationship with President Kennedy. By my reckoning, this would link Julian Assange to President Kennedy in 14 kisses.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Are you paying attention at the back? Another line from Marilyn Monroe takes you to her affair with Orson Welles, via his marriage to Rita Hayworth, and Rita Hayworth’s marriage to the playboy Aly Khan. Aly Khan was the lover of the socialite Thelma Furness who is most famous for being the girlfriend of — tarantara! — King Edward VIII.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So there we have it: a modest 17 kisses link Pamela Anderson to King Edward VIII. If only Julian Assange and Pamela Anderson could be persuaded to abandon their wretched ‘romantic struggle’ and get on with it, then Assange would be linked for ever to King Edward VIII. And from there to the Duchess of Windsor. Or would that be going too far?</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>For a while now, the former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson has been snapped popping in and out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to visit its infamous resident, the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange.

He possessed far more clout than most Cabinet ministers, and had the capacity to make or break careers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was a close adviser and personal friend to <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/tony_blair/index.html" id="mol-a9c70bb0-e080-11e8-9b8f-a51c356eb134">Tony Blair</a>, Gordon Brown and <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/david_cameron/index.html" id="mol-a9c36230-e080-11e8-9b8f-a51c356eb134">David Cameron</a>. He ran their lives, made things happen – and just as often stopped them from happening.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was fixer, counsellor, and all too often the crutch of successive prime ministers. But for his untimely death yesterday from cancer at the age of only 56, Sir Jeremy would have performed this role for <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/theresa_may/index.html" id="mol-a9c6e4a0-e080-11e8-9b8f-a51c356eb134">Theresa May</a> as well.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some thought he was much too powerful. The Daily Mail dubbed him ‘Sir Cover-Up’ after it emerged that he had blocked the release of letters and phone calls between Blair and US President, George W Bush, in the run up to the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/iraq/index.html" id="mol-a9c84430-e080-11e8-9b8f-a51c356eb134">Iraq</a> War in 2003.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was a nickname that he hated and although there’s no escaping that it was intended as an insult, it was part grudging tribute, too. Sir Jeremy valued secrecy and there are many who share his view that a great deal of government business ought to take place behind closed doors.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Occasionally when I criticised him in my columns he would call me into his capacious Whitehall office and we would hammer out our differences.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2011, at the time of his appointment by Cameron to head the Civil Service, I wrote that he was not the best choice. The Blair years had led to too cosy a relationship between ministers and civil servants, too much dominance from the centre, and a collapse of due process.</p><img id="i-d750535e26a7b032" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/04/22/5762710-6352347-image-a-4_1541369960463.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Sir Heywood (to Theresa May's right) was one of the two or three most powerful men in Britain for a quarter of a century" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The last time we clashed about something I had written – over the Chilcot Report into the Iraq War – it led to bad blood. A civil servant called to tell me that Sir Jeremy Heywood wanted me to know that he was ‘shocked and appalled’ by my criticism. I never got the opportunity to mend relations, and this now fills me with sadness because fundamentally he was a decent man. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no question that Sir Jeremy, who was ennobled to Lord Heywood after he retired through ill health a few days before his death, was a patriot who embodied the noble ideal of public service and who mastered every detail of every brief he was ever given.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May led the tributes from across the political spectrum yesterday. ‘He worked tirelessly to serve our country in the finest traditions of the Civil Service and he is a huge loss to British public life,’ she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From the moment Heywood entered the Civil Service in 1983 after a brilliant academic career (Oxford, LSE, Harvard) he dedicated himself to the public good.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He gave every hour to the job as a young man, and his workload continued to be prodigious after he married his wife Suzanne – with whom he had three children – in 1997.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a statement, she remembered a ‘wonderful father’ who ‘crammed a huge amount into his 56 years’. She said: ‘Jeremy could light up any room or conversation and loved hosting a good party.’</p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">His first post was as an economist at the Health and Safety Executive, but his talent was quickly spotted and he first came to widespread notice as private secretary to then chancellor Norman Lamont when sterling crashed out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992. He proved his indispensability in a crisis when John Major’s briefing note for the Maastricht negotiations was lost. As the former PM recalled in his autobiography: ‘Eventually Jeremy Heywood let out a whoop of delight. He had discovered it among Norman Lamont’s papers.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Colleagues said that during this frenetic time, the boyishly good-looking Heywood lived on coffee and cigarettes, and shared a car to work rather than take public transport so that he could smoke.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When New Labour came into power, he was soon promoted to Downing Street as private secretary to Blair – a move that engendered some resentment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some senior civil servants felt that Heywood was much too ready to abandon traditional Civil Service procedures and embrace Blair’s notorious culture of ‘sofa government’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Blair – normally hostile to the Civil Service – adored Heywood and wanted to fast track him to Permanent Secretary in defiance of the Civil Service career structure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When this move was blocked by mandarins, a disgruntled Heywood quit the Civil Service in 2003 for a job with investment bank Morgan Stanley in the City.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was Gordon Brown who persuaded him to return in 2007 as head of domestic policy and strategy in the Cabinet Office, bringing order to the new PM’s chaotic fledgling administration. Within months, Sir Jeremy was at the centre of the desperate negotiations to sort out the 2008 financial crash.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The experience he gained then at a time of national and international crisis and his good standing with David Cameron when he arrived at No 10 in 2010, meant that he was ideally poised to become Cabinet Secretary – the most senior figure in the Civil Service and one of only 11 men to have held the post since it was created in 1916 – when Gus O’Donnell stepped down in 2012. He was knighted in the New Year’s Honours List that year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I believe Sir Jeremy’s greatest achievement was the way in which he heroically held together the Cameron/Clegg coalition government till the 2015 general election. He dealt in ‘solutions’ and because he was trusted by both sides was uniquely placed to resolve differences.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was not long after this that he was diagnosed with the disease that killed him. Some of those closest to Theresa May say that many of the difficulties of her premiership to date have occurred because of Sir Jeremy’s enforced absence –not least the long running face of the Brexit negotiations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We will never know for sure. Sir Ollie Robins, the PM’s Europe adviser and lead Brexit negotiator, said in a heartfelt statement last night: ‘I will miss Jeremy very much.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So will many, many others.  </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>PETER OBORNE: Sir Jeremy Heywood (left with his wife) was a close adviser of Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron.

But here in Virginia another bloody legacy overshadows this campaign. Orange is a 40-minute drive from Charlottesville, the scene of violent clashes between anti-fascists and neo-Nazis that resulted in the death of activist Heather Heyer. ‘If it wasn’t for Donald Trump, Heather Heyer would still be alive,’ farmer and Spanberger supporter Bill Speiden tells me. ‘He’s changed everything. In Orange, friends are turning on each other. My wife had someone come up to her and say, “I just wanted to see what a commie ranter looks like.” It’s never been like that here before.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another Spanberger supporter, education supervisor James Dallas, echoes him. ‘We’re not the United States any more. This isn’t who we’re supposed to be.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Later that evening, I fall into conversation with Roger Clark, a beekeeper from Cedar Mountain. He says that for the first 48 hours after Trump’s victory he had to cut himself off from the world. Then his wife Linda interjects. ‘I voted for Trump,’ she says. ‘Hillary kills babies.’</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-f9363b80-dfd1-11e8-982d-83619779bee4">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox">I voted for Trump, Hillary kills babies </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I finally track down the Brat campaign to a bar in the small town of Blackstone. But I arrive to find the Congressman berating local journalists – ‘do you check your facts?’ – and I am told my presence is not welcome. Fortunately, some of his supporters are more forthcoming.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Dave and Trump both talk common sense,’ Jeanne Everahat, a wife and mother, tells me. ‘We need to close our borders. Just look at the migrant caravan’ – a reference to the 7,000 migrants marching towards the US/Mexico border, and Trump’s pledge to halt their advance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She agrees about the polarised nature of the campaign, but blames that primarily on the media.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘If you actually get out there, it looks very different. You see blacks in high places. You see whites in high places. I’m afraid a lot of this division is your fault.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A moment later I’m joined by Billy Coleburn, the mayor of Blackstone. He explains the Brat campaign’s defensiveness is because they believe Spanberger’s team have deployed ‘trackers’ to disrupt the event. ‘They send them in to follow and confront Dave and try to get him to lose his cool,’ he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eventually Brat’s organiser, the magnificently named William Outlaw, appears. He apologises for my eviction, but again blames it on the toxic nature of the campaign. ‘I genuinely believe at the heart of what we’re seeing is the fact that Donald Trump wasn’t supposed to win,’ he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The liberals just can’t accept it. That’s where the outrage and the violence are coming from. But it doesn’t have to be this way.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m told I can catch up with Brat at the Louisa fairground.</p><img id="i-2d86a6909fcfdff7" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/04/01/5740762-6350609-image-a-32_1541296702728.jpg" height="399" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the drive out of Blackstone I pass another giant sign: ‘Trump: Yes We Did! Now: Lock Her Up!’ It may not have to be this way. But here in Virginia, it is.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At Louisa, the Halloween fair organised by a local church is in full swing. Mothers and fathers wander round, tiny ghosts and ghouls in tow, while the band plays an infuriatingly catchy version of Christian pop. Clearly feeling he is among his own people, Dave Brat is starting to relax. ‘We’re doing good. We’re trending up,’ he says smiling. But then the bugles of the Civil War of 2018 sound again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The tone of the campaign was great in my district for years,’ he declares angrily. ‘But with Spanberger and the campaign it’s all negative. We’ve had them swearing at us to stop us speaking. We had a pastor giving an invocation, and they stopped him speaking.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The Dems have been using tactics like you’ve never seen.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brat insists he’s trying to run a positive campaign. But if he is, word doesn’t seem to have reached some of his supporters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I’m voting for him because he’s not one of those crazy Democrats going around doing crazy stuff,’ Jack Singleton tells me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘As a free American, I don’t like certain people and I’m going to vote against any of them.’</p><img id="i-99ee424a34bbae5b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/04/01/5740516-6350609-image-a-23_1541296425818.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="President Donald Trump speaks at a rally, November 2, at the Tri-State Airport in Huntington, West Virginia" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He is especially concerned about gun rights. ‘I would prefer every person in this crowd had a gun. Then if anyone bad came in here, everyone could just put them down.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Francis Poindexter, the organiser of the fair, is praying for divine salvation from her political opponents. ‘I believe God is in this situation,’ she says. ‘Look at Donald Trump. Everything we pray for happens.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Did the Lord deliver Donald Trump? ‘Absolutely,’ she replies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the figure waving to the crowds on Friday in a chilly airport hangar at Huntingdon Tri-State airport is the product of divine intervention, he isn’t letting on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is one of Donald Trump’s final appearances of the mid-term campaign, and he is seizing the moment. ‘We’re here to celebrate our amazing achievements together. To make sure America’s great comeback continues. We’re now moving full speed ahead like nobody thought was possible.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To many these are classic hackneyed Trumpisms. But at least he is deploying an upbeat message. The audience responds enthusiastically. And for a moment I start to think perhaps the talk of a nation turning against itself is overblown.</p><img id="i-4125532621255434" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/04/02/5740758-6350609-image-a-37_1541296803072.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Supporters hold campaign signs during a Make America Great Again campaign rally" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then his tone, and the mood, changes. He begins regaling the crowd with a blood-curling description of the migrants marching towards America’s border.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are violent offenders, sexual offenders, murderers, he warns. ‘Do we let them in?’ he asks. ‘Build the wall!’ the crowd chants in response.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just before leaving Virginia, I drive out to the Confederate Cemetery in Spotsylvania. Rows of small white headstones, some recently tended with Confederate flags, line the circular grounds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the base of the monument, tucked discreetly round the back, are the following words: ‘We have gathered the sacred dust, of warriors tried and true, who bore the flag of our nation’s trust, and fell in the cause, though lost, still just, and died for me and you.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like their forefathers 150 years ago, the warriors of both sides in the new US Civil War believe in the absolute justness of their cause. On Tuesday, the American people will decide who is right.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Army veteran Jim Berry fixes me with a grizzled stare and doesn't mince his words.

They say I am not an expert on the subject.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Well, if they are all such experts, why is the British police force such a failure, openly admitting it is a flop on its own terms? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It cannot even investigate huge numbers of the crimes it has allowed to happen by being so feeble in the first place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s quite simple. The police are supposed to deliver safety, peace, justice and order. They visibly don’t.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps it is because their baseball caps are all too tight, but the police have this delusion that this debate is all about them, their numbers and conditions. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is not. It is about the people they have failed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I will cite some well-known examples, which cannot be blamed on the mild spending cuts which have slightly reduced police numbers from their historic peak around ten years ago.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first is that of Fiona Pilkington and her daughter Frankie, who had severe learning difficulties and became a target for a gang of louts in their Leicestershire village. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Horribly, Fiona and Frankie were not safe in their own home, where they endured jeering sieges in which their house was pelted with eggs and flour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their neighbours, understandably terrified that these feral persecutors would turn on them, knew all too well that law and authority were far away, and stayed out of it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fiona and her daughter endured this hell on earth for ten years, during which they appealed at least 27 times for police help. None came. </p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">So one day Fiona sank into a despair so complete that she went out and burned herself and her daughter to death in their small car.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there was Garry Newlove, who foolishly assumed that this was still an orderly, peaceful country. He challenged a group of youths outside his Warrington house. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He thought one of them had vandalised his wife’s car. The youths promptly kicked him to death, laughing as they did so.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More recently there was Richard Osborn-Brooks, who was immediately arrested after he killed one of two burglars while defending his home and his wife from a late-night break-in. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The police eventually let him go, but it is their rotten instincts I am interested in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Several things emerge from these cases. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One is that the police are very bad at responding to appeals for help from the weak. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The second is that their growing absence from the streets has made wrongdoers confident and also made the law-abiding fearful. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There simply should not be gangs of louts hanging around anywhere in the streets of a country with 120,000 police officers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The third is that the police are increasingly neutral between the criminal and his victim. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Marinated for years in a sauce of Left-wing rubbish about crime being caused by poverty and suffering, not to mention the other rubbish about hate crimes, they simply do not – as we would do – side with the man who has had his home violated and tried to defend it. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They treat such a man as if he were a criminal. We know about their reluctance to investigate burglaries, not surprising when this crime is now out of control. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But even worse is their fashionable, inexcusable, lazy and stupid decision to ignore the law against marijuana possession.</p><img id="i-442c2f6da24ed765" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/04/01/5489508-6350607-image-a-42_1541294724582.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="'What the police do is to wait for crime to happen, and then rush noisily to the scene,' writes Peter Hitchens" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I suspect that a very high proportion of the violence they then struggle to deal with is committed by young men who have destroyed their mental health by smoking marijuana. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the drug laws were properly enforced, there would be far less violence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any minute now some police apologist will tell me that I don’t sympathise with them enough, and should go on what is laughingly called a ‘patrol’ with them. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Look, I have been on such patrols. That is exactly why I know they are useless.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What the police do is to wait for crime to happen, and then rush noisily to the scene. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I will say it again and again until it sinks in. A police officer is very little use after a crime has been committed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He cannot unburgle you, unmug or unstab you. That is why I am completely unimpressed by the National Police Chiefs Council boss Sara Thornton trying to curry favour with the public by saying it is better to investigate burglaries than hate crimes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A burglary is a horror and a misery which can ruin a person’s life. Investigation won’t make that better. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What we want is to see burglaries and disorder prevented by proper, regular police foot patrols, which worked just fine until the liberals abolished them. </p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How long till MI5 turns its spooks on you?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When New Labour came into power in 1997, MI5’s huge files on Left-wing subversion were destroyed, a decision which greatly suited the many covert ex-Marxists in the Blair hierarchy. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was quickly followed by a politically correct inquisition which transformed the Security Service into a nest of fashionable liberalism. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was supposed to concentrate on way-out Islamists. But now we learn that it is to ‘take the lead in combating Right-wing terrorism’. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘What is that?’ you may well ask. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The killer of Jo Cox MP, conveniently identified by the authorities as an extremist, was plainly mentally ill and had no serious politics. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And Britain’s various white supremacist hooligans, while nasty, are not really a threat to the state.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I reckon these minor, isolated cases will form the excuse for surveillance, and perhaps worse, of anyone more conservative than the Tory Party. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It gives me the shivers.  </p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The Blairite spite that reduced our Queen to tears</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A new biography of Prince Charles notes his justified grief at the foolish decision to lay up the Royal Yacht Britannia, and not to replace her. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like anyone, he can make a reasoned case for that lovely ship’s huge pulling power, and the way she could be used to enhance our political influence and commercial success. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the Blairites were not being rational when they did this.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Today I am asking readers to indulge me in a mental experiment. Let’s imagine that <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/jeremy_corbyn/index.html" id="mol-be521fc0-deff-11e8-8da3-ff6b5757f07a">Jeremy Corbyn</a> won last year’s General Election and became prime minister.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And let’s also imagine that soon afterwards rumours emerged that Labour’s biggest political donor was not what he seemed. And that the real source of the money was none other than <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/vladimir_putin/index.html" id="mol-be53cd70-deff-11e8-8da3-ff6b5757f07a">Vladimir Putin</a>’s Kremlin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let’s further suppose that investigators establish close links between the Russian Ambassador in <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-be54b7d0-deff-11e8-8da3-ff6b5757f07a">London</a> and Mr Corbyn’s donor. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finally, let’s imagine that last week the police made the bombshell announcement they were investigating the funding of the Labour election campaign amidst growing fears that Russian money had influenced the result.</p><img id="i-4461929cae1b9d84" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/02/23/076B5913000003E8-6348317-image-a-1_1541202944838.jpg" height="486" width="634" alt="And let’s also imagine that soon afterwards rumours emerged that Labour’s biggest political donor was not what he seemed.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the claims were proven, he would be forced to resign and a General Election would follow, uncontaminated this time by alleged dirty Russian money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pure fantasy? Not quite. The events of the past 48 hours have, for millions of people around the country, understandably raised burning questions about the result of the 2016 EU Referendum.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On Thursday, the National Crime Agency announced that it had launched a criminal probe into Arron Banks, the insurance tycoon, amid questions over whether Russian money was used to influence the Referendum campaign.</p><img id="i-400900673ab2aacd" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/01/14/5658812-6341951-image-a-28_1541083874687.jpg" height="523" width="634" alt="Arron Banks is being investigated by police over Brexit campaign funding - and responded with this tweet of himself relaxing in Bermuda" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Banks put a staggering £8 million into funding the Leave Campaign, making him the largest individual political donor in British political history. Many speculate that his contribution could have swayed the result.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And now, after months of painstaking inquiries by the Electoral Commission, he is the subject of a full-scale criminal probe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Banks has always denied any claims of Russian influence or wrongdoing, and of course all of us are innocent until proven guilty. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I believe that this investigation into Mr Banks is the most significant political event since the Referendum itself.</p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">This is because our system of representative democracy is built around fairness. Funding for elections should be open for all to see. The laws are there to stop big money, or secret interests, from winning power.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, shockingly, there is a suspicion that a foreign power may have been a source of funding for the Brexit campaign. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We know that Arron Banks has enjoyed many meetings with the Russian Ambassador, Alexander Yakovenko, who allegedly sent a number of business opportunities Banks’ way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And we also have reason to believe — thanks to an exemplary investigation by the website openDemocracy — that Arron Banks’ personal fortune may not be as substantial as he and supporters would have us believe. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So where did the money that Banks donated come from? We need to know.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I repeat that Arron Banks must be seen as completely innocent until, and unless, he is proven guilty. </p><img id="i-269ed17a4fb7dff8" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/02/23/05B57A66000007D0-6348317-image-a-3_1541202992185.jpg" height="375" width="634" alt="That is why, from the very start, Russia was on the side of the Brexiteers — just as Putin appears to have supported Donald Trump’s campaign in the United States" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He may yet provide a convincing and entirely innocent explanation.

Horrible things, FOBTs. They cause untold social wreckage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Five months ago Miss Crouch happily announced that FOBT stakes were going to be cut from £100 to £2. It was understood the cut would be in place by next Spring. Now the Treasury (ie that man Hammond) is insisting on a six-month delay. High stakes generate oodles of tax, you see.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Commons day began at 9.30am with Culture and Sport questions. Where was our Tracey? Not where she should have been, which was on the Government bench. Honk the klaxons. Escaped prisoner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Miss Crouch’s boss, Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright, said she had been in the US on official duties and only flown back on the red eye. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would have been ‘unwise to rely on public transport or London traffic’ to get her from the airport to the Commons in time for the start of play. Well there’s a vote on confidence in Transport Secretary Chris Grayling.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Wright’s claim was undermined when the BBC reported that Miss Crouch had been called to see the Government Whips at 9.45am. ‘Is she in the building?’ asked Labour’s Kevin Brennan. Mr Wright left that one alone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Scepticism sharpened when, 50 minutes later, during a lull for questions to the legal officers, Government Chief Whip Julian Smith materialised behind the Speaker’s Chair. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Smith shimmers like an All Souls Day wraith. Around his contours the air seems somehow to vibrate. He beckoned a bony finger at Mr Wright, summoning him outside for urgent words. This was awkward, for Mr Wright was about to face an urgent parliamentary question about the FOBTs rumpus.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tick tock. Would Mr Wright be back in time to answer his question? Yes, just, but by now he was a little pink-eared. Had Tracey committed harakiri? </p><img id="i-4288fc51e7c1fa06" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/01/18/5666444-6340413-image-a-26_1541095238242.jpg" height="280" width="634" alt="Ms Crouch said she was quitting with 'great sadness' but warned the Prime Minister delays would cost lives as two addicted gamblers kill themselves every day." class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">‘She is doing an outstanding job as a minister,’ said Mr Wright with as straight a bat as could be mustered. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We Poirots of the press gallery took note of that present tense: she was still a minister, even if her fellow junior ministers were by now pretty green. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wind down your window, Mavis. Michael and Margot look peaky. Nick Smith (Lab, Blaenau Gwent): ‘Has Miss Crouch threatened to resign?’ Mr Wright: ‘I have made it clear I think she’d doing a great job. The decision on FOBTs has to be taken collectively.’ Or ‘yes’, as normal people would say.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Conservative backbenchers tore into the delay in acting against FOBTs. Iain Duncan Smith (Chingford &amp; Woodford Green) urged the Government to ‘put lives ahead of profit’. Sir Peter Bottomley (Worthing W) called FOBTs ‘ghastly machines’. </p><img id="i-1f16f88b1fdeba73" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/01/18/5666446-6340413-image-m-30_1541095258220.jpg" height="389" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-dfd9f95069196058" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/01/18/5666448-6340413-image-a-31_1541095269864.jpg" height="389" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">David Jones (Clwyd W) accused Mr Wright of ‘pure semantics’. Philip Davies (Shipley), often seen as the bookies’ runner, was for once not present. But the Tories’ deputy Chief Whip Christopher Pincher was. He stood at the far end of the House, eyebrows as busy as knitting needles.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Carolyn Harris (Lab, Swansea E) boomed at Mr Wright, ‘don’t give me warm words - give me action!’ Steady on, old girl. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is the British Treasury you’re dealing with. Principle comes second to the Chancellor’s amour propre and Whips’ deals. When P. Hammond is involved, the despatch box becomes the lack-of-despatch box.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A farcical morning ended in an appropriate manner with the next item of business, questions to Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No sign of her!

<p class="mol-para-with-font">There's an eye-opening sequel to a column I wrote in the spring, discussing research into Grumpy Old Man Syndrome by scientists at the University of <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-f0ec7930-de41-11e8-93db-83d9bcadd477">London</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a throwaway line at the end, I happened to mention that I was feeling especially grumpy that week, because a plumber sent by Thames Water's insurance arm, HomeServe, had inadvertently left my family without mains water for three days after he'd come round to fix an overflowing tank in the loft.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As I observed at the time, my annual premium of £712.32 seemed an awful lot to pay for being forced to wash, shave and flush the loo with rainwater from the butt in the garden. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Well, on the day that column appeared in May, a very friendly woman from the Press office at HomeServe got in touch to apologise and inform me that I really needn't be paying so much for my insurance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Would I be interested, she wondered, in switching from the policy I'd had for years to the HomeServe Cover8 plan, which would cost me £480 a year for more extensive cover than I'd enjoyed up to then?</p><img id="i-c0f63519fe3be7a9" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/02/01/5678366-0-image-a-46_1541122710642.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="A plumber inadvertently left my family without mains water for three days after he came round to fix an overflowing tank in the loft (stock image) " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like, duh (if I may borrow one of the more irritating catchphrases of the young). As I've often confessed, I'm hopeless at maths. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But even I could spot that £480 was a considerably smaller sum than £712.32. By my calculations (though I stand to be corrected), it represented a saving of £232.32 per annum.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Kicked</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Add the fact that this new policy would insure me against all the risks covered by my old one, and more besides, who but a complete mug would say No?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The friendly Press officer said she'd arrange for a colleague to sign me up and — kerching! — I'm now £232.32 a year better off. I'm also covered against just about everything that could go wrong in the house, from rat and/or mice infestation to broken external doors, noisy boilers, leaking pipes and faulty wiring, with an annual boiler service thrown in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, I suppose the conclusion I'm meant to draw from my Rolls-Royce treatment is that the people at HomeServe are exceptionally nice, and keen to bend over backwards to help their most loyal customers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Call me a grumpy old cynic, but I don't see it that way. In my view, the moral of this story is that HomeServe is exceptionally kind to customers who happen to have jobs writing weekly columns in a newspaper read by millions in its print editions, and zillions more online. </p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for the rest of its clientele — and they must include one or two who aren't national newspaper columnists — well, they are there to be milked for every penny they're worth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I mean, how long would the insurers have let me go on shelling out £712.32 for inferior cover if I hadn't happened to mention it in these pages? For ever, I imagine — and they would have gone on cranking up the premiums, year after year, until I finally kicked up a fuss.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps I'm being unfair. It could be that the firm sent me bumf through the post long ago, alerting me to the fact that it had much better deals on offer. If so, it passed me by. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's also possible, I suppose, that the delightful young woman in the Press office spends her entire week ringing round loyal customers, from every walk of life, advising them to switch to Cover8.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But somehow I doubt it.</p><img id="i-f94a48d7948640cf" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/02/01/5678624-0-Richard_Harpin_chief_executive_officer_of_HomeServe_A_friendly_p-m-57_1541123163764.jpg" height="450" width="634" alt="Richard Harpin, chief executive officer of HomeServe. A friendly press officer from the firm arranged for a colleague to sign me up for new insurance so now I'm £232.32 a year better off" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">My guess is that HomeServe, like most of the rest of the insurance industry, has a deliberate policy of punishing loyalty by charging higher premiums to those long-standing customers it judges least likely to take their business elsewhere.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The motto seems to be: hook 'em with tempting introductory offers, then screw 'em for the rest of time — or at least until they start shopping around.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As anyone with any moral sense will agree, this stinks to high heaven. I'm not thinking chiefly of myself — too lazy or, as I like to think, too busy to shop around (and, all right, too comfortably off to think it worth the bother).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No, my sympathies lie with elderly people and others who may be unfamiliar with the internet and don't know how to navigate their way through the maze of price comparison websites.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Oppressed</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Too often they put their trust in established names, thinking that companies jealous of their reputations wouldn't dream of ripping anyone off — least of all their most loyal customers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even I — the least trusting of souls — had idiotically assumed that £712.32, steep though it undoubtedly seemed, was the going rate for the sort of cover I wanted. As it turned out, HomeServe was just trying it on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like countless others, therefore, I rejoiced this week when the Financial Conduct Authority announced an investigation into the pricing structure of the insurance industry, so long campaigned for by those tireless champions of the exploited and oppressed, my colleagues on Money Mail.</p><img id="i-f7a43e2c4a264281" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/02/01/5678438-0-image-m-48_1541122764435.jpg" height="497" width="634" alt="Kim Lewis bought her home insurance from Prudential for almost 30 years until she received a renewal quote of £568 last August, which was an increase from £470 in 2014" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Warning that people are at risk of being seriously disadvantaged by hidden pricing practices, the watchdog says that not enough is being done to protect vulnerable customers — while the worst exploited are those of us who stay with the same car or home insurance firm, year after year. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to some estimates, this loyalty penalty racket costs households a breathtaking £4 billion a year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Take the case of Kim Lewis, 56, a cash office assistant who had insured her three-bedroom semi in Gloucester with the Prudential for almost 30 years until she received a renewal quote of £568 last August — up from £470 in 2014.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When she rang the Pru to question the premium, she was told she need pay only £330. As she told yesterday's Mail: 'I couldn't believe it. A 40 per cent discount, just like that?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Showing a great deal more wisdom than me, she then rang round other providers — two of which offered her the same cover for less than £190 — before settling for the AA, which quoted £185. 'I have been a customer of Prudential since 1988,' she said. 'This smacks of sharp practice and it leaves a very sour taste in the mouth.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I couldn't put it better myself.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Gullible</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What makes it so much worse is that we in Britain are particularly ripe for exploitation. Used to fixed prices in the shops, we have no culture of haggling — and most of us are pretty bad at it. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We've also grown accustomed to being rewarded for loyalty, whether with Nectar card points for regulars at the local supermarket or air miles for frequent fliers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But in the insurance industry, the very opposite seems to apply: the more loyal we are, the more outrageously we're overcharged. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And when fixing our premiums, firms don't merely assess us for risk, according to our driving record or whether or not we live in burglary hotspots. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They also take into account how gullible they think we may be, and how likely or unlikely we are to take our business elsewhere.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Isn't this all the more extraordinary, since the financial sector's prosperity through the ages has been built entirely on the City's reputation for impeccable integrity and trustworthiness?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, the very vocabulary of the industry hinges on dependability — words such as 'credit', 'bonds', 'trust funds' and 'mutual assurance'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">True, this began to change with the financial crash and the PPI scandal, when some of us started to wonder if we could ever trust the City again. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what is surely clear is that the sector must re-establish its good name PDQ if it is to prosper after Brexit. If the FCA's probe into insurance pricing helps clean up the sector, then more power to its elbow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A brief footnote: I feel a little bad about picking on HomeServe, the only insurance company that has ever done me a personal favour. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But when researching this column, I looked up Cover8 on the internet, where I discover that the policy is now on offer for a mere £216 in the first year (admittedly with a £60 excess per claim).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The company's website goes on: 'The price will be different for existing and returning customers.' Don't you just love that word 'different'?</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>After feeling especially grumpy because a plumber sent by Thames Water’s insurance arm, HomeServe, had inadvertently left my family without mains water for three days after he’d come round to fix an overflowing tank in the loft.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Here's your starter for ten. What have Basil Brush, the pop song Kung Fu Fighting, and former Home Secretary Amber Rudd got in common?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Answer: they've all been investigated by the police for 'hate crime'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the case of Basil Brush, Northamptonshire Plod spent hours studying the video of an episode featuring a gipsy fortune-teller, after a complaint from a self-appointed 'community leader' that it was 'racist and offensive' to members of the notoriously law-abiding travelling community.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the Isle of Wight, a beach-bar singer performing the 1974 novelty hit Kung Fu Fighting was arrested and accused of 'racially aggravated harassment'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Someone of Chinese origin claimed to be offended by the lyrics and complained to the Old Bill, who took the singer into custody and interviewed him under caution.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And in 2016, Amber Rudd was investigated over a speech about the status of foreign workers, which she made to the Tory conference in Birmingham. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some obscure, disgruntled Left-wing lecturer complained to West Midlands police that she was inciting hatred against immigrants.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After extensive inquiries, a crack team of detectives concluded that no actual criminal offence had been committed, but her remarks would be recorded as a 'non-crime hate incident'.</p><img id="i-cd39bea4443be7a9" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/02/01/5677826-0-image-a-28_1541120680643.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd was investigated over a speech about the status of foreign workers, which she made to the Tory conference in Birmingham" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">At the time, I remarked that it would take a heart of stone not to laugh, since Rudd herself had been responsible for the Home Office guidelines which led to this ridiculous complaint being taken seriously.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These arbitrary rules reinforced the previous Labour government's lazily drafted definition of a hate crime as: 'Any incident . . . which is perceived by the victim or any other person [my italics] as being motivated by prejudice or hate.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tony Blair's 2003 Criminal Justice Act was one of the most sinister pieces of legislation ever introduced, since for the first time it made a specific crime a matter of opinion, not fact.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It gave licence to all manner of embittered, politically motivated zealots to make vexatious criminal complaints against anyone of whom they disapproved. Needless to say, ambitious police chiefs embraced the new law with unbridled enthusiasm, anxious to appease their political asters and burnish their promotion prospects.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The three so-called hate crimes which I have singled out here, all of which appeared in this column, are simply pebbles in an avalanche of activism-driven investigations and prosecutions, which have escalated exponentially over the past decade. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the last year alone, more than 94,000, increasingly ludicrous, alleged hate crimes have been recorded.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the same time, police forces — sorry 'services' — have turned their backs on burglary, robbery and violent disorder, closing police stations and withdrawing from the streets to spend their days playing Keystroke Kops and trawling the internet for 'inappropriate' remarks. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I've been writing about warped police priorities for the past three decades, but the crisis has worsened alarmingly in recent years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For instance, 12 months ago it was revealed that Devon and Cornwall Police had no officers available to answer 999 calls, because they were all attached to specialist units. Yet in the week this news emerged, the very same constabulary announced it would be setting up a new directorate aimed at tackling hate crime.</p><img id="i-19ae64d4a9893614" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/02/01/5677938-0-image-a-30_1541120762777.jpg" height="424" width="634" alt="Basil Brush was investigated by Northamptonshire Police after an episode featuring a gipsy fortune-teller, after a complaint from a ‘community leader’ that it was ‘racist and offensive’" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Next door, Avon and Somerset Police actually disbanded its burglary squad, after managing to solve just ten per cent of 70,552 reported break-ins and failing to recover £40 million worth of stolen property.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shortly afterwards, they unveiled a new initiative to crack down on 'gender-based hate crime'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Barely a day goes by without yet another story about one police force or another refusing to investigate burglaries. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This week, one of them was advising householders to hunt for their own stolen property on eBay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over the years, I've received thousands of letters and emails complaining about police indifference and incompetence — a considerable proportion from both serving and retired coppers, horrified at the dereliction of duty and political posturing of senior officers.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">So you might expect me to join the chorus of approval which has greeted this week's speech from Sara Thornton, chairman of the National Police Chiefs Council.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At a conference in London, she said police should concentrate on burglary and violent crime, instead of pursuing fashionable new hate crimes such as wolf-whistling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sorry, include me out for now. Not even one cheer. I'll believe it when I see it. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is the same Sara Thornton who three years ago told the BBC that because of the savage Tory cuts, people couldn't expect the Old Bill to respond to every burglary. They had more important things to do.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nothing is going to change without political will. There's not the remotest sign of that, even from a nominally Tory government.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's only a couple of weeks since the current Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, said he wanted to broaden the definition of hate crime to include ageism and misogyny, as well as extending the law to protect goths and punks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And this madness from a man often tipped to be the next Conservative leader, and possibly Prime Minister. Heaven help us.</p><img id="i-1f9b0bf34311f80" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/02/01/5677868-0-image-a-29_1541120735893.jpg" height="616" width="634" alt="Sara Thornton said police should concentrate on burglary and violent crime, instead of pursuing new hate crimes such as wolf-whistling" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anyway, Sajid's a bit late. Manchester Police beat him to it by six years, including 'metallers and emos' alongside goths and punks. I can recall joking at the time that it was now an offence to hate the Sex Pistols.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After this week's Waitrose nonsense, he'll probably have to add vegans to the list, something I predicted two years ago. You couldn't make it up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There's even been a suggestion that men should become a protected species. If that happens, the whole concept of hate crime will become not just meaningless, but redundant. Sanity will not return until the hate crime statute is repealed altogether.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I wouldn't hold your breath. This week, while Sara Thornton was on her hind legs promising a change of direction, the Home Office was launching yet another grandstanding, anti-hate crime campaign, costing £1.5 million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to the official press release, it aims 'to help the public understand hate crime, particularly offences which often people do not recognise as criminal'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In other words, criminalise something which most sensible people don't even consider to be a crime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, after Sara Thornton's bold words this week, can we soon expect a similar campaign against burglars? What do you think?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We've more chance of seeing Basil Brush singing Kung Fu Fighting on prime time TV.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Boom, boom! </p><img id="i-cd18f36f9f80869c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/02/01/5678080-0-image-m-43_1541121352373.jpg" height="493" width="634" alt="Asif Zubairy is ITV's head of commissioning for comedy and entertainment,  dressed up as a Saudi executioner at Jonathan Ross's Halloween party" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Jonathan Ross's Halloween party</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We've had some gloriously tasteless fancy dress stories, from the late footballer Gary Speed to tragic Baby P.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">This is the story of a British industry that consistently deceives and disappoints its customers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It encourages them to run up thousands of pounds worth of debt to buy its products, which often turn out to have been wildly mis-sold.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The more this industry sells, the more it dilutes their quality. It treats its workers like drudges, loading them with paperwork and making it impossible for them to give their customers the care they need. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet it pays its bosses eye-watering salaries, far in excess of their counterparts in similar industries.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If this industry were an independent business, the Government could be forgiven for shrugging its shoulders. But it is not.</p><img id="i-5b3b570abd424a15" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/01/23/5636864-0-image-a-1_1541115727376.jpg" height="427" width="634" alt="DOMINIC SANDBROOK admits that he doesn't feel much sympathy after reports of three British universities facing bankruptcy (file photo)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is heavily subsidised by the British taxpayer, whose money is diverted into ever-grander buildings and ever more extravagant rewards for the bosses, even as its customers feel more and more cheated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The industry in question, of course, is British higher education.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So when I read that three unnamed British universities, one in the North-West and two on the South Coast, are in danger of bankruptcy, I was not entirely sorry.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, bankruptcy would be awful for the institutions' students and staff, the majority of whom are utterly blameless. But the plain fact is that something has gone desperately wrong with our universities.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And instead of throwing good money after bad, the Government should seize this opportunity to end the era of reckless expansion, and have a long think about how they can best serve Britain's youngsters rather than betray them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To put it bluntly, there are too many universities, too many degrees and too many students. In the late Eighties, when I was a teenager, fewer than 800,000 people a year — 15 per cent of school-leavers — went to university.</p><img id="i-ed0555672d412c70" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/01/23/5636862-0-image-a-2_1541115741356.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="He says that there are too many universities in Britain, too many students and too many 'tin-pot degrees'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today, some 49 per cent of school-leavers go into higher education before the age of 30. We now have 160 universities or further education colleges, employing 400,000 people and educating a staggering 2.3 million people.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ever since the Blair years — it was New Labour that settled, arbitrarily it seems, on a target of getting 50 per cent of school-leavers into university — politicians have cited these figures as signs of great progress.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They never stop to ask if we should really be encouraging youngsters to spend three of their most vigorous years studying 'body contour fashion', 'tournament golf' or 'beauty promotion', all of which are current degrees. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nor do they ask themselves if it is ethical to send graduates into the world burdened with average debts of £50,000 each — the highest rate in the Western world — in exchange for a degree that is often barely worth the paper it is written on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you talk to almost any academic in Britain, they will tell you that something is desperately wrong. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Almost without exception, they say that their classes are too crowded and there is increasingly limited opportunity for lectures and tutorials, while managers are putting them under pressure to dumb down because of the numbers of students admitted who cannot intellectually cope.</p><div class="item">

His friend explained that it had been 'pound a pint' night in the student union the night before, so I embarked on a mini-lecture instead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And as I droned on, a thought hit me. Why are they all here? What are they getting out of it?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I can already hear the howls from university managers. According to their adverts, university gives students unique 'transferable skills'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Graduates, they claim, will earn a 'premium' of £100,000 over their lifetime, thanks to a degree certificate. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first of these points is, to be frank, a complete lie. A history degree gives you no skills that you would not get from a degree in plenty of other subjects.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It certainly gives you little that you would not also get from A-level studies, training in all kinds of white-collar jobs, or just reading a book and being a reasonably intelligent adult.</p><div class="item">

I hate to sound cynical, but do they seriously expect anyone to believe this?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for the supposed premium, this is largely illusory. In reality, thousands of graduates leave every year to find themselves manning the machines in a coffee bar or pestering people to change their electricity supplier. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Figures from the Office of National Statistics show that five years after leaving university, graduates in popular subjects such as English, agriculture, and psychology actually earn less than the national average.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-dfb9b900-de2f-11e8-8f8c-532e475e59a7">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> In reality, thousands of graduates leave every year to find themselves manning the machines in a coffee bar or pestering people to change their electricity supplier</div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have a passion for Emily Bronte and excellent A-level results, by all means do an English degree. But what if you don't? Why waste three years doing something you are only mildly interested in and have never shone at?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If they had an ounce of social responsibility, the universities would encourage less academic youngsters to get an apprenticeship instead, or to find a niche in the world of work.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But they don't. In reality, they welcome all comers with the beaming smile of a used-car salesman. No matter how ill-equipped you may be for university life, there is always an institution willing to take your money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the Universities of Bedfordshire, Leeds Trinity and London Metropolitan, you can stroll in with three Cs at A-level. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, such is their greed and desperation that weaker establishments will admit students with a handful of Ds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a result, thousands of students, utterly unsuited for academic life, are packed into lecture halls like steerage passengers on the Titanic. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They find their experience intimidating, overwhelming and deeply disappointing — and all this at a cost of £9,250 a year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No wonder, then, so many give up. Nationwide dropout rates after the first year have soared for three years in a row. London Metropolitan lost a staggering 19.5 per cent of its students after the first year. Bolton lost 17 per cent; Middlesex 16 per cent.</p><div class="item">

By contrast, the other university in Cambridge is No. 1.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To make matters worse, our universities are simultaneously prostituting themselves to foreign students who sometimes can barely speak a word of English.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ten years ago, the London School of Economics notoriously awarded the son of the late Colonel Gaddafi a doctorate, despite the fact that, according to his tutor, he was 'totally uninterested in economics, lacked the intellectual depth to study at that level, and showed no willingness to read, let alone do coursework'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But this was not an aberration. This is now the norm. The LSE's only crime was to get caught.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A few years ago, I talked to a senior academic at a redbrick university who was just back from Kurdistan. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His job, he told me, was to identify poor countries that had recently suffered wars or disasters and been given aid money by the UN or the EU. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His mission was to get his hands on that money.

The True Story of Mr Blobby</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This 1995 biopic charts the troubled childhood of the iconic Eighties star Mr Blobby, his early struggles and triumphant rise to the top of the UK charts, followed by his tragic descent into drink and drugs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I wanted to capture the side of Blobby no one ever knew,’ explains screenwriter Peter Morgan. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘To the public, he was the happy-go-lucky figure with the ready grin and jiggling eyes, but to his friends he was this deeply disturbed individual who had to wrestle with his demons.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In one of the most harrowing early scenes, 13-year-old Cedric Blobby is taken to the doctor by his mother, Esmerelda Blobby (Judi Dench).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I’ve always felt somehow . . . I don’t know . . . different from other people’, he confesses to the doctor (Morgan Freeman). After a full examination, Freeman tells him he has good news and bad news. Bravely, Blobby asks for the bad news first.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Well, son, I’ve examined your skin and — forgive me, there’s no easy way to say this — it’s entirely pink with yellow dots. Not only that, son, but you’re bald, obese, you have no thumbs and no toes, and the only words you ever utter are “Blobby-blobby-blobby”.’</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">This represents a shattering blow for the young Blobby. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs Blobby is called in, and the doctor chokes back his tears while she hugs her beloved son. ‘Could you give us a few moments, doc?’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alone with his mother, the young Blobby plunges into a spiral of heartache and despair. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I’ll never amount to anything, Mom! Not like this! Not with my skin all pink with yellow dots!’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He then turns on his mother, poking her with his bulbous fingers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘And why did you never buy me any clothes to wear, Mom? No wonder folks always looked at me kinda odd! Jist look at me, Mom — I’m NAKED, goddammit!’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He breaks down, and falls into her arms.</p><img id="i-6005ce7242d96bc3" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/29/15/5538298-6329391-image-m-15_1540827491684.jpg" height="856" width="634" alt="Queen, pictured in 1973. Bohemian Rhapsody is a new film about lead singer Freddie Mercury" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs Blobby pats him reassuringly, telling him that, come what may, she’ll always believe in him. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Follow your dreams, son,’ she says. ‘And be the Blobby you’ve always wanted to be.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is a knock on the door. It is the doctor. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘And now for the good news,’ he says. ‘Top TV personality Noel Edmonds (John Malkovich) wants you for the second series of House Party.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He says they’ve been looking high and low for someone who looks and behaves like you! Yes, son, you’re going to be a... star!’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And so it proves. Mr Blobby becomes a household name, ushered to the best tables in restaurants and welcomed at all the hottest showbiz events.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But with success comes jealousy from unexpected quarters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Blobby notices his one-time mentor Noel Edmonds is strangely silent, even reproachful. </p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">In a key scene, Blobby overhears a conversation between Edmonds and their TV producer (Jason Robards).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Are you really telling me you wanna make me the sidekick to that great fat pink and yellow freak?’ screams Edmonds. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘You must be stark, staring CRAZY! Tell me I’m not hearing this!’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The audience has turned against you, Noel. They used to love you, but they’ve grown irritated by your silly little beard and your brightly coloured shirts, and are repelled by your know-it-all manner. They want someone who’s easier in his own body — someone just like . . . Blobby.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Someone, somewhere, starts to leak vicious stories to the Press about Blobby’s nights of passion in a West End hotel with two Teletubbies, and his increasing dependence on alcohol and drugs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Soon, Blobby reaches rock bottom, and starts fluffing his lines on prime-time television. His producer is furious. ‘Damn you, Blobby — you were meant to say “Blobby-blobby-blobby” but you just said, “Blobby-blobby” and then you fell over! Screw it up one more time, and that’s it! Never forget this, Blobby — I made you —and I can break you!’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Matt Damon gives a stunning Oscar-winning performance in the title role. However, some critics felt that the see-sawing relationship between Mr Blobby and Noel Edmonds strayed too close to the plot of A Star Is Born. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The film performed poorly at the box office, but has since become a cult classic.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>CRAIG BROWN: The release of Bohemian Rhapsody, the new film about Freddie Mercury, offers the perfect opportunity to reassess the greatest showbiz biopics of all time.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Here behind the Westminster ramparts, Speaker Bercow let PMQs dribble 20 minutes over time. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is when Bercow's cruelty becomes most apparent. To extend such a dull event is the act of a hellbent goblin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Commons ached to be free.

Yet the moth failed to knock itself senseless. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Poor creature, it could still hear Dame Caroline Spelman (Con, Meriden) warbling about a visit to London by a choir of German politicians. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And so the little creature did a small circuit and again flew at that strut, repeating its head-on collision. After that I saw my moth no more.</p><img id="i-1a2d1ac0dd43fb96" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/01/00/5636584-6340199-image-a-1_1541031790227.jpg" height="341" width="634" alt="Here behind the Westminster ramparts, Speaker John Bercow (pictured) let PMQs dribble 20 minutes over time, writes QUENTIN LETTS " class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">By recent measures, yesterday's PMQs was actually one of the better ones, at least in its main exchanges. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn had their weekly grapple, Mrs May taking the bout with ease.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Corbyn tried to establish the slogan 'a broken-promise Budget' but made the mistake of mentioning Budget tax cuts that have split the Labour Party like a pair of Oliver Hardy's trousers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May capitalised on those Labour disagreements. Mr Corbyn should make up his mind and support the Budget, averred Mrs May. Big Tory hurrahs. Mr Corbyn narrowed his eyes. It was the look of a man accepting a suppository.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the next exchange Mrs May had her loyalists chanting 'up! up! up!' in response to a list of things she said the Government had achieved (support for public services, growth, wages). Much mooing from Tories. Labour MPs looked a bit 'uh-oh'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But that was the best of it. Much of the rest was stodgy fare, not least because Mrs May was so stuttery, her delivery jagged and indecisive. </p><img id="i-b52d18ad46347984" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/01/00/5636586-6340199-image-a-2_1541031793739.jpg" height="328" width="634" alt="Pictured: Prime Minister Theresa May addresses MPs at Prime Minister's Questions yesterday" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">At such moments she could be Barbara Edwards, who did BBC TV weather forecasts in the 1970s. Do you remember Barbara? Neat, correct vowels, decent sort, but prone to frightful mid-sentence gulps.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a week which has seen the election of a sharply Right-wing president in Brazil and the crumbling of Germany's Chancellor, you might have expected Tom Tugendhat (Con) to raise foreign policy. After all, he chairs the select committee on foreign affairs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead he talked about, er, home-spun poppies. This led us into an excruciating minute when Mrs May chewed over the different types of Remembrance poppy one can wear.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Amber Rudd (Con, anti-Brexit) jawed about a sauce-manufacturer in her constituency. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Peter Bone (Con, pro-Brexit) had a question of such strained prolixity, it had onlookers shrugging to one another in bafflement. Chuka Umunna (Lab, Streatham) wanted money for black cultural archives.</p><img id="i-372d19763e4f954a" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/01/00/5636580-6340199-image-a-3_1541031799521.jpg" height="398" width="634" alt="The Commons ached to be free.

Pictured: MPs gather for PMQs yesterday " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Victoria Prentis (Con, Banbury) publicised a charity concert she is helping to organise. Cornishman Steve Double (Con) talked of space exploration.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mark Francois (Con, Rayleigh &amp; Wickford) caused a flicker of panic on the Government bench by again demanding that Whitehall stop persecuting Army veterans with investigations about long-distant service in Northern Ireland. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Francois urged Mrs May to 'defend those who defended us' and bawled at her, directly, 'are you with us?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May, startled, stalled through some civil service bluster. Her appalling ineloquence and her reliance on officialdom's blame-dodging advice spoke volumes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The treatment of those Army veterans is widely opposed yet senior civil servants persist with it. Across the land, black-metal silhouette figures are being erected to remind us of the gallant dead. What about gallant survivors?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The final question, from doughty Philip Davies (Con, Shipley), offered more of the same. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why was spending on overseas aid rising faster than spending on 'hard-pressed schools and police and fire services'? Most people, said Mr Davies, thought 'this warped priority crazy crackers'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed so. But our political elite snootily regards the electorate as 'crazy crackers', and eminently easy to ignore.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>QUENTIN LETTS: Here behind the Westminster ramparts, Speaker Bercow let PMQs dribble 20 minutes over time.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Given any opportunity, <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/jeremy_corbyn/index.html" id="mol-1737d970-dd6d-11e8-aea0-a93d43da2e1d">Jeremy Corbyn</a> will accuse the Tory Government of doling out ‘tax cuts to the rich’. So will his comrade-in-arms John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The contention is untrue, but is repeated so frequently and with such assurance I suspect many quite sensible people now believe the Tories are surreptitiously feathering the nests of the wealthy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is a baseless allegation, calculated to fuel the politics of envy and reignite class warfare. But after years of cutbacks and stagnant wages, it amounts to a potent claim.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Corbyn was at it again on Monday, when in reply to <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/philip-hammond/index.html" id="mol-17398720-dd6d-11e8-aea0-a93d43da2e1d">Philip Hammond</a>’s Budget speech he condemned ‘tax cuts for the super-rich’. As usual the Labour leader was on automatic pilot, and didn’t pay any attention to what the Chancellor had actually said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The following morning the Resolution Foundation was given prime billing by the BBC for its judgment that the Budget will ‘overwhelmingly benefit richer households’. Auntie accorded this finding the status of holy writ.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, what the Left-leaning think tank asserted was largely misleading. This was not a Budget for either the rich or the quite well-off. It contained, as some commentators have noted, many measures that might have fallen naturally from Corbyn’s lips.</p><img id="i-6924024b06db2f8f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/01/00/5636656-0-image-a-15_1541031785840.jpg" height="490" width="634" alt="Jeremy Corbyn repeatedly accused the Tory Government of doling out ‘tax cuts to the rich’" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The next time the Beeb invokes the Resolution Foundation as the fount of objective truth, it might mention that its director is Torsten Bell, previously Ed Miliband’s head of policy. Bell was also architect of the fatuous ‘EdStone’ — the 8ft tombstone engraved with six pledges for the 2015 general election.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let me enumerate a few of the measures unveiled in the Budget which are intended to help poorer people, and seem likely to have exactly that effect.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most obviously, an extra £6.6 billion will be spent on Universal Credit over the next five years to deal with glitches in the new social security payment. It will assist 2.4 million working families and those with disabilities to the tune of an extra £630 a year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile the national living wage will go up by 4.9 per cent to £8.21 an hour, more than the rate of inflation. The threshold at which people will start paying tax will increase from £11,850 to £12,500 in April, a year earlier than planned.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there are measures which, although not exclusively aimed at the poor, are bound to benefit them along with everyone else. Chief among these is the planned extra expenditure of £20.5 billion on the NHS over the next five years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Less well-off people will also share the gains of extra defence expenditure, new mental health crisis centres and repairs to potholes. The reduction of a third in business rates over two years for firms with a rateable value of less than £51,000 is hardly going to enrich fat cats.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nor is there any reason to suppose that the poorer will object to a special new tax on big technology companies which have shown themselves reluctant to pay their dues.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Where, one must ask, are the special perks which might quicken the pulses of richer people? Capital gains tax has not been reduced. Higher tax rates remain unchanged, as does inheritance tax. Stamp Duty, which was most unwisely hiked by George Osborne, Mr Hammond’s predecessor, has been left untouched.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is, in fact, only one area where the better-off might consider themselves a little fortunate — namely the raising of the thresholds at which people start paying tax at 20 and 40 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But here too a lot of tripe has been spouted by Labour and the Resolution Foundation. The prospective annual saving is modest even for higher earners.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Moreover, the huge number of people who don’t pay any income tax at all — some 43 per cent of all working-age adults — can hardly complain if they aren’t beneficiaries of rising income tax thresholds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In any case, it now transpires that nearly half of the average annual £730 tax break handed to millions of workers will be snatched back by the Treasury in the form of higher national insurance contributions. Mr Hammond sneakily omitted to mention this on Monday.</p><div class="item">

The one bonus offered to some turns out to be vanishingly small. How on earth can Jeremy Corbyn fulminate about ‘tax cuts for the super-rich’?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is perfectly true that the real super-rich — the handful of people with assets of at least £20 million — are often adept at minimising their tax burden. By contrast, the merely well-off dutifully pay their share, which has been rising.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to the independent-minded Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), those who earn £54,000 a year or more (i.e. the top ten per cent) now contribute nearly 60 per cent of all income tax revenues. This richest tenth of the population has borne the brunt of tax increases since 2015, claims the Treasury.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So the oft-repeated assertion of Corbyn and McDonnell that the Tory Government has been disproportionately hammering the disadvantaged is simply not correct.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Furthermore, Labour’s frequent claim that the gap between the rich and poor has been widening under the Tories is also false, says the IFS. Income inequality fell sharply after the Great Recession of 2007-2008, and has barely changed since then.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How should the Tories deal with the lies of the Corbynistas? Other than exposing them wherever possible, there is little they can do other than hope the general public will eventually see through them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the Government’s fear of being wrongly accused by Labour of aiding and abetting the rich has had unfortunate repercussions in one case —namely Stamp Duty, which is payable on house purchases.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2014 George Osborne yanked up this tax in the belief that it would dampen down the then overheated housing market.

]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Given any opportunity, Jeremy Corbyn (pictured) will accuse the Tory Government of doling out ‘tax cuts to the rich’. So will his comrade-in-arms John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor. The contention is untrue, but is repeated so frequently and with such assurance I suspect many quite sensible people now believe the Tories are surreptitiously feathering the nests of the wealthy. It is a baseless allegation, calculated to fuel the politics of envy and reignite class warfare. But after years of cutbacks and stagnant wages, it amounts to a potent claim.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Stephen Glover for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-11-01T23:07:48.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>How rich for Corbyn to claim the Budget was for the wealthy</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-11-01T23:07:48.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/01/00/5636656-0-image-a-27_1541032013805.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1146016</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>PA</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6338449/Dominic-Raab-says-expects-Brexit-deal-THREE-WEEKS.html" title="Brexit BREAKTHROUGH?

<p class="mol-para-with-font">William Sitwell probably didn’t mean to be quite so rude to the journalist who wanted him to run a vegan recipe series. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m sure his reply was an over-the-top flight of fancy, designed to elicit an amusing response.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Thanks for this. How about a series on killing vegans?’ the editor of Waitrose Food magazine’s asked freelancer Selene Nelson before continuing in a similarly withering vein.</p><img id="i-67865e6245a60ec1" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/01/00/5636808-6340073-image-m-2_1541032662057.jpg" height="520" width="634" alt="Becoming a vegan is a very demanding, life-consuming business, like becoming a monk or joining a cult, writes James " class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-a4435b099bb138d8" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/31/23/5635644-6340073-image-a-12_1541029340174.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="‘Plant-based cooking’, as it’s now trendily known – presumably because ‘vegan’ sounds a bit ugly and unfriendly – is all the rage" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Ms Nelson decided to go public with their private email exchange and tell the world, and Sitwell’s employer, how thoroughly offended she was. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Well, of course she did. It’s just the kind of prissy, sanctimonious, humourless thing a vegan would do.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now before anyone accuses me of carnivorous prejudice, let me say in my defence that I’m a vegan, too. Just not a permanent one, I hope.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’ve been put on a vegan diet for medical reasons, in order – so my dietician tells me – to create the best anti-inflammatory, alkaline environment for my recent stem-cell therapy treatment for Lyme disease. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I’ve been a vegan long enough – two months and counting – to be able to see both sides of the debate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the one hand, I’ve learned why vegans get so cross and defensive. </p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">On the other, I do also understand why ominivores find them so annoying and mildly threatening.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s a joke about vegans which goes: ‘Q. How do you know someone is a vegan? A. Don’t worry – they’ll tell you!’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes it’s cruel but also probably true. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Becoming a vegan is a very demanding, life-consuming business, like becoming a monk or joining a cult. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The upside is that it lends a purpose and a bracing rigour to your daily existence. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The downside is that you do spend an awful lot more time thinking – and telling anyone who’ll listen – about your diet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not only are you hungrier than you used to be (no matter how many lentils and nuts you eat to fill the protein gap, they’re still no substitute for a bacon sarnie), but you also have to dedicate much more time to sourcing and preparing your food.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can’t just nip to the fridge and fill up with a bit of cheese, either. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So it’s a bit like what my late friend Mike told me about his time as a prisoner of war in Italy: your whole day revolves around meal times.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is why vegans tend mainly to hang out with their own kind. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A bit like vampires – only without the blood element, obviously – they exist on the margins of society, cursed (or blessed as they prefer to see it) by their dietary restrictions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When they go to a restaurant, the only bit of the menu they can read are the words with ‘VG’ next to them (which stands for ‘Vegan’ not ‘Very Good’). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When they go to a food chain like Eat or Pret A Manger, about the only option available to them is the box containing salad, bits of beetroot, green beans and hummus. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Believe me, I’ve got very used to that box in its various permutations. </p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s delicious and no doubt terribly good for you, but it does become a little wearing once you’ve had it a few days in a row.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The same is true of vegan recipes generally: once you’ve banished cheese and meat (not to mention butter and cream) your palette is almost as limited as if you’d chucked out all the colours and decided to paint only in black.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, I’m sure if you had a vegan private chef he or she could work wonders. But most of us aren’t millionaires.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So here’s what you usually end up eating: curry, curry and more curry, usually made with coconut milk – which non-vegans think of as a rare treat, but which for vegans becomes a somewhat relentless staple. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You learn to eat your breakfast muesli or porridge with almond or hemp milk. You have a salad for lunch. Or vegetables. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And that’s it, day in day out, forever, if you’re planning on doing this thing permanently.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, there’s no doubt that things are a lot better than they were. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Plant-based cooking’, as it’s now trendily known – presumably because ‘vegan’ sounds a bit ugly and unfriendly – is all the rage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lots of millennials are embracing it, stars like ‘Deliciously Ella’ Mills and the boys behind the bestselling Bosh cookbook are making money from it, and restaurants and food shops are getting better at catering for it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You’d think they’d be grateful for this increasingly vegan-friendly culture. But not a bit of it – it has just made them more demanding and militant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Vegan Society, for example, is lobbying the government to make it illegal for caterers not to provide a vegan option. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And as soon as Sitwell’s comments became public, vegans were clamouring for him to be sacked – which he was, of course. </p><img id="i-23b55b0b2e582feb" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/29/17/5544004-6329981-image-a-8_1540834840545.jpg" height="430" width="306" alt="Nelson was shocked when Sitwell responded to her pitch by suggesting a series on killing vegans" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-916e50d0fdaf711d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/29/17/5544008-6329981-image-m-7_1540834834424.jpg" height="430" width="306" alt="Nelson was shocked when Sitwell responded to her pitch by suggesting a series on killing vegans" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">One email that pinged into my inbox was from the Humane Society with a letter from its executive director Claire Bass, demanding that Sitwell be dismissed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘As a vegan myself and as the mother of a vegan child, I want my son to grow up in a world where hateful, violent language aimed at our lifestyle choice and beliefs are not accepted,’ she pontificates.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Well I’m sorry but this kind of hectoring, holier-than-thou tone is precisely why some people find vegans so eminently mockable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, anti-vegan prejudice can be annoying sometimes. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I do hate it, for example, when I’ve posted a picture on social media of some delicious vegan dish I’ve prepared – something from Ottolenghi maybe – and all I get is rude remarks from carnivores about what revolving slop it looks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But if you’re going to choose an alternative lifestyle, I’d say you should learn to smile at the brickbats, rather than spend your whole time in a state of fulminating grievance and self-righteous victimhood.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s not altogether clear to me, in any case, that vegans are really in a position to claim the moral high ground over the rest of society. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, of course, I appreciate their respect for animal welfare, and I understand the potential health benefits, but I’m less convinced when they try telling us that they’re doing it to save the planet. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Really? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In California, the explosion in demand for that almond milk I mentioned earlier is causing tremendous environmental damage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to one expert it takes 1,611 US gallons of water (in a state where water is scarce) to make one litre of almond milk. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Farmers are ripping down biodiverse citrus groves and replacing them with almond trees to feed this insatiable demand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are similar problems with another hipster vegan staple, the avocado. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In California, where again most of them are grown, it takes 72 gallons of water to grow a pound of avocados.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Mexico, where they are known as ‘green gold’, they are often grown in areas controlled by violent drug cartels, which profit outrageously from the protection money they demand from farmers, who are murdered if they resist.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there’s quinoa – a superfood grain that few of us had heard of until a decade ago but which is now a must for vegans. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Such is the growth in demand that people in Peru and Bolivia, who’ve been relying on its low-fat, high-protein nutrition for centuries, have been priced out of the market and can no longer afford it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, I accept that there are environmental costs to meat-eating, too. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The difference is that carnivores don’t keep banging on about how selfless and noble they are every time they tuck into a juicy steak.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Vegans, on the other hand, really do seem to imagine that they’re on a higher moral plane; and that furthermore, the only right thing to do is for everyone else to join them.</p><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">This mildly sinister, proselytising side of veganism was brought home to me when I bought a carton of Oatly oat drink and noticed on the side, the legend: ‘You are one of us now!’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m sure it was meant as a jokey piece of marketing. But lurking underneath is an unpleasant ‘them and us’ divisiveness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And I’m really not sure I appreciate this almost Marxist politicising from my ordinary supermarket products.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My enforced stint on a vegan diet has given me a lot of sympathy for the rigours vegans endure; it has helped me lose weight, and all that extra salad and veg it forces you to eat has definitely made me a lot healthier.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I’d hate to have to live in a world where everyone ate that way – which is, I fear, many vegans’ ultimate goal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe if they want to be treated with more tolerance they should learn to be more tolerant themselves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Oh, and get a sense of humour: that wouldn’t hurt, either.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>JAMES DELINGPOLE: My enforced stint on a vegan diet has given me a lot of sympathy for the rigours vegans endure; it has helped me lose weight, and all that extra salad and veg it forces you to eat has definitely made me a lot healthier.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Frankly, it was one of the most patronising lines heard in a Budget speech for a long time. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/philip-hammond/index.html" id="mol-36b18ac0-dcb0-11e8-bd85-4d741a89f7cb">Philip Hammond</a>, admitting classroom finances were stretched, declared that he was announcing a £400 million bonus ‘to help our schools buy the little extras they need’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In one glib Budget phrase, the Chancellor managed to infuriate an influential chunk of the electorate while underlining the hollowness of talk on ending austerity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When schools are begging parents to help fund computers and textbooks, this was barely enough to give pupils a new set of pencils — and less than Hammond gave councils to fill in a few potholes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, crime is rising, cities are becoming more violent, MPs are pressing for cash to help protect public safety — yet hard-pressed police received nothing beyond £160m for those fighting terrorism.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prisons are in terrible crisis — yet the justice department budget is being cut.

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">But one slab of spending grew substantially bigger as always — the sums frittered away on foreign aid, which continued their inexorable surge with an extra £230m set to be sprayed around the world next year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So the total given away by Britain will top £14bn — enough to fund 2,166 nurses for every English hospital trust, 90 teachers for every secondary school or to build enough social housing for a new city the size of Liverpool.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alternatively, given the international tensions, those billions taken from beleaguered taxpayers to make politicians look compassionate could double the number of troops in our depleted forces with enough change for 160 new tanks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ministers like to argue they are tackling welfare dependency, pressing on with their controversial universal credit scheme — yet even some African leaders point out they are fostering just such dependency abroad when giving away these vast sums.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aid spending has almost doubled since the last year of Labour government in 2009 under two PMs leading a party that claims fiscal probity.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bear in mind that even after eight long years of austerity, Britain still borrows £26bn a year. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This means we are getting further into debt to ensure we meet a discredited foreign aid target of giving away 0.7 per cent of national income each year — while Hammond has abandoned the Government’s long-cherished idea of paying off the deficit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I would not mind if thanks to our glorious munificence the poorest people on the planet were getting richer, corruption was being wiped out, wars were being thwarted and repressive regimes replaced by shiny new democracies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sadly, the opposite is true — even as aid does save lives with vaccinations and emergency relief. This torrent of cash undermines democracy, fuels conflict and assists gruesome despots. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the aid sector has grown so bloated, so desperate to protect its lucrative brands, it is riven with abuse and corruption as a consequence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A disturbing new report by the Independent Commission for Aid Impact, our aid watchdog, into £1.3bn spent over four years on efforts to improve maternal health in developing nations shows how the taint of corruption wafts through the corridors of Whitehall.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This report exposes all the usual dismal patterns of the aid industry: grandstanding at glitzy global conferences; spiralling sums spent with scant evidence based on unrealistic assumptions; failure to meet monitoring pledges; ignoring local people; undermining public services.</p><img id="i-47fcd0fc22c4c729" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/31/01/5597132-0-image-a-19_1540950751147.jpg" height="379" width="634" alt="Experts say the total given away by Britain in foreign aid will top £14bn.

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">But it also reveals something more sinister — that the Department for International Development (Dfid) inflated claims of success and deceived the British voters who fund this aid by boasting it had saved the lives of 103,000 women.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The vast bulk of deaths it claimed to have prevented were through contraception. So the department was claiming to have saved women from dying as a result of giving birth . . . even though the babies had never actually been conceived. It is beyond satire.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Malawi, Dfid claimed to have saved 2,000 lives through family planning. Yet teenage pregnancies rose, which in reality indicates a lack of contraception.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Officials also claimed to have saved 10,100 lives in four years when official figures showed maternal mortality rates stayed the same.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The litany of failed foreign aid projects seems endless. Earlier this month I was in Ghana visiting struggling villages being showered with British cash in a £230m project. It was designed to prove that aid works.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The reality was very different. Despite spending £2,906 per household in a region where farmers say they do well to earn £160 a year, a scathing review for the Government concluded ‘the project does not appear to have reduced poverty or hunger at all’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It also found factors explicitly targeted such as child mortality, vaccination rates, access to drinking water, ante-natal care and even mobile phone usage were not improved. Meanwhile, 31 per cent of funds went on management and overheads.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I visited a school with a sign boasting of being built with British aid. One room that had held seven computers was empty since the solar power system had broken. Another filled with broken desks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Development economists know it takes more than giant dollops of foreign cash to transform poor or troubled societies. Yet politicians ignore even their own evidence to carry on pumping cash into vainglorious projects around the globe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have learned through bitter experience to be wary of the ludicrous statistics spewed out by ministers and their acolytes in defence of daft aid policies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Two years ago Dfid bragged about aiding ‘freer and fairer elections in 13 countries’. I discovered these included two notoriously corrupt African autocracies, a ballot in Asia scarred by sectarian violence plus a Middle Eastern contest with only one candidate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Little wonder support for these spendthrift policies is falling — not least when we give £64m to a blood-soaked regime in Rwanda, which then hands a reported £30m to Arsenal, the dictator’s favourite premiership football team.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not to mention all those self-serving charities and profit-hungry private consultants growing fat on taxpayer largesse at a time when global poverty is falling fast due to capitalism, technology and medical advances. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many MPs know the great British aid giveaway is crazy and that the arguments for aid contain more holes than a colander. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They can also see how most rival nations simply ignore the flawed United Nations-set 0.7 per cent of GDP target.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even before Trump, the U.S. was giving away less than 0.2 per cent.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">John McDonnell has become a rare ham at the despatch box. Rare as Gloucester Old Spot. His purpose is to make us feel wretched and believe that the poor are being treated as badly as Dickensian urchins.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To this end, Shadow Chancellor McDonnell, who opened yesterday’s continuing debate on the Budget, used all manner of actorly tricks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His public image may be that of a dogmatic crypto-communist theorist but there is something shrewd about him as a parliamentarian. He has become a right thesp.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yesterday, speaking of children being taken into care, he dropped his volume and added a little check at the front of his throat, to suggest that he was moved to emotion.</p><img id="i-6c89d84954f5fab" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/31/00/5596230-6335763-image-a-3_1540946509627.jpg" height="414" width="634" alt="His public image may be that of a dogmatic crypto-communist theorist but there is something shrewd about him as a parliamentarian" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was an issue he returned to after an intervention from Angela Eagle (Lab, Wallasey). Mr McDonnell wrenched himself into a state of increasing dudgeon.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When a Conservative Member tried to intervene, this only gave his pulpiteer’s vexation another jolt of energy. ‘No!’ he cried, refusing to let the wicked Tory speak. ‘We have a record number of children coming into care.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As he said this he thrust his right arm up and down and cast his head to one side, barely able to look at the ministers opposite him. ‘I KNOW what it seems for a child coming into care,’ he thundered, real fury in his timbre. ‘You’re scarred for life!’</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">One did not need to be a Corbynite – I am not – to be struck by the oratorical moment. And when Mr McDonnell spat out, with a small grunt, that Philip Hammond had included lavatorial jokes in his Budget speech on Monday, there was an undeniable gulf between the moral fervour of this Labour man and the levity which had been adopted by the Chancellor doing his Leslie Crowther routine impression on Monday. That gulf did Mr Hammond few favours.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr McDonnell avoided mentioning the Budget’s tax cuts. Had Tory backbenchers been more clever they might have asked him about this, for it has split Labour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr McDonnell had said on the morning’s wireless that he would not block the tax cuts; other Labour MPs want to do that.</p><img id="i-1569884cf654130" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/31/00/5596228-6335763-image-a-4_1540946568602.jpg" height="355" width="634" alt="Mr McDonnell avoided mentioning the Budget’s tax cuts.

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps that was why the Labour benches were far from full. Higher parts of the Opposition side were unusually empty for such an event.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tory MPs kept interrupting Mr McDonnell, among them Chris Philp (Croydon S), whose staccato manner, and a brow riven with frowns, calls to mind Capt Darling in the Blackadder films.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So worried-looking, he could be a man in need of Pepto Bismol who has just been told that his Tube train is delayed in a tunnel for 15 minutes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The one good thing for the Conservatives yesterday was Health Secretary Matt Hancock, as sparky and optimistic as Mr McDonnell was glum. Mr Hancock is sharp enough to be able to glance at a table of official figures and cite them in detailed argument.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hancock’s friskiness aside, the afternoon was infected by Mr McDonnell’s pessimism. Nothing was good about the economy. Or life! George Freeman (Con, Mid Norfolk), an equable sort, asked: Was there nothing McDonnell could welcome in the Budget?</p><img id="i-6841565fb67a4c6b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/31/00/5596226-6335763-image-a-5_1540946624383.jpg" height="384" width="634" alt="Getting the Beeb to say ‘austerity’ instead of ‘deficit reduction’ has been a propaganda triumph for the Left. Now even the May Government uses it" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">What about the extra money for mental health? Mr McDonnell growled that the money was not enough.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It never is. This is the magical thing about that politicised term ‘austerity’ which Labour and the BBC have long used as a synonym for ‘reductions in public spending’. Getting the Beeb to say ‘austerity’ instead of ‘deficit reduction’ has been a propaganda triumph for the Left. Now even the May Government uses it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But ‘austerity’ can mean anything to a Labour MP. There is no statistical definition of ‘austerity’. ‘Austerity was always a bad idea,’ grunted Mr McDonnell, sullen-voiced, tight-lipped, glowering up at his eyebrows.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It had been caused not by past Labour Chancellors but by ‘the Tories’ casino economy of the 1980s’. Mention of Thatcherite days had an electric effect. Five Tories sprang to their feet to complain. Mr McDonnell gave a wintry smile. </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>QUENTIN LETTS: His public image may be that of a dogmatic crypto-communist theorist but there is something shrewd about him as a parliamentarian.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">By pushing up stamp duty on the most expensive homes, the Tory effort to calm the surge in house prices and raise money for the Exchequer has failed spectacularly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead of providing a new stream of income, as former Chancellor <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/george_osborne/index.html" id="mol-7fd0f550-dca7-11e8-bd85-4d741a89f7cb">George Osborne</a> hoped when he introduced the measure in 2014, it has led to a slump in transactions and deprived the Government of much needed resources.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And significantly it has created a huge blockage in the housing market, particularly in <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-7fd58930-dca7-11e8-bd85-4d741a89f7cb">London</a> and the South-East, preventing the strivers – highlighted by <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/philip-hammond/index.html" id="mol-7fd31830-dca7-11e8-bd85-4d741a89f7cb">Philip Hammond</a> in his feel-good budget – from climbing the housing ladder.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility, released with Monday’s Budget, show how raising the tax on house sales is a huge drag on the public finances and economy. In the current financial year, the stamp duty income is forecast to fall from £13.6bn in 2017 to £12.8bn as home sales have collapsed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, with stamp duty on the most expensive homes so prohibitively costly, the Treasury’s revenue on home deals is predicted to decline in each of the next five years. Another £1bn of receipts is set to go missing in 2019-20 alone.</p><img id="i-a183d6de330a9c4b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/31/00/5596262-0-image-a-1_1540946681072.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Former Chancellor George Osborne hoped when he introduced stamp duty hike in 2014 it would increase income streams but instead it led to a slump in transactions " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet in spite of the appalling impact of higher stamp duty on the sale of homes for more than £937,000 – which starts at an eye-watering ten per cent of the sale – it has become a tax which the Government is scared to lower or abolish.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Downing Street fears that meddling with the iniquitous charges imposed on higher price homes will open a new line of attack from Labour, which is seeking to paint the Conservatives as supporters only of the rich and privileged.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Osborne stamp duty change flies in the face of a basic economic truth embraced by Mrs Thatcher’s great reforming Chancellors, the late Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Both were avid believers in a well-proven economic theory which says that when marginal tax rates are too high, revenues will subside.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">To be fair to Osborne, he recognised this when he scythed Labour’s top rate of income tax from 50 per cent to 45 per cent – a policy which the current Labour leadership is perversely threatening to reverse.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A study by the Treasury found that far from cutting revenues, the reduction in the top rate of income tax actually encouraged tax-avoiders back into the system and proved to be an incentive for highly skilled individuals to stay in the UK rather than seek work in low-tax countries. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This effect has been seen even more dramatically as a result of the cut in corporation tax, which is the main levy paid by companies on their profits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Corporation tax stood at a hefty 28 per cent when the Coalition came to office and has since been cut to 19 per cent, with an intention to lower it to 17 per cent in future years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The cut in the tax rate has led to an enormous £18.5billion jump in revenues as a result of investment in Britain by overseas firms and the fact that British-based companies no longer engage to the same extent in tax-avoiding strategies.</p><img id="i-e393c623d5cc5b9a" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/31/00/5593874-0-image-a-2_1540946721136.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Strivers, who were highlighted by Philip Hammond in his feel-good budget, have been prevented from climbing the housing ladder, especially in London and the South East " class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">The higher stamp duties, which have seen the cost of buying a £1.5m home jump from £18,750 to £93,750 and to £153,750 on a £2million home, have proved pernicious.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Taxes at this level have brought the upper-end of the housing market to a shuddering halt. That might be seen as a good thing in a market where some regard prices as over-inflated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What it means, however, is families aspiring to a bigger home have found it cheaper to extend where they live.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a result, people in starter homes or apartments below this level cannot move up the scale and an iniquitous deadlock has been created because of a perverse interference in a free market. The result is a moribund housing market and a gaping great hole in tax revenues.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is also an impact on the nation’s output. House purchases are the biggest outlay for most of Middle Britain. When people buy new homes they also seek new kitchen equipment, soft furnishings, sofas, beds and much else – driving consumption, the service economy and manufacturing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The high rate of stamp duty on more expensive homes has been an unmitigated disaster. Philip Hammond should stand up to the Left-wing bullies – and abolish it before it does even more damage to the nation’s prosperity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>By pushing up stamp duty on the most expensive homes, the Tory effort to calm the surge in house prices and raise money for the Exchequer has failed spectacularly.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">I honestly believe (as would any rational person) that the editor of Waitrose Food Magazine was joking when he wrote he'd like to run a feature about 'killing vegans one by one'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">William Sitwell was responding to a dreary email from a freelance journalist who had suggested a series about 'plant-based meals'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Sitwell's brisk response was 'how about a column called The Honest Vegan, a millennial's diary of earnest endeavour and bacon sandwiches…' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Selene Nelson was mightily offended and so were the bosses at Waitrose, who said his words were 'extremely inappropriate and insensitive'.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a result, Mr Sitwell has had to resign and fellow food writers and chefs have expressed outrage that a joke (albeit in poor taste) has left him without a job. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He issued a grovelling statement claiming to 'love and respect people of all appetites, be they vegan, vegetarian or meat eaters'.</p><img id="i-12695c2e6e3aa619" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/30/23/5595176-0-image-m-22_1540942584470.jpg" height="490" width="634" alt="William Sitwell (pictured) was responding to a dreary email from a freelance journalist who had suggested a series about 'plant-based meals'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pass the sick bag! William Sitwell was guilty of attempting to be IRONIC - a quality that's lost on modern snowflakes who queue every day for the joy of eating a nut burger or tofu wrap on a recycled uncomfortable bench.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The devotees who shun almonds and fret about avocados are joyless people for whom every meal is a political statement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sadly for Mr Sitwell, these are difficult times for anyone who has a black sense of humour. I don't even know if that expression passes the politically correct test any more - perhaps I should say 'darker' humour. If irony is your bag, nowadays you could be guilty of hate speech - make fun of gender fluidity, vegans (and cyclists) at your peril.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most have had a humour bypass.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">William Sitwell had already stated his growing irritation with the onslaught of propaganda emanating from non-meat eaters - in January he wrote in a newspaper 'vegans are parking their tanks on all of our lawns. And their instruction manuals are coming like propaganda pamphlets dropping from the sky'. In other words, it's war out there in foodie world, and meat eaters had better be scared.</p><div>
</div><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">I am sure that Mr Sitwell did not want to end of life of a vegan, but in politically-correct 2018, one person's savage retort is another's insult, the source of deep hurt and potential legal action.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once, we regarded people who swore and trashed others publicly as excitingly outspoken - in the 1970's comedians like Richard Pryor sprinkled his act with the n-word, Dennis Lehry- launched his career 25 years ago with No Cure For Cancer - ('it's great having throat cancer because a tracheotomy means you can puff two cigarettes at once') and Larry Amaros joked he knew gay burglars had been round because they re-arranged the cushions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Much of that stuff wouldn't be acceptable today. Especially on university campuses, with their 'safe spaces'. Gays would feel stereotyped. The gender fluid people would feel left out. Cancer victims would be offended and the opioid crisis in the USA means drugs are no longer comedy material.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our use of language and our ability to trade insults is becoming pitifully safe as we strive not to upset each other.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It takes a big old beast from another generation to cause maximum offence these days - and his name is Donald Trump.</p><img id="i-a92eb0adf972aaaf" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/30/23/5595236-0-image-a-31_1540942830969.jpg" height="365" width="306" alt="I am sure that Mr Sitwell did not want to end of life of a vegan, but in politically-correct 2018, one person's savage retort is another's insult, the source of deep hurt and potential legal action, writes Janet Street-Porter" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Commentators in the liberal press and even the Financial Times accuse the President of using over-the- top language in his tweets to stir up his followers and goad them into aggressive acts. But is there really a link between calling the President of North Korea 'rocket man' and the threat of nuclear war? A couple of months later they announced they were in love with each other. It's all posturing and puppetry.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Trump rants in block capitals about migrants being DEALT WITH, he's inadvertently revealing his inability to do anything to stop the thousands of people arriving on the Mexican border from Guatemala, people who are legally entitled to claim asylum in the USA.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The more abusive and shouty Trump is, the less powerful he seems. The President is old school, a man who would talk about women as if they were plastic shop display models rather than living breathing humans. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps because attractive women threaten him, maybe because (if we believe Stormy Daniels) a sexual encounter-rather than a brief social interaction in public view - might reveal him to be a less than inpressive specimen. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Who feels powerful in their pants? No wonder he's calling her 'horseface'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Only the other week Trump belittled a female reporter from ABC News, saying 'she never thinks' before asking a question.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He called Senator Elizabeth Warren 'Pocahontas' because she claimed Native American Indian ancestry - a claim which turned out to be (just about) true.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He routinely calls women of a certain age ugly. But most savvy females don't find Trump upsetting - he's typical of white men of his generation in positions of power.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clothing multimillionaire Sir Phillip Green is another posturing ranter of a certain age - accused by several members of staff of racist and sexist remarks and bullying tactics, Green has spent over £500,000 trying to keep details of his behaviour out of the press and god knows how much on legally binding gagging settlements for his victims</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He is alleged to have told one woman he'd like to chuck her out of the window, but she was so fat 'she'd probably bounce back'. He says he's being 'used as a target' and was just indulging in 'banter.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In my opinion, Sir Phillip is more dislikeable for his appalling treatment of the pensioners who worked at BHS and who faced poverty in their retirement because of his mismanagement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I can't get that worked up about insults in the workplace - because men of that generation (and women too) frequently lost their temper when things weren't going according to plan.

William Sitwell was responding to a dreary email from a freelance journalist who had suggested a series about ‘plant-based meals’. Mr Sitwell’s brisk response was “how about a column called The Honest Vegan, a millennial’s diary of earnest endeavour and bacon sandwiches…” Selene Nelson was mightily offended and so were the bosses at Waitrose, who said his words were ‘extremely inappropriate and insensitive’. As a result, Sitwell is eating a massive slice of Waitrose’s best artisanal humble pie, apologising profusely, issuing a grovelling statement claiming to ‘love and respect people of all appetites, be they vegan, vegetarian or meat eaters’.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Janet Street-Porter For Mailonline</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-11-01T12:04:26.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>If you can’t take a joke you shouldn’t have joined the human race</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-11-01T12:04:26.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>MSN Push</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/30/23/5595234-0-image-a-34_1540943278395.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6335477/Meghan-Markle-Prince-Harry-arrive-Rotorua-final-day-marathon-royal-tour.html" title="Meghan Markle wears a traditional Maori cloak made from pheasant feathers to protect her during pregnancy as she and Prince Harry begin the final day of their marathon royal tour"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6335277/Secret-plan-make-Charles-Prince-Regent-three-years.html" title="Arise the Shadow King!

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Back in 1947, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Hugh Dalton was forced to resign after leaking details of his <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/news/budget/index.html">Budget </a>to a journalist called John Carvel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some of his tax changes, including a penny on a pint of beer, appeared in later editions of the long-since defunct <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-8f3298b0-dbed-11e8-8315-9995aed1801c">London</a> evening newspaper, The Star, while Dalton was still on his hind legs in the Commons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His fellow MPs were outraged at this shocking breach of Parliamentary protocol, even though there was no evidence that early disclosure had any effect on the price of fish, let alone the stock market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nevertheless, Dalton was obliged to fall on his sword. Three decades later, I found myself working on London’s Evening Standard, alongside — some rungs below, actually — Carvel’s son Robert, the Standard’s political editor.</p><img id="i-e4253b4d193a0f27" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/30/01/099EC18B000005DC-6331605-Back_in_1947_the_then_Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer_Hugh_Dalton_pi-m-9_1540863755132.jpg" height="555" width="634" alt="Back in 1947, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Hugh Dalton (pictured left) was forced to resign after leaking details of his Budget to a journalist called John Carvel" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-b3710227fde30276" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/30/01/5554590-6331605-Spread_Fear_Phil_was_preening_himself_all_over_the_TV_channels_a-m-24_1540864015936.jpg" height="483" width="634" alt="Spread Fear Phil was preening himself all over the TV channels at the weekend, teasing anyone who could be bothered to listen about his plans for the coming year" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the big set-piece events of Bob Carvel’s year, for which he would fortify himself with a can or two of Carlsberg Special Brew, was Budget Day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By then, although Chancellors were supposed to spend the preceding weeks in so-called ‘purdah’, selected political editors were spoon-fed a few crucial morsels on the understanding that they weren’t published in advance of the Budget speech.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This gave Fleet Street’s cartoonists plenty of time to prepare their front page illustrations, which were dependent on the theme of the measures being announced.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">For instance, if the Chancellor of the day decided to bung the NHS an extra few quid, he’d be depicted as a benevolent doctor in a white coat, complete with stethoscope.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If he froze the duty on Scotch whisky, he’d inevitably be caricatured sipping a wee dram, wearing a tartan kilt and a See You Jimmy bonnet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Novelty front pages were as much a part of the annual Budget Day ritual as the Chancellor posing on the steps of No 11 Downing Street, waving his red box, which is supposed to contain the closely guarded secrets he is about to reveal to the Commons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These days you’ll find more secrets inside a box of Black Magic. The modern Treasury leaks like a colander, every year mounting a series of clumsy, stage-managed attempts to soften us up for the good news/bad news in store.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even the Chancellor himself can’t resist getting in on the act. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Spread Fear Phil was preening himself all over the TV channels at the weekend, teasing anyone who could be bothered to listen about his plans for the coming year. Not for Hammond the strictly-enforced purdah, breach of which cost Hugh Dalton the keys to No 11.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The papers have been full of deliberately placed titbits involving everything from help for the High Street to more money for tree planting. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today’s Budgets are as much about burnishing the Chancellor’s own political credentials as addressing the nation’s finances.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why else would Hammond be announcing that all schools and A&amp;E departments are to get dedicated mental health units, apart from the fact that there’s been a well-orchestrated campaign to elevate mental health to the top of the political agenda — so that it is now acknowledged as an ‘epidemic’ which can only be cured by throwing lashings of taxpayers’ money at it?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not that he’s the faintest idea how he is going to pay for this largesse. </p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The grand gesture is all that counts. He’s even had the audacity to use his round of pre-Budget briefings to threaten that unless we swallow Mother Theresa’s dismal, defeatist, dishwater-weak Chequers version of Brexit, then all bets are off and we can forget about whatever goodies he announced yesterday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don’t be fooled by gimmicks like the commemorative Brexit 50p coin. Hammond and May are determined to keep us under the yoke of the EU at all costs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No deal, no end to austerity, is the ultimatum from the Chancellor. What does that even mean? We’re supposed to send £39 billion to Brussels when the nation is £1.8 trillion in debt and rising?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I want to scream every time I hear politicians and lobbyists bleating about ‘austerity’. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why don’t we talk instead about ‘balancing the books’, or ‘living within our means’, or ‘not spending money we haven’t got’, or ‘not borrowing money we can’t afford to pay back’? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why even bother with a Budget? Most of the fiddling with tax thresholds can be put on the statute book without a great song and dance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The only ‘secrets’ in Hammond’s red box are the nasty surprises which he will have somehow forgotten to tell the Commons and will only emerge a couple of days later when the dust settles.</p><div class="item">

And, as I have explained previously, Hammond is little more than a third-rate Gordon Brown tribute act.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So I shall continue my habit of reserving judgment on the Budget until it unravels later this week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once, a penny on a pint made headlines. Now, who knows how much a pint costs? In parts of London, you’ll get no change from a fiver. Elsewhere a pint will only (only?) cost £3.40. So whatever the Chancellor does to alcohol duty, it won’t make much difference.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for Hammond himself, he is a political mediocrity who has shamelessly abused his high office to consistently undermine and attempt to overturn the democratic will of 17.4 million people who voted for Britain to leave the EU — no ifs, no buts, no transition period, no backstops, no common rule book, no divorce payment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If he had a shred of his predecessor Hugh Dalton’s decency, the only statement he should have delivered yesterday was his resignation.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Guy Fawkes Night looms and with it the problem of what to do about pets frightened by the loud bangs from fireworks. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Classic FM believes it has the answer and has prepared a playlist of soothing music designed to keep anxious dogs calm. Apparently, animals are especially responsive to Mozart and Bach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This comes in the wake of a report, from Glasgow University, which claims playing reggae by the likes of Bob Marley and UB40 to dogs will have the same effect.</p><img id="i-4e49d436d701f9ac" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/30/01/5557908-6331605-image-a-7_1540863664465.jpg" height="225" width="634" alt="This comes in the wake of a report, from Glasgow University, which claims playing reggae by the likes of Bob Marley and UB40 to dogs will have the same effect" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">That sounds more likely to me.

If all else fails, a juicy bone should do the trick.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It always worked with Ossie.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong> We need to have Ram Jam banned</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hate preacher Ram Jam Choudary is free to walk the streets again after serving just half of his five year sentence for inciting terrorism.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Naturally, Choudary remains unrepentant in the face of such laughable leniency. Meanwhile, hundreds of jihadi brides and others he encouraged to join Izal are flooding back to Britain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what is to prevent Ram Jam picking up where he left off? OK, so he’s being monitored round the clock for the next couple of years, but that kind of surveillance won’t last for ever.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is, of course, the Islamist rabble rouser linked to the London Bridge terrorists and the men who killed Fusilier Lee Rigby.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How, then, do the authorities propose to stop his murderous mentoring of impressionable young men and women in future? Answer: they’re going to send him on an anti-extremism course.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brilliant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That should work.

It paid a rates bill of £80million on its 166 shops last year, compared with an estimated £14million paid by the highly profitable Amazon on its 14 warehouses in England and Wales. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It isn’t just big businesses that are suffering – it is small shops that are really bearing the brunt. People at the sharp end, like Mark Rayner, manager of the Ashworth and Bird menswear shop in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. He recently told the Mail how difficult it was to compete with online giants such as fashion retailer Asos, which has its vast warehouse just a few miles away from Barnsley’s ailing high street, where stores hand over a large portion of their takings in rates.</p><img id="i-f89109ce24b16143" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/24/22/5380140-6313511-image-a-1_1540415259057.jpg" height="444" width="634" alt="Debenhams posted a loss of almost £500million for the year and is planning to close up to 50 stores as a result" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-91aef3925149904" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/30/02/5558726-6331717-image-a-13_1540866634215.jpg" height="397" width="634" alt="Chancellor Philip Hammond makes his Budget statement to MPs in the House of Commons yesterday" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Bills will be cut by a third on properties with a rateable value of less than £51,000, which covers nine out of ten premises, for two years starting next year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hammond has thrown small retailers another lifeline by keeping the VAT threshold at £85,000. There had been widespread speculation he would lower the level at which firms were drawn into the net, heaping red tape and admin on thousands more small shops. Thankfully, he chose to give them a break, to sighs of relief all round.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Chancellor has also invested £675million in a ‘Future High Street Fund’ to spruce up local town centres plus around £900million on business rates relief.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The cash tills are also more likely to be ringing because shoppers will have more cash in their pockets to spend, as the Chancellor is raising the amounts people can earn before they pay higher rate tax, and before they come into the tax net at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, most importantly, Philip Hammond deserves the thanks not only of retailers but of every taxpayer in Britain for having the guts to take on the powerful Silicon Valley giants who have prospered so richly in this country. Never have companies made so much from so many, while paying so little in tax.</p><mol-permabox id="mol-5de0a100-dbeb-11e8-8d28-fd31431ad427"></mol-permabox><p class="mol-para-with-font">Critics doubted Hammond would dare to take the first step in putting a stop to the ridiculous situation where gigantic American online businesses make billions of sales and harvest huge advertising revenues here, but make next to no contribution to our society. He has proved those doubters wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Under the existing system, the tech behemoths have been paying puny sums in UK corporation tax. Amazon’s bill was just £4.67million last year and Facebook’s a derisory £15million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These sums are, when set against the multi-billion revenues they have racked up, quite patently pathetic. So Hammond’s move to raise more than £400million a year through a two per cent tax on revenues, starting from April 2020, is a first step to righting an obvious wrong. True, the sums are small in the context of the needs of the NHS, for example, but they are a lot more than the Exchequer is receiving from the tech companies now – and more importantly, they are a major move in the right direction.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hammond has listened to the retailers and taken action – unlike finance ministers in other countries similarly affected.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The tech tax is not – as the digital giants and their cheerleaders forlornly try to argue – an anti-business measure: it is a matter of simple fairness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Amazon, Facebook et al have changed our lives and brought many benefits including creating jobs in Britain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But in making their profits here, they have availed themselves of our public assets: our road and rail infrastructure, our legal system, our education and health provision that look after their staff.Bricks and mortar businesses contribute to these benefits, and so should the digital operators. Now they will have to.  </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Even middle-class stalwarts such as John Lewis have seen their profits dwindle away to virtually nothing.

Through this display of quiet courage in the face of pressure from his own Treasury officials, he’s protected the self-employed and small businessmen and women — the backbone of this country — from a pointless and costly bureaucratic burden.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In addition, Hammond earns his place in history as the first finance minister of an advanced Western country to turn his firepower on the high-tech giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon who fail to pay their fair share of taxes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the insufferable Mark Zuckerberg, of Facebook, next runs into bumptious Jeff Bezos, of Amazon, I suspect they will be exchanging words about Spreadsheet Phil — and they won’t be friendly ones.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Succeeded</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Zuckerberg, I feel confident, will be ordering his new spin doctor, little Nick Clegg (how humiliating to reflect he was once our Deputy Prime Minister) to do his worst.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some commentators yesterday accused the Chancellor of cowardice for not going far enough. I disagree.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While the new taxes raise £400 million, a sum that it has to be said is puny in comparison with the billions these behemoths make in profits, no other country has had the courage to take them on at all. Hammond has set a trend which I predict will be followed by many others.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Normally the most cautious of solid citizens, he’s leading the way. Yes, Philip Hammond has put the wind up the money-grubbing plutocrats of Silicon Valley, and we should all thank him for it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Chancellor has also succeeded brilliantly in solving his Government’s greatest short-term problem. Yesterday’s Budget, more than anything else, was about attempting to prevent a Government defeat on the Brexit vote — if Mrs May succeeds in getting a deal — in December. He gave Tory MPs the good economic news they wanted to hear but there was an implied threat: toe the line or you may have to endure another Budget in April. A Budget that could be delivered by a new chancellor, Labour’s John McDonnell.</p><div class="item">

There was no vision. No grandeur. Instead we had an accumulation of relatively small and finickety announcements, such as the £400 million allocated to repair potholes. Important and doubtless badly needed. But adding up to what exactly?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The blunt truth is that Hammond lacks the intellectual confidence and shameless verve of Margaret Thatcher’s great chancellor Nigel Lawson in the Eighties.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Equally, he lacks the heavyweight physical and moral presence of Tony Blair’s chancellor Gordon Brown, with his vows of fiscal prudence and schemes of virtuous investment. He even lacks an idea as big and meaningful as his predecessor George Osborne’s programme of cuts to corporation tax designed to make Britain the most competitive economy in Europe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, I would go as far as to say that Philip Hammond would have done well to award a nod of thanks to Mr Osborne, whose hard work in bringing down the deficit during his time in office has given the present Chancellor the leeway to go on his spending spree.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But for Osborne, Hammond would never have been able to bring forward the rise in tax thresholds for the punitive 40 per cent rate to next year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was this unexpected move more than any other that injected a note of cheerfulness into what is a Budget expertly tailored for Middle Britain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Philip Hammond should also be grateful for his luck. He long ago earned the sobriquet Spreadsheet Phil. From now on perhaps he should be known as Windfall Phil or even Phil-Your-Boots Hammond because he has been able to lift the spirits of the nation thanks to two spectacular pieces of good fortune.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Magic</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first concerns much higher than expected tax revenues which enable him to spend more than he predicted as recently as last Spring.</p><div class="item">

Reduce taxes or raise spending?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He decided to do both. To have his cake and eat it. So where did Phil find his magic money tree? The answer is simple. By adding to government borrowing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He could have brought down the deficit so government finances were in balance. That would have been the responsible course of action expected of a Tory chancellor.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In his defence, this decision was made for him by the Prime Minister, with her 70th birthday gift of an extra £20 billion for the NHS in June, followed by her announcement at Conservative Conference that the age of austerity was over.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Advantage</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The political advantage of this course of action is obvious. Mrs May is fighting the battle of her political life and like many Prime Ministers before her has elected to buy her way out of trouble.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I guess Hammond has gone along with this reckless though understandable course of action with deepest reluctance. In the end though, I wish he had stuck to his fiscally conservative instincts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At this stage of the economic cycle any Tory government worth its salt would be boasting sound finances. I hope I am wrong, but if the Tories have embarked on a spending arms race with Labour there will be only one winner.

Only hours after regional election results in Hesse, central <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/germany/index.html" id="mol-ccf1c0c0-dbd6-11e8-b959-c1605fad2a11">Germany</a>, showed her party haemorrhaging a tenth of its support, the Iron Chancellor announced that she will not stand for re-election as chairman of the Christian <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/democrats/index.html" id="mol-ccf0fd70-dbd6-11e8-b959-c1605fad2a11">Democratic Party</a> this autumn, and will step down as Chancellor in 2021.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She still intends to stay on for at least two more years, mind you. But given that she has now acknowledged her own political mortality and set a time limit on her departure, yesterday's announcement represents a sensational admission of weakness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The truth is that this has been coming for years. Mrs Merkel has led her country since 2005 and her party since 2000. For a generation, she has been by far Europe's leading political figure.</p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<img id="i-fe589cf85c92eb26" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/29/23/5556160-0-image-a-108_1540857430218.jpg" height="392" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the last three years, however, her political authority has been steadily ebbing. And although electoral fatigue and the rise of smaller parties have played their part, the plain fact is that her troubles really started the moment in 2015 that she threw open Germany's borders to an estimated one million Middle Eastern migrants.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the time, Mrs Merkel insisted that given its unhappy history, Germany had a special responsibility to look after those in trouble. And when people had the temerity to wonder whether the influx of so many newcomers might cause social problems of its own, she said simply: 'Wir schaffen das' – 'We can do this.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs Merkel's decision may have reflected well on her sense of social duty, but in hindsight it looks a moment of dreadful hubris and political irresponsibility. The most obvious political result has been the shocking surge of the far-Right AfD, which won 13 per cent of the vote in last year's federal elections and picked up another 12 per cent in Hesse at the weekend.</p><img id="i-3459520930b5635e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/30/00/5556166-6331337-image-a-1_1540858047277.jpg" height="434" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The AfD are clearly not going away. And the problem now for Mrs Merkel is that whenever her she and her centre-Right allies try to lure back the AfD's voters, they end up driving away moderates to parties like the Greens, who won almost 20 per cent in Hesse.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In effect, she is being squeezed from both Right and Left. To make matters worse, her coalition partners, the centre-Left Social Democrats, did even worse and may pull out of her governing coalition.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs Merkel may talk of continuing until 2021, but whether her party will allow her to last that long is another matter. The fact is that her regime has the smell of death about it. And the irony is she will leave behind a body politic poisoned by rows about immigration, with the far-Right buoyant for the first time since the 1930s.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Historians will surely look back on her final years in office as a case study in utopian over-reach. The truth is that however fine your motives, however righteous your rhetoric, you can only push your people so far.</p><img id="i-e1620c1e4ffc8102" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/30/01/5557608-6331337-image-m-4_1540862103087.jpg" height="366" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-bca90949d7ae0592" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/30/01/5555756-6331337-Historians_will_surely_look_back_on_her_final_years_in_office_as-a-5_1540862111874.jpg" height="366" width="306" alt="Historians will surely look back on her final years in office as a case study in utopian over-reach" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is telling, I think, that her latest humiliation came on the very day that Jair Bolsonaro was sweeping to victory in distant Brazil. With his blood-curdling rhetoric about criminals and immigrants, as well his attacks on feminists and homosexuals, Brazil's new president represents everything that Mrs Merkel abhors.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But he is also the latest face of a political trend that is sweeping the industrialised world, from Victor Orban in Hungary to Matteo Salvini in Italy. All these figures are tapping voters' anxieties about crime, economic insecurity, multiculturalism and mass migration – anxieties fuelled, in part, by the policies pursued by Mrs Merkel and her admirers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Revealingly, the AfD were quick to send their congratulations, praising Mr Bolsonaro as part of a worldwide 'conservative revolution', and as someone who 'like the AfD ... has been attacked from all sides because he, as an outsider, has challenged the system'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Germany's tragedy is that now, more than at any time since the fall of Nazism, the chances of a Teutonic version of the Brazilian strongman are greater than ever. And that, I fear, will be Mrs Merkel's most enduring legacy.</p><div class="item">

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hmmn. There was possibly only one person 'desperate' here.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was a vain and aggressively political Budget. The opening 30 lines of a Budget always contain political hyperbole but yesterday it felt unusually heavy-handed. He claimed that Conservative spending cuts were 'not driven by ideology' (cue yelps of disagreement from the Labour side). 'The strivers, the grafters and the carers – this Budget is unashamedly for you,' said Mr Hammond. That 'unashamedly' left a tang.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As he stood at the despatch box, vulpine, licking his lips with self-pleasure, he plainly thought himself the dog's dandies. It was not an opinion universally shared. The Conservative benches listened with something more than neutrality but less than rapture. They were possibly just grateful to have a break from Brexit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To hear Hammond, one of the most cynical founts of Project Fear, claim he was 'embracing change' was enough to raise a mordant laugh. He also claimed to be speaking for 'hard-working families who care little for the twists and turns of Westminster politics'. Ha! Few are sneakier at those games than P. Hammond.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before he began there was a minor moment of farce when Liz Truss, Treasury Chief Secretary, was denied a front-bench seat by two men – David Lidington and Mel Stride – and huffily stomped off towards the gangway, only to be beckoned back by Theresa May. Sajid Javid had made room for her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Chivalry is not dead,' chuckled Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle. As ever, the Budget was chaired by him and not by the Speaker. The moment Speaker Bercow departed and Mr Hoyle took his place, MPs cheered. Mr Hoyle oversaw proceedings generally with tact and humour, although he shouted when Labour and Scots Nats MPs stood and (against convention) clapped a protest by female pensioners in the Strangers' Gallery. Gallery protests are a bit pointless these days because the bullet-proof glass now makes them inaudible. We could see these women bawling but not a word of it could be heard. It was like a pre-talkies movie.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Behind Mr Hammond sat his aide Kwase Kwarteng, itching at Labour jibes. Not all Opposition MPs were agitated. Sir Keir Starmer, Shadow Brexit Secretary, rested his eyes like Butch the bulldog in Tom and Jerry. The best moments were when Mr Hammond detailed drops in public debt. The worse was a protracted announcement about public lavatories, full of puns about 'relief'. Mrs May groaned.</p><img id="i-538803a27502d195" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/29/22/5553678-6331119-image-a-13_1540851051917.jpg" height="379" width="634" alt="The Chancellor pledged an 'end to austerity' as he revealed sweeping increases in funding for the NHS and armed forces" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">If Mr Hammond's speech lacked a wallop moment – a moment to electrify his troops – it was because so much of the detail had been flogged to the media beforehand. Also: how wise is it to use that highly politicised word 'austerity'? All it means is 'lower spending'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He admitted, archly, that although it was usual to have 'a rabbit or two in the hat, this year some of my star bunnies seem to have escaped!' Ho ho. And yet, he claimed that he could still 'poach a rabbit', and announced some low-key stuff about health spending. A Labour heckler felt that far from being a rabbit, this was 'a dead dog'. That won a bigger laugh than some of Mr Hammond's tortuous drolleries.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When he said he would review some policy at his next Budget, a Labour MP (I think Paula Sherriff from Dewbsury) shouted: 'You won't be here!' Big laugh. Mr Hammond countered with an extempore remark along the lines that people had written him off before but he was still standing. Malvolio shaking his fist and swearing vengeance. Just you see!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was a flash of defiance in that moment, not quite sour but certainly tinged with bloody-mindedness. A limited man remains convinced he is a titan.</p><div>

It is just a bit more honest in admitting it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cesar Sayoc, the man who last week allegedly posted a dozen pipe bombs to the addresses of prominent critics of President Donald Trump, had himself used Twitter to communicate violent threats. Yet the social media platform had cursorily brushed aside complaints about his account.</p><img id="i-b5724586ab53aec8" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/29/01/5500094-6327477-At_one_point_officers_told_dispatchers_that_they_needed_to_evacu-a-13_1540777711584.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Armed officers secure the scene  at the Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood on Saturday." class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">A fortnight before the pipe bombs were mailed, Rochelle Ritchie, a former press secretary for the Democrats who appears frequently on television, had complained to Twitter that the account now known to be that of Sayoc had been sending deeply menacing messages to her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Complaint</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They included images of human body parts, and one of his tweets to her read: ‘We will see you 4 sure, Hug your loved ones real close every time you leave home.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But when Ritchie reported this to Twitter, the company that same day rebuffed her, insisting that his tweets did not breach their guidelines.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Naturally, now that Sayoc has been arrested, Twitter has taken down his account and has told Ritchie that its previous assessment of her complaint was ‘made in error’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It wasn’t an error: it was policy.</p><img id="i-e2e4c4705c351756" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/26/20/5453796-6321803-image-m-28_1540580653623.jpg" height="306" width="306" alt="Twitter has apologized to political analyst Rochelle Ritchie (above) for dismissing her complaint after MAGAbomber suspect Cesar Altier Sayoc tweeted death threats at her" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-823e3bd80e5d0713" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/26/20/5455242-6321803-MAGAbomber_suspect_Cesar_Altier_Sayoc-a-5_1540582294794.jpg" height="306" width="306" alt="MAGAbomber suspect Cesar Altier Sayoc" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-f4dc5dbb2f7cd4e3" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/29/01/5474014-6323565-The_social_media_giant_tweeted_an_apology_for_its_failure_to_tak-a-1_1540777475168.jpg" height="745" width="634" alt="The social media giant tweeted an apology for its failure to take Ritchie's report seriously under its @TwitterSafety handle on Friday. The apology came after it was revealed that Sayoc had tweeted numerous similar threats to several celebrities and Democratic party leaders" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The big social media companies are not merely disinterested providers of a platform to allow humanity to meet online, as they like to portray it, but hard-headed businesses whose revenues derive from accumulating the largest number of users and targeting advertising at them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So they have a profound reluctance to close accounts — partly because they fear that those shut down will move to a rival social media company instead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, it seems that Gab had promoted itself as being even less fastidious than Twitter (which is saying something).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This might be described as the media version of Gresham’s Law, which states that ‘bad money drives out good’. The social media behemoths, notably Facebook, are taking the overwhelming proportion of advertising revenues at the expense, mostly, of the newspaper industry. It is the principal reason for the extinction of so many local newspapers, both in the U.S. and this country.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As someone who has spent the past 40 years in the newspaper business, I can be accused of commercial sour grapes. But even those without a vested interest can surely see there is a trick being pulled by social media companies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They claim that they are not publishers at all, but just ‘tech’ businesses. Governments have accepted this, and that means these firms are exempt from all the responsibilities and liabilities that the law imposes on traditional publishers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the Daily Mail publishes defamatory articles, it is liable to be sued for libel. And, under the Press regulator IPSO, it can be fined up to £1million and made to publish retractions in full — even on the front page if that is deemed necessary by the regulator.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">None of this applies to those whose platforms are used by the likes of Robert Bowers and Cesar Sayoc.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Facebook, for example, likes to argue that it is akin to the Post Office, which is not liable in law for any poison pen or blackmail letter that’s sent via its service.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there are two essential differences. The Post Office does not attach advertisements to any poison pen letters that it sends across the country, so does not seek to monetise threats of violence. Secondly, short of steaming all its customers’ letters open, it has no way of knowing what is being communicated in the mail it enables.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Humiliate</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the social media companies can and do know. Or at least their algorithms do.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After all, if those programs didn’t have a way of determining the nature of what is being transmitted, the social media business model of individually targeted advertisements wouldn’t work.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, Facebook’s policy director Simon Milner gave the game away when he told a House of Commons Select Committee investigating the social media: ‘We use photo DNA, a piece of technology created by Microsoft, and we use that to scan every photo uploaded to Facebook.’</p><img id="i-eedde12f313107eb" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/29/02/5518520-6327477-image-a-15_1540778404133.jpg" height="344" width="634" alt="Executives from Twitter, Facebook and Google (pictured) were hauled before the Home Affairs Select Committee in December to explain how they were tackling online dangers. Pictured from left are Google vice president Dr Nicklas Berild Lundblad, Twitter's vice president for public policy and communications in Europe, the Middle East and Africa Sinead McSweeney, and Facebook's director for public policy Simon Milner" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-af72e0f445207d30" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/29/01/5518516-6327477-image-a-14_1540778400064.jpg" height="415" width="634" alt="Facebook's public policy director Simon Milner told MPs the social media 'platform' was helping authorities to understand radicalisation online" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">This admission was seized on by Edward Fitzgerald QC, when he was acting two years ago for an unnamed Northern Irish child whose nude image was repeatedly being posted on Facebook by someone who had groomed her and was now trying to humiliate her. Facebook repeatedly claimed that it could take the image down only if a complaint was made, but could not do so of its own accord.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet if it has the ‘thumbprint’ of every image posted on its site, then its system clearly ‘knows’ when that nude image of the 14-year-old child was reposted. It wasn’t that Facebook couldn’t block the image permanently — and save the girl and her parents huge distress — but that it couldn’t be bothered.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Or perhaps it was terrified of being seen to exercise such an ‘editorial’ decision, as this would identify it as a publisher, with all the legal consequences that implies in terms of liability.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its argument against this, if pushed, is to say that it would be punitively time-consuming to check all the billions of images and messages that it doesn’t ‘really’ publish. But if it is too big (that is, too successful) to moderate satisfactorily what goes out under its logo, then it is too big, full stop.</p><img id="i-b3437aacd536bb0b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/30/22/4EB2F65300000578-6008369-image-a-5_1532984935294.jpg" height="545" width="306" alt="Salman Abedi (pictured) used a a ‘bomb-making tutorial’ before he committed mass-murderer at Manchester Arena" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">And Facebook does seem to fail the most basic tests. A few months ago, the Mail revealed how Islamic State propaganda videos had been left on its site for up to three years, until this newspaper raised a stink. These videos included a ‘bomb-making tutorial’ used by the Manchester Arena mass-murderer Salman Abedi.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The former Foreign Office counter-terrorism director Sir Ivor Roberts said that the failure to take down the videos was ‘chilling and inexcusable’, and that ‘Facebook’s recent series of apologies and assurances they will take action is clearly fake news’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Murderous</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Fake news’, of course, is the term popularised by Donald Trump to describe the traditional media — specifically the newspapers who hold him to account in the way that my trade has always done to those in positions of power.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And so, bizarrely, after the mail bombs posted by one of his supporters to various of his political opponents were discovered, the President blamed the Press for whipping up the hatred that resulted in such murderous intent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Donald Trump tweeted: ‘It has gotten so bad and hateful it is beyond description. Mainstream media must clean up its act FAST!’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As the former CIA director, John Brennan, who was the recipient of one of the mailed pipe bombs, responded: ‘Look in the mirror. Your inflammatory rhetoric, insults, lies and encouragement of physical violence are disgraceful.’</p><img id="i-bbf6c0a08eae4baa" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/25/19/5413520-6315709-image-a-20_1540491099300.jpg" height="416" width="634" alt="Locations to which MAGAbomber sent the deadly devices included the home of former US President Bill Clinton and his wife and former Democrat Presidential candidate Hillary" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-94457655192734a6" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/26/18/5405126-6319391-Investigators_swarmed_two_Delaware_mail_facilities_on_Thursday_m-a-9_1540575486946.jpg" height="582" width="634" alt="Investigators swarmed two Delaware mail facilities after intercepting packages addressed to former Vice President Joe Biden" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">At least Trump — a man with the biggest ego known to medical science — does not hide behind the protection of anonymity or a fake name.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The transformation of the Chancellor from ‘Spreadsheet Phil’ to ‘Spendthrift Phil’ has been remarkable to behold. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the weeks and days running up to today’s budget there have been all manner of tantalising pledges hinted at or revealed, more or less something for everyone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today, as the Mail reports, there is a promised extra £2billion boost for mental health services. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yesterday’s papers announced a £30billion national roads fund, £800million extra to local government for social care, more millions to be invested in installing superfast broadband in remote areas, and possibly as much as £1billion for defence.</p><img id="i-a76affa28ee624e7" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/29/00/5507298-0-image-a-18_1540773497506.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Just one question: Where will the money come from? Mr Hammond is better able to meet his spending pledges because of a tax windfall" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">All of this on top of the £1.5billion lifeline for the high street, including slashing business rates (temporarily) for small retailers, and an extra £20billion to already committed increases in the NHS budget announced in June.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just one question: Where will the money come from? Mr Hammond is better able to meet his spending pledges because of a tax windfall. </p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The public finances in the current financial year 2018-19 are in much better shape than forecast by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility in the spring.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Strong tax receipts, the result of near full employment and consumer confidence, mean that the Chancellor has an extra £13billion of cash to play with.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remarkably, a decade of squeezing public spending and better-than-expected growth has seen the budget deficit plunge from £150billion to just £25billion. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The national debt, the accumulation of borrowing down the decades, has also begun falling.</p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">The Chancellor is, additionally, starting to factor in a double Brexit dividend should Mrs May secure a deal with Brussels that could release up to £15billion of extra tax income as the economy takes off once we are free of EU red tape and restrictions. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is hoped, too, that companies holding off on investment decisions will, post-deal, bring them forward, contributing to faster output.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And any deal could also release the £10billion or so that the Chancellor has been keeping in his back pocket to cushion a ‘no deal’ exit from the EU (although the Treasury is clear that this money will not be available until the spending review next spring).</p><img id="i-7bc29166119397a8" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/29/00/5507294-6327053-image-a-18_1540772927305.jpg" height="378" width="634" alt="Strong tax receipts, the result of near full employment and consumer confidence, mean that the Chancellor has an extra £13billion of cash to play with " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, Mr Hammond will need more than these windfalls to deliver on Prime Minister Theresa May’s announcement that austerity is over. And he’s not going to miss an opportunity to strengthen the public finances with new taxes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One possibility is that he will choose to freeze the personal allowances for income tax, pushing a larger number of people into higher tax bands.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In essence, it’s a sleight of hand, a hidden income tax increase, but it does break an election manifesto pledge not to raise income tax. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other targets include the tax relief granted for pensions savings, which Mr Hammond has described as ‘eye-wateringly’ generous. They particularly benefit more affluent households, and successive Chancellors have had them in their sights.</p><img id="i-443c931015b23782" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/29/00/5507288-0-image-a-21_1540773961772.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="In essence, it’s a sleight of hand, a hidden income tax increase, but it does break an election manifesto pledge not to raise income tax" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">A near certain target is contract workers in the private sector. They currently escape national insurance and income tax requirements by working as independent contractors. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The measure, already applied to the public sector, could eventually raise up to £1billion for the Exchequer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A range of ‘sin taxes’ on offshore gambling, tobacco and alcohol are also expected.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More controversial would be a rise in insurance premium tax, paid on car and home policies, and lowering the threshold at which firms start to pay VAT from the current figure of £85,000 – far higher than most of the EU.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, the most crowd-pleasing tax the Chancellor could impose would be on digital behemoths such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook, which earn billions of pounds in Britain but pay virtually no corporation or company taxes of any size.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Hammond wants to bring them within the tax net, possibly through a ‘user levy’, which would impose a charge for each click. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But such a sophisticated levy will take some years to implement. As an interim measure the Treasury favours a tax on turnover or sales (as opposed to profits).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Certainly, the Chancellor is going into the budget in a much stronger position than he could have hoped for just six months ago, courtesy of an economy that has expanded speedily enough to defy Project Fear and other gloomy forecasts about the impact of the EU referendum.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, as a Tory Chancellor he must not sacrifice the hard-won fiscal gains of a decade of austerity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Britain still has a legacy of £1.5trillion of national debt, which, at 86 per cent of national output, remains historically high. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, the debt is beginning to fall, but not fast enough for the Chancellor to release the handbrake without public finances going into reverse. Prudence, as ever, must remain the watchword.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>In the weeks and days running up to today’s budget there have been all manner of tantalising pledges hinted at or revealed, more or less something for everyone.

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Unfortunately, it was a dramatic announcement that had been dramatically announced before. At the fateful launch of her Election manifesto in May 2017, the PM also claimed austerity was being junked.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mirroring the omission that had cost Ed Miliband the premiership, she shunned any mention of Britain’s eye-watering debt, and instead pledged lower taxes, record schools funding and the most ambitious programme of investment in the NHS in the nation’s history.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But with no evidence to support her vision of a public sector renaissance that wasn’t funded by soaring taxes, the voters duly gave her plans the raspberry. Last June she had another go. Forget austerity, it was time to splash the cash. In particular, to splash it all over the wards and operating theatres of the NHS.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We cannot continue to put a sticking plaster on the NHS,’ Mrs May declared, before announcing an unprecedented £20 billion increase in the annual budget by 2023. Some of it would be paid for by the Brexit dividend, the rest from other sources, as yet to be determined. But people didn’t need to bother themselves with pedantic queries like ‘where’s the money coming from’?</p><img id="i-956821e39bd3c883" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/28/00/5488128-6324811-image-a-4_1540682564230.jpg" height="460" width="634" alt="As Philip Hammond prepares to stand at the despatch box on Monday to deliver his third – and possibly final – review of the nation’s finances, the fear among his colleagues is that the Chancellor is about to be forced to unveil a tell-don’t-show Budget, at the behest of the tell-don’t-show Prime Minister (pictured before delivering last year's budget)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">They should just celebrate the fact ‘we can secure this great national inheritance for generations to come’, she proclaimed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And again, the people gave the proposal a thumbs-down. Lacking proof that the Government was putting this hypothetical pot of money where its mouth was, only 14 per cent questioned told pollsters MORI they believed the pledge would lead to improvements in the NHS.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet, with the doggedness that has become her hallmark, the Prime Minister has not given up. The details of Monday’s Budget are shrouded in secrecy. But a few themes are emerging. More cash for adult care and defence. More cash in the pockets of the hard-pressed motorist. And, at its heart, the big reveal on how the £20billion for the NHS is going to be funded.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whatever conjuring tricks Hammond deploys will be cheered by Tory MPs. But the political danger for Mrs May is that the public service funding announcement cart is again being placed before the public service delivery horse. As one Minister points out: ‘I’d bite your hand off for that amount of spending for my department, but No10 thinks this is a game changer – but they haven’t thought it through’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In briefings to the Cabinet, Hammond and Health Secretary Matt Hancock have set out the detailed timings of the financial settlement. First there is Monday’s funding statement. Or re-statement. Then, in December, Hancock will publish his ten-year health spending plan, which will detail where the money will be allocated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then, in April, the funds will start to feed through to the front line. But it will be staggered – £4billion in year one, £8billion in year two and £12billion in year three. As Ministers acknowledge, there will then be a further lag before the investment starts to have a perceptible impact on service delivery. And another delay before that impact itself creates a more positive perception among the public of the state of their beloved NHS.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox debate floatRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-2848f700-da41-11e8-b542-7da365566861">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Brexit: The Dirty Harry solution</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <img id="i-e3fd979d09a5a51e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/28/00/5488484-6324811-image-a-23_1540683484678.jpg" height="182" width="274" alt="So, Jacob. Are you feeling lucky?" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the past few weeks, Theresa May’s Brexit opponents have been scheming the overthrow of her Chequers plans and defenestration of her premiership. But her allies are now preparing to fight back. I understand a group of centrist Tories are putting in place contingency plans in the event Chequers is voted down in the Commons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This would involve entering into an unholy alliance with Labour to lock Britain into the single market and the customs union. According to a Minister close to one of the plotters: ‘We can’t have no deal, and we can’t have a situation where the PM is ordered to go back to Brussels to renegotiate with her tail between her legs. So we’re going to present Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group with an ultimatum. If you block Chequers we’ll line up with Labour and force through a single market solution. And see how you like that.’ I’m told up to 30 Tory MPs are considering this ‘Dirty Harry’ option. So, Jacob. Are you feeling lucky?</p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">All this against the backdrop of an annual winter bed crisis, daily Labour taunts of ‘you told us the funding crisis was over!’, and the ominous ticking of the 2022 General Election doomsday clock.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Taken in isolation, these issues would be manageable. But they cannot be taken in isolation. They now need to be set alongside the PM’s wider pledge that austerity is ending across the board.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Calling an end to austerity’s the right approach,’ a Cabinet Minister tells me ‘but you can’t just say it. You have to have a plan for delivering it. And she doesn’t.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Astonishingly, according to another Cabinet insider, the headlines surrounding the austerity section of May’s speech took her and her team by surprise. ‘They didn’t think it would get such a big reaction,’ he explains. It certainly took Hammond by surprise, generating sympathy from normally critical colleagues. ‘I don’t often defend him, but he’s just had this dropped on him,’ one says. A Treasury source tersely confirms ‘it was not done with Philip’s agreement or approval’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From No10’s perspective, an announcement on the formal ending of austerity is essential for wresting control of the domestic – ie non-Brexit – agenda from Jeremy Corbyn’s icy, socialist grip.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He’s been successful in drumming in “austerity, austerity, austerity”,’ a No10 official says. ‘Now we have to begin drumming in “austerity’s over, austerity’s over, austerity’s over”.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But some Cabinet Ministers believe this represents a strategic misstep. ‘We can’t win an argument with Corbyn on who’s going to spend the most on public services. It’s like saying to someone, “Do you want a half-fat treat or a full-fat treat?” The implication being they will always opt for a full-fat Corbyn over a half-fat May.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Prime Minister’s troubled tenure has been punctuated by some stirring rhetoric: her vow to eradicate the ‘burning injustices’ and her defiant response to the Salzburg ambush where she issued the steely warning ‘let nobody be in any doubt… we are preparing for no deal’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But all too often those words have not been matched by deeds. The multi-billion-pound question is: will this time be any different?</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">After last week’s violent briefing in The Mail on Sunday against Mrs May, Tory MPs were supposed to be toning down the rhetoric.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">After all, it is here in Britain that, as last week’s Mail on Sunday revealed, one Brexit rebel warned Theresa May she should ‘bring her own noose’ to a meeting with Conservative back-benchers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another anonymous briefer told The Sunday Times that ‘the moment is coming when the knife gets heated, stuck in her front and twisted.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet the atmosphere in Parliament remains so poisonous that several MPs have told me they are even avoiding the Tea Room – which normally serves as a relaxing canteen – because they can’t stand the thought of having to sit next to certain colleagues.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The dangerous aggression now demeaning British politics is by no means confined within the Palace of Westminster, however.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some members of the public are losing all sense of decency and self-control, and this wider aggression is particularly destructive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The very first email I opened on Friday, for example, demanded that the Government’s Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins should be ‘strung up’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was a time when most MPs would have expected a threat or a serious insult from members of the public perhaps once or twice a year. Now, thanks partly to the internet, we receive them every day. ‘Go f*** yourself’ is wearyingly common.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, there are more serious problems than rudeness, particularly towards politicians. But it is time to recognise that the violence of public rhetoric has reached a new and dangerous level.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remember, there are some people who treat this talk of knives and nooses as a call to action. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For several years I was bombarded with racist emails, using the N-word and complaining about ‘politician traitors’, from a constituent who gave his name. He didn’t directly threaten me, so I just ignored them. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then I discovered that a police investigation into other matters had revealed he kept an unlicensed gun at his home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am more careful these days.</p><img id="i-8f9c20c7a83fb01f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/27/19/5481844-0-image-a-9_1540666156487.jpg" height="419" width="634" alt="'Thanks partly to the internet, we receive [abuse comments] every day. ‘Go f*** yourself’ is wearyingly common', writes Damian Green.

Thankfully, Stephen survived and was able to resume his full parliamentary duties.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before that, an aide to the former MP Nigel Jones called Andy Pennington had been stabbed to death at a constituency surgery in Cheltenham.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I now take security precautions at my office and at home, which were simply not necessary when I first became an MP.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The mood at Westminster is one of gathering gloom across the parties.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are those who say that we can happily ignore the lies and menaces spread on social media, that what appears on screen really doesn’t matter, that anything goes on the web, and so on. But such people have their heads in the sand. However shallow the anonymous rantings of social media might seem, they affect the real world, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And this brings us back once again to events in America, a place where politics now involves bombs and weapons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">President Trump, the master of divisive rhetoric, has played an inglorious role. He plumbed new depths of personal attack when he whipped up crowds against Hillary Clinton, calling her ‘Crooked Hillary’ and encouraging chants of ‘Lock her up’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His response in the aftermath has been to blame the media for fomenting discord, a stance which takes a degree of nerve on his part.</p><img id="i-87dafebcaaae1a4d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/27/19/5481936-0-image-a-10_1540666299266.jpg" height="431" width="634" alt="As last week’s Mail on Sunday revealed, one Brexit rebel warned Theresa May she should ‘bring her own noose’ to a meeting with Conservative back-benchers" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Trump is not the only guilty party. Neither Left nor Right has a monopoly of virtue when it comes to smearing opponents. In the run-up to the 2014 Scottish referendum, the so-called ‘Cybernats’ filled the internet with hatred of their Unionist opponents.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Brexit referendum and its aftermath have followed the same course. If you only took your news from social media (as too many people now do), you would assume that all Brexiteers were racists who hated the modern world, or that all Remainers were out-of-touch intellectuals who loathed Britain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is no way to bring the country together.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These are dark times and we must all play our part in trying to alleviate the climate of aggression. However much we may disagree, others have a right to their point of view.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For unless we establish a more civilised political conversation, and urgently, we will find ourselves condemned to a debased and potentially lethal form of politics – as Americans know all too well and, as I fear, we will soon discover for ourselves.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>After all, it is here in Britain that, as last week’s Mail on Sunday revealed, one Brexit rebel warned Theresa May, above, she should ‘bring her own noose’ to a meeting with Conservative back-benchers.

Chancellor Philip Hammond must do so as well.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So far, he has been a frankly mediocre and low-grade holder of a great office. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He carries his Treasury Red Box with the tentative air of a man who has been awarded the job due to some dreadful error.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, in this year's Budget, he — and the PM — can benefit from a staggering slice of luck if they choose to do so.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Office for Budget Responsibility — the supposedly independent body which makes official economic forecasts — has got it wrong once again. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The British finances are stronger than the OBR predicted — releasing billions of pounds into the national coffers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yippee! But what will the pair do with it? I'm afraid to say that the signs are ominous. Three weeks ago, Mrs May announced an end to austerity. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Beyond question, this remark was based on foreknowledge of those recovering government finances, and the PM seemed to be hinting at an impending spending splurge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As I have said before, such an attack of Corbynitis would be most regrettable.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">So today I issue a friendly warning to both Mrs May and Mr Hammond and offer some words of advice. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">First and foremost, they must not forget a key group of voters who help put the Tories into power — the self-employed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If any single group defines what modern Britain stands for, it is them. Small businessmen and women who are self-reliant because they have to be. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They create wealth and employment — and, above, all they pay their taxes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To their eternal shame and discredit, the Cameron governments waged economic war on them, treating them as cash cows, taxing them at every move, and squeezing their living standards in an unforgivable way. This must be redressed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Hammond should abandon all thought of reducing VAT thresholds, thus adding yet further to the bureaucratic burden they face.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Chancellor also needs to lower taxes on small businesses, and cease to use them as agents of the state, forcing them to collect useless data while imposing ever more ludicrous health and safety demands.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This brings me directly to the second injustice that Mrs May and Mr Hammond must remedy. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It concerns the huge international corporations — above all the tech giants such as Amazon, Google and Facebook — who profiteer at British taxpayers' expense.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Successive Conservative governments have added grievously to the tax burden of genuine British businesses while letting their international competitors off scot-free.</p><img id="i-25b71403db48b408" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/27/01/5463430-6322639-image-a-4_1540599283693.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Just look at the grisly fate of those retail stalwarts, such as 250-year-old Debenhams which is set to close a third of its stores" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let's take the case of Amazon. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As the Mail's Business Editor Ruth Sunderland exposed in a deeply troubling article on Thursday (it ought to be compulsory reading for every minister), Amazon's internet shopping service is destroying Britain's High Streets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just look at the grisly fate of those retail stalwarts, 250-year-old Debenhams, which is set to close a third of its stores, and 169-year old House of Fraser, which went into administration in August.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In stark contrast, in just three months this summer, Amazon racked up international revenues of almost £41 billion. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2017, Amazon UK made £8.8 billion in sales yet paid taxes of a derisory £4.6 million (the equivalent of 0.05 per cent).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is disgraceful and there is every reason to suspect that some accounting jiggery pokery — albeit legal — has enabled Amazon to avoid paying its way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To sum up, this morally questionable company is simultaneously destroying conventional retail outlets while costing the taxpayer billions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am heartened by reports today of a planned £1.5 billion rescue package for the High Street, but Philip Hammond will have to do more. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I'm afraid that he has been intimidated by threats from the tech giants, but any British chancellor worth his salt would call their bluff. And if not now, then when?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If Hammond doesn't act against Amazon and its ilk, given the opportunity Jeremy Corbyn most certainly will.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Hammond has plenty of other opportunities for saving money to invest elsewhere. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Slashing the Foreign Aid budget is one priority. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over the past ten years, the British taxpayer has spent well over £100 billion — that's almost £10,000 for every family in this country during a period of supposed economic austerity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has been a disgraceful waste of money, which has lined the pockets of foreign dictatorships and charity fat cats while doing little or nothing to abate poverty. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now is the moment to deal with this scandal, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tens of billions of pounds can also be released by scrapping former Chancellor George Osborne's HS2 vanity project which, while enriching consultancy firms and bosses who seem to come and go with alarming frequency, will blight hundreds of miles of Middle England for the sake of a fractionally quicker journey to Birmingham.</p><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">And what about the 'just about managing' middle-classes or 'Jams' that Mrs May was once so fond of talking about? Everybody earning £46,351 or more is currently taxed at 40 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That tax threshold must be raised to liberate millions of ordinary, decent, hard-working people and give them more spending money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I also believe that the Treasury must turn its attention to those at the bottom of the scale.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unlike the Labour Party, I see the controversial Universal Credit system as a force for good. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, there is no question that there are teething problems with it, and it is causing suffering among some of society's most vulnerable. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Treasury must acknowledge and remedy some of that blatant unfairness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is a challenging and complex Budget to deliver and Chancellor Hammond has a difficult double act to perform. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He needs to release more money where needed, but without letting go of the Treasury's iron grip on public finances.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More than anything, though, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor need to cheer us all up, to remind us of record employment figures, booming exports and falling deficit — and to re-establish a belief in Brand Britain. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And then give us something to cheer about!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The stakes are huge.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The naming of Sir Philip Green in the House of Lords as the businessman accused of sexual harassment must be a great relief to his alleged victims.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Assuming the allegations are true, it is surely deplorable that they should have to rely on the archaic and somewhat questionable principle of parliamentary privilege in order for their supposed tormentor to be identified. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it is equally unacceptable that a newspaper which had spent eight months investigating allegations of racial and sexual abuse of staff should have been prevented by a court from publishing information that was so plainly in the public interest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On Wednesday it had emerged that a wealthy businessman — who we now know to be Sir Philip Green — had won an interim court injunction to stop the Daily Telegraph from revealing his name, or the details of the claims of abuse against employees.</p><img id="i-49fa3c5de94138c5" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/26/02/5425904-6318629-image-a-18_1540516922769.jpg" height="355" width="634" alt="After a 24-hour guessing game over his identity, the billionaire Sir Philip Green was named in the Lords yesterday when former Labour minister Peter Hain used Parliamentary privilege (above)." class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-d24780a8adb92f34" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/26/01/5419022-0-image-a-1_1540513231372.jpg" height="912" width="634" alt="'The naming of Sir Philip Green (pictured with his wife Tina) in the House of Lords as the businessman accused of sexual harassment must be a great relief to his alleged victims.'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Overturning the previous ruling of a High Court judge, three judges in the Court of Appeal, led by the Master of the Rolls, issued an injunction against publication on the grounds that the tycoon’s victims had all signed so-called non-disclosure agreements, presumably in return for a financial settlement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Telegraph itself had not signed such an agreement. It was merely in receipt of information from those who had. And that information strongly suggests that the then unnamed businessman had used his power and wealth to silence his alleged victims.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The contention of the BBC’s legal correspondent, Clive Coleman, on Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday, was that these non-disclosure agreements were ‘freely’ entered into by the women concerned. But how does he know? Is it not possible that some coercion was involved?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why did the three judges side with the billionaire Sir Philip Green? Partly because non-disclosure agreements are regarded by the courts as documents of almost sacred standing.</p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">But it is also difficult not to conclude that the judges had a natural inclination to defend the privacy of an enormously rich man against the rights of a supposedly free Press. This is a disturbing thought.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No doubt they genuinely believed that they were administering the law impartially. But why — in contrast to the High Court judge who found in the Telegraph’s favour — did they not allow considerations of public interest to be paramount?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The case recalls the hundreds of injunctions and so-called super-injunctions which have been handed out by judges under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act to protect the privacy of wealthy men — it is usually men — with large cheque books.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2011, in a case that carries echoes of Sir Philip Green, the footballer Ryan Giggs was named by a Liberal Democrat MP under parliamentary privilege. Giggs’s sexual shenanigans were of scant interest in themselves. The issue then, as now, is the ability of powerful men to keep stories out of the Press.</p><div class="item">

Some of them even concerned large companies anxious to prevent allegations about their commercial affairs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Plus ca change. My fear is that some judges have a predisposition in favour of protecting the privacy of very rich men, and a prejudice against the rights of the media to report what is in the public interest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is why, though welcome, Theresa May’s undertaking on Wednesday to end the use of ‘unethical’ non-disclosure agreements is unlikely to lead to complete transparency so long as the freedom to publish meets with an in-built resistance in the courts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As the Prime Minister noted, ‘sexual harassment in the workplace is against the law’. That is why it is shaming — as well as alarming — that three very senior judges should have sided with Sir Philip Green against the rights of a free Press.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>STEPHEN GLOVER: The naming of Sir Philip Green in the House of Lords as the businessman accused of sexual harassment must be a great relief to his alleged victims.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">There I was, thinking myself the world's wettest dad for feeling the pangs of Empty Nest Syndrome when the youngest of our four boys started at uni, leaving us alone in the house for the first time since the birth of our eldest 26 years earlier.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But now it seems that even the most macho of men can suffer this same aching sense of hollowness and loss when their young leave home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Step forward, effing and blinding, that muscle-bound tornado of testosterone Gordon Ramsay.</p><img id="i-eac3c6e946b94e02" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/26/01/5424826-6318589-image-a-1_1540513283283.jpg" height="357" width="634" alt="This week, the country's most foul-mouthed and belligerent chef admitted on an American chat show that he's been going through emotional agonies since he packed off his 18-year-old son, Jack, to begin his course at Exeter" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">This week, the country's most foul-mouthed and belligerent chef admitted on an American chat show that he's been going through emotional agonies since he packed off his 18-year-old son, Jack, to begin his course at Exeter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, Empty Nest Syndrome appears to have affected him in the strangest and — dare I say it? — creepiest of ways.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Goodbyes</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As he told viewers of James Corden's Late Late Show: 'I went upstairs to Jack's bedroom last weekend and I opened the door.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let's just say that my Harry's flight from the family nest didn't take me in quite the same way. But how well I remember the autumn morning seven years ago when we said our goodbyes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The previous evening, we had driven him to Sheffield in a car crammed with luggage, books, a computer and stereo equipment. After dropping him at his digs, Mrs U and I went off to a B&amp;B, telling him we'd treat him to a farewell lunch before driving home the next day.</p><img id="i-47cb57518d36f05e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/26/01/0631E0FF000007D0-6318589-image-a-2_1540513356890.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Let's just say that my Harry's flight from the family nest didn't take me in quite the same way. But how well I remember the autumn morning seven years ago when we said our goodbyes" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But when we caught up with him in the morning, he was surrounded by his new flatmates and clearly desperate for us to leave him to start his new life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As I noted here at the time, we took the hint, scrapped the lunch idea and, anxious not to embarrass him with any display of emotion in front of his new friends, we said our very British farewells. Everything we had wanted to say went unsaid: how much we loved him and would miss him, how proud of him we were and how sure he'd have a grand time at Sheffield.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, his mother kissed him on the cheek, while I gave him a manly slap on the back and said: 'Bye, old chap. Good luck.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Bye Mum. Bye Dad.' And that was that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I remember best the drive home to London as we embarked on this new phase of our life — alone together for the first time in more than a quarter of a century and returning to an empty house.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As I recorded in 2011, in the car on the way home Mrs U put on the first CD that came to hand, which happened to be the sublime Joni Mitchell's Wild Things Run Fast. It couldn't have been a more appropriate choice to reflect her feelings.</p><img id="i-5b7e910aaa9f0b59" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/26/01/0002A08D00000C1D-6318589-We_had_driven_him_to_Sheffield_in_a_car_crammed_with_luggage_boo-m-21_1540513727988.jpg" height="419" width="634" alt="We had driven him to Sheffield in a car crammed with luggage, books, a computer and stereo equipment" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">She played it again and again, brushing away motherly tears as we listened to the lyrics of Chinese Cafe: 'With the kids nearly grown and gone/ Grown so fast/ Like the turn of a page/ We look like our mothers did now/ When we were those kids' age/ Nothing lasts for long/ Nothing lasts for long/ Nothing lasts for long.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the full force of Empty Nest Syndrome didn't hit me until the following days at home, when everything seemed so quiet and strange.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the first time in an age, every room was immaculately clean. The dishwasher and washing machine stood idle for days. We bought milk one pint at a time, instead of a minimum of four.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were no fights to break up. There was no stumbling downstairs in the morning to find the house strewn with strange teenagers, slumped asleep on floors and sofas after one of the boys' nights out with his mates. It was all very eerie and unsettling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, no, though I missed Harry terribly in those early days, I never felt remotely tempted to mope in his bedroom — let alone to slip on his underpants or any socks he might have left behind.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Freedom</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It sounds as if Ramsay is afflicted even worse than I was. And the remarkable thing is that the nest he shares with his wife Tana isn't even empty of young.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">True, three of their four children have taken flight — with Jack at Exeter, twin sister Holly in university halls in London and Megan, 20, studying psychology at Oxford Brookes. But they also have a 16-year-old daughter, Matilda, who as far as I'm aware remains on the family premises. Indeed, her dad says he now hopes she will stay at home until she is 25.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All I can say is: be careful what you wish for, Gordon. If my experience is any guide, the worst of Empty Nest Syndrome wears off after a couple of weeks, to be supplanted by a delicious sense of freedom and calm.</p><img id="i-809252aff2001320" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/26/01/5424964-6318589-image-a-13_1540513660255.jpg" height="357" width="634" alt="All I can say is: be careful what you wish for, Gordon. If my experience is any guide, the worst of Empty Nest Syndrome wears off after a couple of weeks, to be supplanted by a delicious sense of freedom and calm" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">You'll appreciate being able to watch what you like on TV, without having to wrestle for the remote with a teenager who wants to stick with the football when a costume drama is starting on the other side. (OK, I guess you'd want the football — but you get the idea).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You'll also be able to cook whatever you fancy at home, without having your diet dictated by a fussy teenager. In my case, it was a joy to have mushrooms and green peppers back on the menu when Harry headed north.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So my advice to Mr Ramsay is that he should enjoy it while he can. For in those wise words of the great Joni Mitchell: 'Nothing lasts for long.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If his lot are anything like mine, they'll be back before he knows it, messing up the house, dictating the menu, hogging the remote and leaving wet towels on the floor as if they'd never gone away. Then he'll look back and pine for a return to that brief time when the nest was empty.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, no sooner had Harry finished his Sheffield course than he was back at Utley Towers. And there he remains to this day, aged 25, with every appearance of being a permanent fixture. Like so many of his boomerang generation, in these days of astronomical house prices and rents, he can only dream of affording a place of his own.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Bombshell</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To be fair to him, he's not all that much trouble. He's become semi-domesticated with the passage of the years, cooking the occasional divine curry and just once in a while hanging up his towel after a shower. Better still, he's learned not to attack me for my Conservative opinions or my support for Brexit, accepting philosophically that he's never going to convert me into an admirer of Jeremy Corbyn or Jean-Claude Juncker.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don't tell him I said this, I beg you, but there have even been moments when I've been pleased to have him about the place.</p><img id="i-620b5d12205d9697" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/26/01/060FC3DA000007D0-6318589-image-a-22_1540513826930.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="To be fair to him, he's not all that much trouble.

She casually remarked that our 27-year-old — by far the most zealous Corbynista of the four — has suffered some glitch in his flat-sharing arrangements and plans to move back home. He's expected today.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So I suppose I must just strap on my tin hat and prepare to be lectured ad nauseam about the evil of my old-fashioned Tory opinions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Never mind that throughout history, every experiment in hard-Left socialism has ended in poverty and misery. In dear Johnny's view, everything will be glorious when Comrade McDonnell is in charge of the nation's purse strings, merrily running up the country's overdraft and transferring ever larger amounts of cash from those who earn it to those who don't, while Jeremy throws tea parties for Palestinian terrorists next door at No 10.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hang on, though. Mr Ramsay has given me a brilliant idea. Perhaps I should start moping around the house in the boys' underwear.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Tonight, after the U.S. stock markets have closed, traders will fall silent as they wait for the latest update from the colossal, world-conquering corporation that is Amazon.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sales by the internet shopping behemoth will be stupendous. In the space of a mere three months over the spring and early summer, it rang up revenues of nearly $53 billion. In the most recent quarter it is likely to have done even better.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's a testament to the visionary talent of Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and child of a single mother who became the world's richest man with a fortune of around $150 billion.</p><img id="i-7cf5f8fa3fd1ac9d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/25/00/5384504-6314007-image-a-17_1540424123058.jpg" height="417" width="634" alt="The latest evidence of Amazon's might is maddening when you consider its derisory £4.67 million bill last year in UK corporation tax, writes RUTH SUTHERLAND " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Scorn</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But while this is a true corporate triumph, the latest evidence of his company's might is maddening when you consider its derisory £4.67 million bill last year in UK corporation tax. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is a piffling sum — and one surely driving Chancellor Philip Hammond to distraction as he prepares for his Budget on Monday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For everything about Amazon is big with a capital B — except its British corporate tax bill, which can only be described as insultingly tiny.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet far from being abashed, the company and the well-paid lobbyists who act on its behalf are brazen in their efforts to maintain tax advantages.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an outrageous attempt to hold Mr Hammond to ransom, an industry group representing the U.S. company and its fellow tech giants have sent a letter threatening to pull investment from this country after Brexit if he dares to put a tax on digital sales (as opposed to the current levy on profits, which are far smaller thanks to clever accounting).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lobbyists for Amazon and its peers even had the gall to depict a digital sales tax as a 'smash and grab raid', as if the Chancellor were threatening to put a stocking over his head and reach for his cosh.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hammond should treat this cheap threat with the scorn it deserves. Amazon is no poor, innocent victim of a larcenous Treasury. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is one of the biggest, richest businesses on this planet. It doesn't take a retail genius to see that the relentless rise of Amazon has coincided with, if not precipitated, the crisis in the British High Street, of which Debenhams is just the latest example.</p><img id="i-92f5f321e13e4eec" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/25/00/5384508-6314007-image-a-18_1540424129422.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Everything about Amazon is big with a capital B ¿ except its British corporate tax bill, which can only be described as insultingly tiny, writes RUTH SUTHERLAND " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course the wider trend for online shopping is also to blame — but Amazon is on its own in terms of size and influence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there are the stories — routinely denied — about underpaid and over-worked warehouse staff. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's no coincidence, perhaps, that Amazon has recently tried to defuse such bad publicity by raising its rates of pay and boasting that it's creating a thousand high-tech roles in the UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there is another reason Amazon should be forced to pay a larger amount of tax: it would secure the goodwill of British consumers who continue to have a love-hate relationship with this tax-avoiding American behemoth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Millions of us — me included — are addicts who have come to depend on its speed, convenience and competitive prices. We may like the idea of browsing in a quirky independent bookshop, but our lives are too busy. Instead we feel a shiver of guilt as we click and download a novel instantly to our Kindles instead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The last thing I want is to feel compelled to boycott the company. What I — and I suspect most people — would like is to get my Amazon fix without constantly feeling enraged that it's taking the government, and taxpayers, for mugs.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The company and its cheerleaders should remember that it prospers in Britain thanks in large part to our taxes. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Who does Amazon think paid to educate its British workforce; or for the NHS that looks after its staff; or the roads on which its vans deliver parcels? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An examination of Amazon's statistics is enough to show how inadequate its British tax contribution really is.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It employs 575,000 people across the globe, not far off the population of Luxembourg, and its retail operations are merely one element of the business. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most people don't realise Amazon is the biggest investor in the world in so-called cloud computing (where remote servers store vast amounts of data — for a fee).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Amazon shares have risen by around 80 per cent in the past year, and its value on the U.S. stock market briefly topped one trillion dollars in the autumn.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All of which means there is no sane universe in which it's acceptable for Amazon to pay so little corporation tax here.</p><img id="i-d9af2fa96475b2e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/25/00/5384526-6314007-image-a-19_1540424133337.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="An examination of Amazon's statistics is enough to show how inadequate its British tax contribution really is, writes RUTH SUTHERLAND " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The company says it hands over all taxes that are due to the British Exchequer. According to the letter of the law, that's correct. But so what? That does not make the situation morally defensible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The technical reason the firm's tax bill is so small is that corporation tax is levied on profits, not sales. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And here's the rub: Amazon's profits are relatively low, because it has been a big investor in this country and can offset investment costs against earnings, to reduce the bottom line.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Danger</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its sales, however, were a hefty £8.8 billion in the UK in 2017, the relevant period.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In any case, there's no need to descend into the dark corners of tax policy to see that the amount it paid to HMRC is minuscule in proportion to the epic scale of its business.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Philip Hammond has made no secret of the fact he would like to impose a digital tax. He has held off thus far because he would prefer to act in concert with his international counterparts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The danger is that if the UK takes action alone then tech companies may seek a more congenial regime elsewhere, at the cost of British jobs. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the EU has been hamstrung in toughening its tax regime, mainly because member states like Luxembourg and Ireland have shamelessly courted digital businesses by offering them tax breaks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Treasury officials say Philip Hammond is prepared to go it alone early next year if the EU is still not ready to act.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a first step, he may impose a tax on revenues rather than profits, and later there might be a complicated formula to tax such firms based on the value of UK customers' data.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there is scope for more imaginative solutions to the digital tax dilemma.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Abuse</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Companies have moved into the 21st century, but governments are still trying to tax them using a system invented for an earlier era.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The good news is that the technology which has reaped so much money for companies like Amazon could also enable policymakers to come up with creative forms of tax collection.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They could, for instance, levy a micro-tax on the likes of Amazon every time a customer clicks the Buy button. It would soon add up to substantial sums, as well as being impossible to avoid.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They might be tempted to raise prices, but the cut-throat competition they created on the internet would limit scope for passing the tax onto customers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The biggest benefit, though, is that it would be easy to collect and hard for firms to manipulate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also, Amazon began life as a bookshop, so how about a tax based on its UK book sales to fund the public libraries closing at an alarming rate?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before the financial crisis, companies prided themselves on paying as little tax as possible. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is no longer socially acceptable. We have come to recognise that paying the bare minimum amounts to a contemptuous abuse of taxpayers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So yes, Amazon is a welcome investor in this country, but it's time it treated taxpayers with respect. If it continues to show disdain, the Chancellor must step in.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The latest evidence of Amazon's might is maddening when you consider its derisory £4.67 million bill last year in UK corporation tax, writes RUTH SUTHERLAND.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ruth Sunderland for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-25T01:54:25.000+02:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>RUTH SUNDERLAND: Amazon must stop treating taxpayers with such disdain</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-25T01:54:25.000+02:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/25/00/5384504-0-image-a-23_1540424245241.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1104735</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>AP</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6313843/QUENTIN-LETTS-Theresa-Prime-Ministers-Questions.html" title="QUENTIN LETTS: Forget about Brexit at PMQs this week – MPs asked Mrs May some easy-peasies on jazz and whisky "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6314009/Brits-borrowed-record-10-7billion-credit-cards-month-industry-figures-show.html" title="Brits borrowed a record £10.7billion on their credit cards last month, industry figures show "></link></item><item><title>Will you be lucky enough to find a 'gold leaf' poppy?

For the lucky ones will find they have a special poppy ahead of this very special Remembrance Sunday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ostensibly, every poppy is identical but one in six will be different this time. They will have '1918-2018' printed in gold on the leaf attached to every stem. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The idea is to encourage people to take a closer interest in this sacred symbol.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Children will, of course, be particularly keen on the idea. There will be much poking around every tray in search of this one-off trophy poppy. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If it means people end up buying a few more than usual, all the better.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even rarer than the 'gold leaf' poppy will be the 'khadi' poppy, made not from paper but from the same Indian linen worn by Mahatma Gandhi. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Around 40,000 of these have been produced, in honour of the 74,000 Indian Army troops who lost their lives in the service of the Crown in the Great War.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the Royal British Legion is gearing up for the biggest Poppy Appeal in its history. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This morning, veterans and their families will gather at specially decorated sites all over the United Kingdom to kick off a campaign that aims to raise a whopping £50 million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not since the American academic Moina Michael first had the idea of wearing a red poppy in 1918 — inspired by Lt-Col John McCrae's poem which begins 'In Flanders fields the poppies blow' — has the Legion been so ambitious.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As ever, the Legion in Scotland will be running its own distinctive appeal (with its own slightly different poppies).</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">A hundred years may have passed since the end of the Great War but the Legion's work is as vital as ever. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Each year it helps hundreds of thousands of people in myriad ways, servicemen and women of all conflicts and campaigns, plus their loved ones.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It supports D-Day heroes and it helps people such as Chantelle Wynn, 42, widowed with two young children after their father, Ryan, returned from Afghanistan in 2006 so broken that he took his own life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet this is about more than fundraising. It is about ensuring we keep the flame of remembrance going at a time when there have seldom been more external forces working to snuff it out.</p><img id="i-727e78bc17f4f674" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/24/23/5383236-6313833-image-a-10_1540421224946.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Two weeks ago the student union at Cambridge University (pictured) rejected a motion to make greater efforts to recognise Britain¿s war veterans and war dead" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Take the latest depressing exchanges at Cambridge University, where two weeks ago the student union rejected a motion to make greater efforts to recognise Britain's war veterans and war dead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It initially accepted an amended motion which deleted the words 'British war veterans', 'Remembrance Day' and 'valour, courage and heroism', arguing that they did not reflect the university's status as an international institution. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rather than 'valorising' war, the university needed to remember 'the lives and deaths of all those who have been affected by war globally'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The union finally decided to drop that motion, too, because it was too vague.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the damage was done. A predictable media storm ensued. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The students involved have since blamed the Press for stirring things up and for the inevitable 'death threats' from online trolls.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This week, however, the union had a rethink and finally did pass a new motion stating that it was, after all, 'important to remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice, in particular during the First World War'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Very generous of them (although I see that seven members of the council abstained).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, we can put this down to silly student politics — which it clearly was. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the other hand, it carried unavoidable echoes of the 1933 debate at the Oxford Union (a debating society rather than a student union), when students passed the motion that they would 'in no circumstances fight for King and Country'.</p><img id="i-5c58fc3817f7ec72" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/25/01/5383494-6313833-St_John_Ambulance_will_allow_its_staff_to_wear_pacifist_white_po-a-1_1540427874552.jpg" height="461" width="634" alt="St John Ambulance will allow its staff to wear pacifist white poppies on Remembrance Sunday for the first time" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Years later, Winston Churchill wrote that this one student debate had played a part in the war 'calculations' of Germany and Japan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Cambridge saga will certainly not have had any such consequences. But it illustrates a direction of travel. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Likewise, the decision of St John Ambulance to allow its staff to wear pacifist white poppies on Remembrance Sunday for the first time, despite critics — including the Tory MP and former Army officer Johnny Mercer — arguing that the symbolism of the poppy is being 'hijacked' by those with a political agenda.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Likewise, last year's Consumer Intelligence report which showed that a third of those under 25 feel uncomfortable about wearing a red poppy on the grounds that it 'glorifies' war.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It does no such thing. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As every Royal British Legion tin-shaker will point out, wearing a poppy is simply an act of thanks to previous generations who died for our right to wear or not wear a poppy — and, indeed, our right to wear a white one, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, it is not just educated people and the usual Corbynista brigade who think it is time to move on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The poor old poppy is up against the brainless, too. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In honour of this year's centenary, there are two excellent campaigns running across the country. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A consortium of military charities led by Lord Dannatt, former Chief of the Defence Staff, is behind those transparent lifesize military figures popping up in public places to promote the message 'There But Not There'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Royal British Legion has organised a similar campaign called 'Silent Silhouettes', lifesize wooden cut-outs of Great War servicemen and women.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You may well have seen some of these in churchyards, parks, schools or football grounds. </p><img id="i-2d831f172077141" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/24/23/5382942-6313833-image-a-2_1540420633378.jpg" height="429" width="634" alt="Last year¿s Consumer Intelligence report showed that a third of those under 25 feel uncomfortable about wearing a red poppy on the grounds that it ¿glorifies¿ war" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are a simple way of reminding us of the losses felt at the heart of every community when a generation goes off to fight a war.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet barely a day passes without news that yet another one has been smashed up or decapitated. In the past few days, a 'silent soldier' had his head broken off in Ross-on-Wye and another, in Market Deeping, Lincolnshire, had his rifle snapped away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If this can be written off as mindless criminality, even more disgraceful is the way in which organised crime is seeking to make money out of the dear old poppy. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For, though it beggars belief, there is now a market in Remembrance fakes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last year, Border Force officers at Tilbury Docks managed to intercept a shipment of bogus poppy merchandise from China worth £150,000. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to a spokeswoman for the Intellectual Property Office, there have been similar detentions at Dover and Heathrow and further details will be announced later this week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All these cases have involved more costly items such as poppy pins, poppy brooches and scarves, rather than traditional paper poppies. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nonetheless, it is shocking that someone in Britain woke up one morning and thought: 'I know. I'll import some fake poppies and make a few quid at the Legion's expense.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, we are talking of a minority here. Up and down the land there are countless delightful and often moving examples of the way people are responding to this centenary.</p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">In Kent, for example, the Marlowe Theatre is taking over the disused Dover Marine railway station, which so many wounded Tommies passed through on their way back from the Front.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the days leading up to Remembrance Sunday on November 11, a professional cast will re-enact the dramatic story of the most famous casualty to pass through this sacred spot — the Unknown Warrior. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He, of course, now resides in perpetuity at the entrance to Westminster Abbey. Tickets are selling fast.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Or take the pupils at Frederick Gough School in Scunthorpe, who were so moved by the story of seven local lads who never came home that they are busy raising funds to buy seven 'silent soldiers' for their local church.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So let's hope the Legion hits its £50 million target. And may your poppy be a golden one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet let us also remember that once this centenary is over, remembrance will be more important than ever.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>This autumn, take a closer look.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">During an unusually sheepish performance on Radio 4’s Today programme, Andrew Bridgen, one of <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/theresa_may/index.html" id="mol-c52bebd0-d722-11e8-bdeb-55edd377376b">Theresa May</a>’s fiercest Tory critics, gave the first clear sign the saboteurs were in retreat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bridgen, who in July was one of the first Tory MPs to reveal he had sent a letter to the 1922 Committee demanding a vote of confidence in the Prime Minister, repeatedly refused to say she should go.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Presenter Nick Robinson brandished yesterday’s Daily Mail front page with the headline about those ‘out to knife Mrs May’ and asked: ‘Are you one of the saboteurs?’</p><img id="i-aa327b45f21e3bcc" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/24/01/5343932-0-image-m-35_1540339867197.jpg" height="539" width="634" alt="Bridgen (pictured), who in July was one of the first Tory MPs to reveal he had sent a letter to the 1922 Committee demanding a vote of confidence in the Prime Minister, repeatedly refused to say she should go" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">The usually forthright Bridgen, who is a regular fixture in radio and television studios, crumpled, saying: ‘Toppling the Prime Minister is not the only solution.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Challenged four times why he had sent the letter in July if he did not want her to quit, Bridgen replied: ‘I did it publicly to put pressure on the Prime Minister to move her political position. I wanted to raise the stakes.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bridgen had gone on air to emphatically deny he was the MP who anonymously told The Sunday Times this weekend of Mrs May: ‘The moment is coming when the knife gets heated, stuck in her front and twisted. She’ll be dead soon.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A Tory MP also said anonymously in The Mail on Sunday that if Mrs May attended this week’s meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee – which was being called a show trial – she should ‘bring her own noose’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Robinson pressed Bridgen as it became clear at Westminster that Tory MPs had started heeding the Mail’s warning not to force a damaging leadership contest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One senior Tory figure and prominent Brexiteer I know had been telling colleagues to abandon talk of a challenge as he believed Mrs May would secure a deal ‘which Parliament could accept’.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">This might explain why Bridgen, a member of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s hardline European Research Group, pulled his punches. Usually he thrives on controversy. In fact, he seeks it out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the weekend, for instance, he was quoted saying: ‘Theresa May will find that she is drinking in the last chance saloon. The bad news for her is that the bar is already dry.’ And when he lodged that letter in July, he said: ‘We either change the Prime Minister’s policy or we have to change the Prime Minister.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He’s got form for challenging Tory leaders. In the summer of 2013, with the Tories lagging behind Labour in the polls, he revealed he had written a letter to the 1922 Committee seeking a vote of confidence in the then party leader David Cameron. A year later Bridgen had changed his mind and sent a public letter informing Cameron he no longer posed a threat to his premiership.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But then Bridgen is used to causing a political stink. Quite literally. In 2014, villagers in his constituency complained that odours from the vegetable processing company AB Produce, which he founded with his brother Paul, were making their eyes water and throats sore.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The smell was caused by waste water from the vegetable preparation process, and Bridgen invested £2million in equipment to treat it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bridgen likes to describe himself as Westminster’s first ‘pre-washed potato magnate’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In June he was in trouble again when he posted a raunchy film clip on a private WhatsApp group used by Cabinet ministers, including the then Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, and Environment Secretary Michael Gove. The video showed provocative close-ups of a woman’s cleavage as a young man tried to impress her with a flashy sports car. The film was posted mistakenly, insisted Bridgen after what he described as a ‘fat finger’ blunder at his computer keyboard.</p><img id="i-bec08244aa3a0d8d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/24/01/5343784-0-image-a-34_1540339862119.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Presenter Nick Robinson brandished yesterday’s Daily Mail front page with the headline about those ‘out to knife Mrs May’ and asked: ‘Are you one of the saboteurs?’" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Bridgen is always willing to give pithy comments on a range of issues, so it was no surprise when he popped up on Sky News after Johnson had said women wearing burkas looked like letter boxes. He said: ‘I feel uncomfortable speaking to a woman in a burka as you can’t see their reaction and it goes against millions of years of human evolution.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An indefatigable campaigner, Bridgen has pursued Labour’s Keith Vaz, a fellow Leicestershire MP, over Sunday newspaper revelations two years ago of him paying rent boys for sex and allegedly offering to buy them illegal drugs. Vaz is now being investigated by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards after a complaint by Bridgen. He is also leading moves for Speaker John Bercow to be investigated over allegations he bullied his former private secretary.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the Commons, Bridgen has one of the best attendance records, having taken part in 92 per cent of votes last year. He made a name as an opponent of the HS2 rail project which slices through his North West Leicestershire constituency.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eyebrows were raised when he sold his eight-bedroom Georgian rectory for £1.9million to the Government department building the rail link. Complete with swimming pool and tennis court, it was sold under the ‘Exceptional Hardship Scheme’ for homeowners whose properties are blighted by the high-speed line.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of his first brushes with adverse publicity came in 2011 when he was arrested after Ukip official Annabelle Fuller made allegations that Bridgen, a father of two, groped her on the balcony of his Westminster flat. The case was dropped within days as there was no evidence. The incident put further pressure on Bridgen’s already troubled marriage, which ended in 2014.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As Bridgen continues to deny he had anything to do with the anonymous quotes about Mrs May, it’s worth recalling a year ago it was yet another Tory leader in his sights.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Enough is enough. The time is over for griping, self-promotion and peacocking across the political stage by Tory MPs determined to undermine their leader.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don’t these posturing rebels understand they are sabotaging the Prime Minister at the most crucial point in our history since the Second World War?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The fact that her own party members should be trying to stop her striking a deal intended to safeguard Britain’s future prosperity is not only deeply disloyal – it is profoundly dangerous.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And if they continue with their wrecking tactics, they could force an election that no one wants and may well usher an unreconstructed Marxist into No 10, with all the ruinous consequences that would wreak on the nation.</p><img id="i-c1776b634e116b62" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/23/03/5306428-6305601-Some_critics_of_Theresa_May_have_faced_heavy_criticism_fro_their-m-18_1540262085332.jpg" height="371" width="306" alt="Some critics of Theresa May have faced heavy criticism fro their language used to attack the Prime Minister" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-4c596fa0bc6d7e18" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/23/03/5306446-6305601-image-a-19_1540262090126.jpg" height="371" width="306" alt="Boris Johnson accused the prime minister of having ¿wrapped a suicide vest¿ around Britain." class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their language in recent days has been loathsome. Like vulgar bit-part players in some gory Shakespearean tragedy, these back-stabbing plotters speak darkly of Theresa May ‘entering a killing zone’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They claim ‘assassination is in the air’, that she is heading for ‘the noose’ and – most egregiously – that ‘the moment is coming when the knife gets heated, stuck in her front and twisted’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Who on earth speaks like that about their worst enemies, let alone their colleagues? Have these people no sense of duty or respect? One can only imagine what constituents think of their ‘honourable’ Members of Parliament.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sadly, these obscure backbenchers (mainly anonymous of course, like cowards down the ages) are not alone in their bid to wreck the Prime Minister’s Brexit plans.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Iain Duncan Smith scuttled off to Brussels yesterday to tell Michel Barnier that the Chequers deal would never get through Parliament and that he should offer Britain a Canada-style deal instead. As a former leader who was brought down by disloyalty, Mr Duncan Smith really should know better.</p><img id="i-e86ef194ff8441be" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/23/03/5306382-6305601-image-a-1_1540261652421.jpg" height="417" width="634" alt="British former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith leaves a meeting with European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium on Monday, October 22" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the Mail’s overriding question is this: What do the conspirators actually think they are going to achieve?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just imagine for a moment they do succeed in toppling the Prime Minister. The result would be a bloodbath – a bitter six-week leadership battle which would convulse the Tory Party, before ripping it apart. The last contest was more in the manner of a coronation, with Mrs May eventually being elected unopposed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This time, it would be a fight to the death, from which the party may not recover for a generation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The arch-Brexiteers fondly imagine that one of their poster boys, Boris Johnson or David Davis, might win. But what then? With just a few months to go to Brexit, what’s their plan? They speak of a Canada-style agreement, but that doesn’t solve the Irish border question and would throw a spanner in the engine of our economy. Then there is the no-deal option, which would involve a hard border around the UK. We may cope, of course, but it would lead to massive disruption and uncertainty for business as Britain reverted to World Trade Organisation tariffs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, any new Prime Minister would have all the same cards as Mrs May has now – and all the same problems. The Parliamentary arithmetic wouldn’t change. They would still be reliant on the Democratic Unionists to get anything done</p><img id="i-1cd341224fbabcbb" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/23/03/5306420-6305601-image-a-4_1540261825763.jpg" height="356" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-1cd340f938fc89db" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/23/03/5306422-6305601-image-a-5_1540261825764.jpg" height="356" width="306" alt="Prime Minister May makes a statement in the House of Commons in London about the European Council" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The overwhelming likelihood would be a period of chaos, followed by another election at which the Tories would inevitably be punished.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brexit of any form would be needlessly imperilled.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If there’s one thing voters hate, it’s a party wracked by civil war. If it can’t govern itself, why should it be trusted to govern the country?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let’s consider the alternative.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Mail is well aware of the shortcomings of the Chequers plan. But the truth is that it’s the only plan on the table – and Mrs May is the only person who can drive it forward. This paper recognises that no one will get everything they want. But we believe that with good faith and unity of purpose, an acceptable outcome is still possible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Prime Minister told the Commons yesterday that the withdrawal terms are ‘95 per cent’ agreed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">True, Northern Ireland remains the main sticking point and she reiterated yesterday that she could never agree to any arrangement which involved separating Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. This is something Brussels must understand if the agreement is to get over the line.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Dominic Raab – who has grown in stature since becoming Brexit Secretary – expressed confidence that a deal could be agreed by November, giving time for all the nations of the EU to approve it before March 29 – the day we formally leave.</p><img id="i-4004b6f96fe3b3ee" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/23/03/5306406-6305601-image-a-2_1540261755365.jpg" height="415" width="634" alt="Britain's Secretary of State for Exiting the EU Dominic Raab leaves Downing Street in London, Britain on Monday" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">So it’s time to face facts. Outside the Westminster bubble, the public are exasperated and exhausted by Brexit infighting and just want a sensible deal to be done – for the benefit of the 17.4 million people who voted Leave, as well as 16.1 million who voted Remain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The dismal consequence could be Corbynism and a return to the economic paralysis and union domination of the 1970s. We know from bitter experience where that ends – with continual strike action, 20 per cent inflation, blackouts and rubbish piling up in the streets. Corbyn’s Labour would lead us to ruin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Tory rebels seem keen on channelling Julius Caesar, so before risking such a calamity, perhaps they should consider this quote from that great tragedy: ‘There is a tide in the affairs of men which, taken at the flood leads on to fortunes. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So of the saboteurs who would take us to the edge of the abyss, this paper asks: Are you really prepared to sacrifice the nation’s fortune on the altar of your own egos? </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>If there’s one thing voters hate, it’s a party wracked by civil war.

Clarity is important.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The real issue, Geoff, is not that you are planning to go from A to B, and the best way of getting there, though that’s certainly up for discussion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The real issue — and it’s an issue that it’s always been my concern to identify — is that I am determined to ensure we deliver the best possible answer as to how to go from B back to A, if and when we need to.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And that’s why we’ve issued what we call the ‘B to A’ plan, so that we can identify the real issues and by doing so reinforce our determination to come up with a ‘Way Forward and Backward’ plan that truly delivers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Q: What sort of clothes should we pack when travelling to Barcelona at this time of year?

And — let me make this quite clear — confusion is not what the British people are after. Or before.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Q: So which is best, Mrs May — a cardigan or a pullover?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Susan, Lancs.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MRS MAY SAYS: </strong>Let me be perfectly straightforward, Susan.

This combines the very best of, on the one hand, the cardigan and, on the other, the pullover.</p><img id="i-b0934c4cc5ebabf2" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/23/01/5304388-6305365-image-a-8_1540256050549.jpg" height="742" width="634" alt="So which is best, Mrs May ¿ a cardigan or a pullover?" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">As we have explained in numerous discussion documents, The Pulligan has no buttons, but does away with the burden of a hole at the top.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And this means that the Pulligan Deal ensures you will be free to walk around with a firm and stable new garment that, by covering your entire head, offers additional protection from the elements.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For this reason, The Pulligan Deal remains by far the best way to guarantee the very best deal that this country deserves, allowing us to go forward — and back — in the years ahead. And that’s why the time has now come to put our future behind us.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Q: I have been planning to follow your example and embark on a walking holiday this year. I notice you always carry two thin sticks with you when you go out walking. Would you recommend that I follow suit, Mrs May, and, if so, why?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Edith, Nuneaton.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MRS MAY SAYS: </strong>Carrying two sticks is the only way to guarantee certainty and stability and to give ramblers the strong and stable walks they demand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But we have got to be realistic about this. Carrying three, four or even five sticks is the only way to satisfy all the different concerns that have been voiced, and six or seven sticks should not be ruled out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are those who argue that carrying eight, nine or ten sticks is too much of a burden for the hard-working individual who wishes to enjoy a short walk in the countryside.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I want us to be ambitious for all walkers, and that’s why I am recommending that 14 or 15 sticks — that’s seven or eight per hand, with three or four more inserted in each boot — will ensure the limits on freedom of movement that the British people continue to demand.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Should you happen to look at the website for Cardiff’s University Hospital of Wales, what you will see is dozens of gleaming photographs of state-of-the-art facilities. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But behind the glass towers, and away from the snazzy entrance hall dominated by cafes and shops, conditions are very different.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The staircases are shabby and dusty, and the stairwells home to discarded wrappers and even the occasional fag-end. The impression is that inside this 1,000-bed medical facility, the appearance of the public passageways is of no importance at all.</p><img id="i-c6ea630e0a7ad00d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/23/01/5303650-0-image-a-18_1540253025963.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Should you happen to look at the website for Cardiff¿s University Hospital of Wales, what you will see is dozens of gleaming photographs of state-of-the-art facilities" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But that is by no means its most serious failing, as my wife and I have discovered over the past decade as witnesses to the conditions both her parents faced at the principality’s flagship hospital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That’s why we were not surprised to read this week of the decision of a senior NHS executive to quit her native Wales after experiencing appalling failings in the treatment of her husband’s prostate cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Until now, our family has remained silent about the University Hospital of Wales, and the second-rate treatment and appalling lack of cleanliness we had seen there in the last days of my father-in-law Saul’s life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A decorated World War II RAF medic, and high-achieving chartered surveyor, Saul, who was bright and alert to the very end of his long life, perished at the age of 96 as a result of a serious infection contracted while he was being treated at the hospital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His wife, Jacqueline, a proud daughter of one Cardiff’s most distinguished commercial families, passed away after experiencing clinical failings herself before she was given a late diagnosis of terminal cancer earlier this year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are two of the very many victims of NHS Wales, where shambolic levels of care have driven one of its most senior bosses, Professor Siobhan McClelland, to move to England to seek better cancer treatment for her husband.</p><img id="i-58f0b6bc97e2fee8" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/23/01/5303644-0-image-a-21_1540253054383.jpg" height="426" width="306" alt="Alex Brummer had remained silent about the appalling lack of cleanliness he saw in the last days of his father-in-law Saul¿s life (pictured)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prof McClelland has held top positions in the Welsh Ambulance Service and on the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, but now says she has lost faith in the ability of the Welsh government to oversee a functioning health policy. And here’s the rub: the horrors my family witnessed were in an NHS run by the Welsh Assembly’s Labour-controlled government.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the House of Commons, the message from the Labour front bench is as relentless as it is misguided: only Labour loves the NHS; only Labour can save the NHS; the Tories hate the NHS and want to privatise it (that’s the same Tories who have just pledged to pump £20billion extra a year into the health service — far more than Labour was proposing).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, would Labour, with their big State approach, really deliver a wonderful NHS? Well, we don’t need to speculate. We have only to look across Offa’s Dyke to see what happens when Labour is actually in charge of a national health service.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The result is an appalling shambles of care. A quick run through of recent stories on the BBC’s news website and elsewhere suggest there are fundamental failures in the system.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One headline reads: ‘A&amp;E performance in Wales worst on record.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another story reports that in Maelor hospital in Wrexham, less than half of patients were seen within the four-hour target time set by the Welsh government. Elsewhere, the Cwm Taf University Health Board is investigating the deaths of 26 babies over three years... and so on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Welsh public sector model is built around a socialist agenda which rejected the private finance initiative contracts that allowed the rebuilding of many of England’s Victorian facilities. That has proved a fatal error for the people of Wales.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Blair-Brown governments were, for example, attacked by the Left when they introduced so-called Independent Sector Treatment Centres, which are private-sector-owned centres used by the NHS in England to treat patients free at the point of delivery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They offer routine procedures such as cataract removals and hip replacements, which take the pressure off other NHS services.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Similarly, the free prescriptions offered to everyone in Wales might be attractive to voters, but they have leached resources away from basic services. Someone always has to pay. </p><img id="i-824fd50a73f6ca7f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/23/01/5303646-0-image-m-23_1540253072004.jpg" height="455" width="634" alt="Decorated World War II RAF medic, and high-achieving chartered surveyor, Saul, and wife Jacqueline" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">If anyone is qualified to provide first-hand testimony of Labour’s rotten health record in Wales, it was Siobhan McClelland.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She accuses the Welsh government of having ‘neither the capacity nor capability’ to run a successful health service. Her husband suffered several failings in his care, including delays in getting GP appointments and subsequent diagnostic services.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her story mirrors that of the Labour MP Ann Clwyd who described how her husband, Owen, died ‘like a battery hen’ after being kept on a trolley in a corridor at the very same University Hospital of Wales where my wife’s father ended his days. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs Clwyd’s reward for highlighting this issue was to be attacked by the Welsh political ruling class. Although the hospital’s health board apologised ‘unreservedly’ about her husband’s care, she was publicly told to shut up and stop complaining by a Labour member of the Welsh Assembly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For my family, it is all horribly familiar.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Admittedly, both my father-in-law and mother-in-law were very elderly when they became victims, in different ways, of NHS Wales. Saul was, partly because of his own medical experiences in the war, fastidious about cleanliness. So it was shocking during his final illness to find him in bedclothes stained with dry blood.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was fully aware of what was going on around him, and distressed by the unhygienic conditions.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">She came to the Commons to make a Statement, nominally about the recent EU summit. She uses these set-pieces to remind the House that she is Still Walking and to give little tilts of one or other wing. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If she favoured a side yesterday it was the Eurosceptics, to a very small extent. She used some of their recent language about how she did not want Britain to be caught in the ‘limbo’ of a never-ending transition period.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Philip Hammond, Chancellor, arrived just after her and stood directly behind her by the Speaker’s Chair while the previous item of business neared its end.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps he thought she deserved the hear-hears on her own. Not that there were many.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The main development at the summit was the idea of extending the ‘implementation period’ (as No 10 calls transition) between our EU exit and ‘the future relationship’. Ministers speak of this ‘future relationship’ in the way cathedral canons speak of the Trinity. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is something they admire intellectually, even if the rest of us find it hard to believe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The extension of that transition period was the stickiest problem for Mrs May yesterday.

I see any extension as undesirable.’ Er, so who first suggested it? It would only be needed, she said, if the negotiating process was ‘not quite ready’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not quite ready? Made it sound like a baked egg.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Not for the first time, Nick Clegg — sorry, that should be Sir Nicholas Clegg — has let down his admirers. To the consternation of those who, like him, have been campaigning to 'stop <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/brexit/index.html" id="mol-05c0b550-d59c-11e8-9eb2-61c414698b63">Brexit</a>', the former leader of the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/liberal-democrats/index.html" id="mol-05c15190-d59c-11e8-9eb2-61c414698b63">Liberal Democrats</a> has abandoned them to join <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sciencetech/facebook/index.html" id="mol-05c10370-d59c-11e8-9eb2-61c414698b63">Facebook</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Specifically, he starts work today as the social media company's 'head of global affairs'. That means the former deputy prime minister will be paid millions to lobby governments and public opinion to see things Facebook's way.</p><img id="i-a7b531dea4159946" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/22/02/5267346-6301573-image-a-1_1540171813799.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Mark Zuckerberg (left) meets former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">We are told that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's dominant shareholder and chief executive, spent months 'wooing' Clegg to take up this job offer. Far be it from me to question Zuckerberg's business acumen, but if he thinks the British people would put any faith in what Clegg says (about almost anything), then the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-05c1edd0-d59c-11e8-9eb2-61c414698b63">California</a>-based billionaire must have been on the wacky baccy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Misjudgment</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Because Clegg — having achieved ephemeral acclaim during the 2010 General Election as the leader of a party that would 'keep its promises, unlike the two old parties' — became a byword for betrayal. The Liberal Democrats' principal campaign pledge — signed personally by every one of its MPs — was to scrap student fees: this was pitched to win the support of younger voters and it was mightily effective in constituencies with high student populations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then, within months of joining government, Clegg instructed his MPs to back the Conservatives in . . . tripling those same university tuition fees. Clegg's misjudgment — to put it politely — led to a cataclysmic drop in support for his party by those same young voters. Eventually, he issued a much-satirised apology on YouTube, saying how sad he was about it.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was demolished by David Cameron's former policy director at No 10, James O'Shaughnessy, who tweeted: 'Clegg [is] talking crap on student fees. He wasn't between 'a rock and a hard place'. I was in the room when he decided to vote for it. He was keen.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not only was this a principal reason (not the only one) for the annihilation of the Liberal Democrats in the 2015 General Election, it contributed to Nick Clegg's ignominious loss of his own seat, in the university constituency of Sheffield Hallam, last year. He's been in need of a paid job ever since: he's certainly got a stonker of a salary now.</p><img id="i-5b6cda8f13d63b1b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/22/09/5273446-6301573-Ten_years_ago_Liberal_Democrats_leaflets_were_scattered_across_t-a-43_1540195930198.jpg" height="877" width="634" alt="Ten years ago, Liberal Democrats leaflets were scattered across the length and breadth of the land, declaring: 'It's time for a REAL referendum on Europe'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">To be fair, Clegg has not been idle since the electors of Sheffield handed out his electoral P45. He has written a book called How To Stop Brexit, a manifestation of his revulsion at the decision of the British people in a referendum to leave the European Union, which he has been determined to overturn.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As with other campaigners in that cause, Clegg argues that the British people had been fooled. Well, referendum campaigns, like general elections, involve propaganda and phoney figures on both sides. But the democrat accepts the outcome. You might think Clegg, above all, would accept that: after all, he was the first leader of a mainstream political party to advocate a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ten years ago, Liberal Democrats leaflets were scattered across the length and breadth of the land, declaring: 'It's time for a REAL referendum on Europe.' And on each was a big photo of Nick Clegg, next to the words 'Lib Dem Leader Nick Clegg: It's time to give the British people a real referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. Sign our petition today.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the then-Speaker of the House of Commons, Michael Martin, refused Clegg's demand for a parliamentary vote on his idea of an in-or-out EU referendum, the Lib Dem leader was so furious that he led his MPs on a stagey flounce out of the chamber in protest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the end, of course, Clegg got his wish for an in-or-out referendum, when the Conservative-led coalition government in which he served as deputy prime minister years later pushed through the necessary enabling legislation. When it eventually took place, his side — to his evident disbelief — lost.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And suddenly, it transpires this was not the 'real' referendum after all. No, that was all a terrible mistake. The 'real' referendum, designed to overturn the result of the very one Clegg demanded, is promoted as the 'People's Vote' — presumably to distinguish it from the one in 2016, which must have involved only non-sentient beings or zombies.<strong> </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Thwart</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clegg was not among the hundreds of thousands of campaigners for the 'People's Vote' who marched in gloriously sunny London on Saturday. Presumably he was too busy preparing for his new Facebook job starting today or, indeed, applying for his 'Green Card' — the far from automatic permit for which immigrants are required to apply if they wish to work in the U.S. (not at all like the EU free movement system of which Clegg is such an advocate).</p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, he could be found pontificating in the pages of the German newspaper Die Welt, in a joint article with former prime minister Tony Blair and former Conservative deputy PM Michael Heseltine under the headline: 'Blair, Clegg and Heseltine: we need another EU referendum'. I raised this with a friend of mine, who has spent some time on government business in the EU over recent months. I remarked to him that this piece was clearly intended to convince German readers that the British political establishment will do what it can to thwart the result of the 2016 referendum, but that surely the Germans must realise these three authors carry no weight whatsoever in the UK, being regarded here as has-beens, discredited, or both.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No, he replied: in the councils of Brussels, and in Berlin, the three are taken very seriously and such an article is read as evidence that there really is a good chance the British establishment will force a second referendum, to keep the UK in the EU. And, he added, it encourages Brussels and Berlin to be even more implacable in their negotiating stance, to add to the attractions of such a 'reconsideration'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, it was all along the view in the Chancelleries of Europe that the British people would discover what the peoples of Holland, Denmark and Ireland learned: that if they vote in a referendum against the way that the European Commission and the established parties want (remember that the leadership of all three main British political parties were for Remain), they will be made to vote again until they come up with the right answer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Weakness</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That view in Brussels will be strengthened by a disgraceful speech in Salisbury last week by the former head of MI6, Sir John Sawers. This ex-Foreign Office man (he didn't work his way up the intelligence service, unlike previous occupants of that job) declared his support for a second referendum. And he asserted it was only because the UK had been 'weakened' by Brexit that Russia had dared to attempt to assassinate the British double agent Sergei Skripal: 'Russia was willing to treat Britain with contempt.'</p><img id="i-e57c844e7d38bbe6" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/22/03/0BCE307D000005DC-6301573-Sir_John_Sawers_has_declared_his_support_for_a_second_referendum-m-2_1540174025053.jpg" height="454" width="306" alt="Sir John Sawers has declared his support for a second referendum" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">So how does Sawers explain the fact that the same Russian government used equally deadly poison to assassinate another defector, Alexander Litvinenko, in London in 2006 — ten years before the Brexit vote?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps this unprecedented intervention by an ex-MI6 chief is designed to impress on Berlin or Brussels that the UK is contrite at its voters' impertinence in wanting to leave the institutions of the EU: but Brexit supporters should be heartened that such an ill-thought-out argument is the best that a former so-called 'intelligence' chief can muster.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, it is a glaring weakness of the forces arguing for a 'People's Vote' that there is no one among its leading figures who commands widespread respect. Its main spokesman is Blair's former spin doctor-in-chief, Alastair Campbell; but the propaganda maestro behind the 'dodgy dossier' on Iraq endlessly complaining that Brexit was based on a false prospectus is almost beyond satire.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For similar reasons, those calling for a second referendum should actually be grateful that Nick Clegg is abandoning their cause. Everything he touches turns to ashes.

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">The fact is that the new highly-mobile missiles which Russia has developed undoubtedly make the world a more dangerous place. And Donald Trump’s aggressive chest-beating response risks making an already fraught situation worse.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To understand why, we have to look at how Putin has broken his treaty obligations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty banned Russia from having any land-based intermediate nuclear missiles with a range of more than 300 miles. Sea-launched missiles were allowed however – the theory being that they were more difficult for Russia to hide because the submarines and warships from which they were launched could be tracked by the West.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a result, instead of the lumbering land-based SS20 missiles which worried the West so much in the 1980s, Russia has concentrated over the decades on developing much smaller missiles that can be launched from the sea. Such missiles, albeit without nuclear warheads, were used to devastating effect against rebels in Aleppo in Syria.</p><img id="i-4120acff84b64ebe" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/22/01/5266816-6301483-image-a-18_1540169050936.jpg" height="417" width="634" alt="Historic: Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan sign the 1987 treaty " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">What Putin’s technicians have now done is to adapt these Kalibr sea-launched systems to make land-based cruise missiles capable of being transported by small trucks. They can be moved across country at 50mph and it would be impossible to track every one of them – making a surprise attack technically possible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the missiles, which fly under the radar, have been fitted with supersonic boosters which makes them practically impossible to intercept. This puts huge numbers of Nato countries, including Britain, theoretically in the firing line.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why this is so disturbing is that it fits into Putin’s tactical strategy. Today’s Kremlin boss is ruthless, but worse he runs a Russia much less moribund than the wheezing Communist colossus of the 1980s. Putin’s armed forces are much leaner and meaner than in those days.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">War in the 21st century has been practised already from Syria to Ukraine and in cyberspace. Putin knows he doesn’t need two million badly-trained soldiers to be sacrificed in the trenches.</p><img id="i-89f86d925660b095" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/22/01/5266234-6301483-image-a-17_1540167104555.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Trump, in response to Putin’s cheating, is saying he will pull out of the treaty altogether.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">If it comes to war, he’ll need the best cyber-sabotage, the most effective special forces and, crucially, unstoppable medium-range nuclear missiles. Which he now seems to have obtained, despite the treaty.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is why Trump has reacted so vigorously. Playing the tough guy also plays well to his core supporters, and he faces mid-term elections in two weeks’ time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The trouble is that dropping the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty (INF) now might actually suit Russia better in the coming years than the US. While for America, the INF treaty has been a useful bulwark against nuclear escalation, Putin’s strategists have chafed at the restrictions INF imposed on them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By ripping it up, Trump will be criticised by European leaders – Germany was the first US ally to do so, with foreign minister Heiko Maas urging Washington to consider the consequences both for Europe and for future disarmament efforts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All of this will delight Putin because it plays into his divide-and-rule approach to Europe.</p><img id="i-f5321424bc9bf792" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/22/01/5266164-6301483-image-a-15_1540167017598.jpg" height="420" width="634" alt="Without the trust between the US and Russian leaders that existed in Reagan and Gorbachev’s day, diplomacy is on a hair trigger – as in the worst days of the Cold War" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">More worryingly, if Trump does dump the INF agreement, there will be nothing to stop Putin’s generals from building and refining as many of these new faster-than-sound land-based nuclear missiles as possible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other nuclear powers, especially China and probably India and Pakistan, will want to buy them if they can’t build their own.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This technology is so easy to hide, swift to deploy and difficult to stop that it steeply increases the chances of a successful surprise nuclear attack. Worse still, without the trust between the US and Russian leaders that existed in Reagan and Gorbachev’s day, diplomacy is on a hair trigger – as in the worst days of the Cold War.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">President Trump has declared he wants to make America safer but my fear is that he has made the world an even more dangerous place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Mark Almond is Director of the Crisis Research Institute, Oxford</span> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>On Saturday, President Trump told an election rally in Nevada that Russia was cheating on the 1987 arms control treaty which banned land-based cruise missiles in Europe.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">On a typically sunny Friday morning in Jeddah, I found myself driving past the city’s biggest mosque, the vast car park of which doubled as the city’s ‘chop-chop square’ where executions were a frequent occurrence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Friday prayers had just ended, and the crowd gathering outside was surrounded by police cars with their lights flashing. It could mean only one thing. I joined the throng just in time to see two Bangladeshi men – blindfolded and with their hands tied behind their backs – being forced to kneel on the ground. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Amid cries of Allahu akbar – ‘God is greatest’ – they were decapitated by a burly executioner wielding a huge sword, who then held aloft their heads. Welcome, I said to myself with a shudder of horror, to <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/saudi_arabia/index.html" id="mol-e6212300-d588-11e8-a19a-a9080cb8b301">Saudi Arabia</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just a couple of hours later, I was sitting in a Starbucks cafe inside a glitzy mall surrounded by families strolling with their children, mostly dressed in Western clothes and eating ice cream. It struck me that it could have been Knightsbridge in <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-e620add0-d588-11e8-a19a-a9080cb8b301">London</a>.</p><img id="i-f6457eeb66005c16" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/22/00/5264676-0-image-a-1_1540163168748.jpg" height="467" width="634" alt="Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammad bin Salman is greeted by Prime Minister Theresa May at 10 Downing Street on the first day of his three-day visit to the UK in March" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">In that single day I witnessed the deep contradictions that lie at the heart of Saudi society: a country with ultra-modern infrastructure and astonishing wealth created by vast oil reserves, but whose people are repressed by a ruthless Islamic theocracy and a justice system that is almost incomprehensibly medieval.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For all of the Western trappings, the absolute monarchy that rules there will brook no opposition. As I discovered during three years working on a newspaper in Jeddah, all local papers and TV stations are government-controlled.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, the adamantine rule of the courts means that Saudis are unlikely to be mugged as they carry bagfuls of designer shopping back to their cars. Indeed, you probably won’t even see a uniformed police officer. But small wonder given the severity of the punishments, even for petty crimes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2015, a British grandfather faced 350 lashes for possessing bottles of home-made alcohol, a sentence which was suspended only after an outcry in the British Press. Others were not so fortunate.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> A blogger was sentenced to 1,000 lashes for insulting Islam. A Saudi airline employee was jailed for five years and sentenced to 1,000 lashes because he discussed his sex life on TV.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">God help those who refuse to toe the line politically: the secret police will swoop on you in an instant. There are at least 30,000 political prisoners in Saudi prisons, where the conditions are appalling, and torture chambers abound.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for the executions, sometimes those who are beheaded are also crucified. Even stoning and eye-gouging aren’t unheard of. It is literally Biblical. Which is why the events of recent days in Istanbul should come as no surprise to those who have lived in this wrathful Arab kingdom, whose royal house never hesitates to seek vengeance against its enemies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi has dragged Saudi Arabia and its leaders into a global furore that may have profound repercussions for the West’s influence in the Middle East.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What is particularly troubling about this terrible story is that Saudi Arabia’s powerful crown prince and de-facto leader, Mohammad bin Salman, 33, personally stands accused of sending those 15 assassins to murder his most fearless political opponent. They allegedly include a number of his bodyguards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Khashoggi was targeted because he had moved to America, was the most prominent critic of bin Salman, and was about to launch a political party with the goal of overthrowing the Saudi monarchy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Few had heard of him before he disappeared, but his name was all too familiar to me.</p><img id="i-fb403316ff9b11cd" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/22/00/5264902-0-image-a-2_1540163241887.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="Mohammad bin Salman arriving at 10 Downing Street during his visit to the UK earlier this year" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the 2000s, I was a correspondent in Saudi Arabia for a number of Western media outlets, while working as the managing editor of the Jeddah-based daily Arab News. Khashoggi was the deputy editor, and we worked side by side in the office for the best part of three years. Back then, I could never have imagined that one day I would end up covering his atrocious slaying. At the same time, the news from Istanbul was not entirely surprising.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let’s face it, we have been sickeningly aware for as long as we can remember that Saudi Arabia is capable of the worst kinds of crimes against humanity. Even Saudi royalty deemed beyond the pale by the upper echelons have found themselves drugged while living abroad, then whisked back to the kingdom on a private jet – sometimes never to be heard from again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This kind of reckless behaviour happens so frequently because the ruling family are convinced their vast oil wealth means they can do whatever they damn well please.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Until now, that has invariably been the outcome. Even back in the mid-80s, Margaret Thatcher personally lobbied the Saudi royal family, flattering them to secure major arms deals for Britain. Ever since, the West has been caught in this Gordian knot of having to turn a blind eye to terrible human rights abuses in the name of profit and jobs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Only last year, Donald Trump signed $110billion in proposed deals with the Saudis, while the UK issued 126 licences relating to military goods with a value of £1.129billion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is also Saudi Arabia’s key role in supporting US foreign policy objectives in the region, which are centred on containing Iran. Saudi Arabia has formed an unofficial alliance with Israel with that aim, since both the Sunni Muslim kingdom and the Jewish state share a fear of the expansionism and nuclear ambitions of Iran, which follows the rival Shia Muslim faith. Washington worries that a weakened Saudi Arabia will embolden Iran.</p><img id="i-92ef778eb9753fef" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/22/00/5265194-6301363-image-a-6_1540164140526.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The question now is whether, in the wake of the Khashoggi affair, the West has finally had enough, if not of bin Salman, then at least of his excesses" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">This is also why the West has been so reluctant to criticise the Saudi-led war in neighbouring Yemen, where a Saudi bombardment has destroyed the country, leaving 10,000 civilians dead and 15million facing what the UN says could be the worst famine the world has known in 100 years. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This, then, is the backdrop to the diplomatic crisis which has enveloped Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who, let us remember, had tea with the Queen during a state visit in March when the Government rolled out the red carpet for him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s true he has initiated social reforms in the desert kingdom which are welcome, if long overdue. He has sought to curtail the religious police, allowed women to drive, given permission for cinemas and other entertainment venues to open, and relaxed rules restricting how men and women can socialise in public. All of that, though, has come at a massive cost, and it is one which Khashoggi’s murder has finally brought to the world’s attention. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In recent months, Saudi Arabia has entered a downward spiral and is now more tyrannical than ever. In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that bin Salman has emerged as the most paranoid, ruthless and brutal Arab leader since Saddam Hussein. Apart from arbitrarily imprisoning and allegedly torturing leading princes and businessmen during a corruption crackdown, he has detained the families of overseas activists to pressure them into silence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He has overseen the cruel destruction of entire Shia Muslim villages in response to mostly peaceful protests.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The question now is whether, in the wake of the Khashoggi affair, the West has finally had enough, if not of bin Salman, then at least of his excesses. Mr Trump says he is ‘not satisfied’ with Saudi Arabia’s account of Khashoggi’s death – that he died after a fist fight – and has repeated his threat of imposing some form of sanctions against the kingdom.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the danger is that in the end, all of this posturing may amount to very little in terms of concrete measures.</p><img id="i-ca699a57780915db" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/22/18/5265160-6301363-John_R_Bradley_is_the_author_of_Saudi_Arabia_Exposed_Inside_a_Ki-a-3_1540227616330.jpg" height="380" width="306" alt="John R Bradley is the author of Saudi Arabia Exposed: Inside a Kingdom in Crisis" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those decades of arms deals have tied the UK and the US to Saudi in a way that is impossible to untangle, and they have skilfully positioned themselves as a bulwark against America’s regional enemies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No one should dismiss, either, the Saudis’ warning that they will deploy oil supplies as a weapon to retaliate if any kind of sanctions are imposed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">MBS, as he is known, may not have foreseen the firestorm sparked by the targeting of Jamal Khashoggi, but he knows he needs Western economic investment and US political support more than ever.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His task of dragging Saudi Arabia into the 21st century is Herculean, and he is still the kingdom’s best bet in the coming years.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Nobody likes a spoilsport, but somebody has to say it. Those who joined the crowds at the People’s Vote march at the weekend needn’t have bothered, because it will turn out to have been a complete waste of everybody’s time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If recent history teaches us anything, it is that marching through <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-47029420-d588-11e8-b50f-43eaefda911d">London</a>, waving flags and blowing whistles, is a cast-iron sign of a lost cause. Just ask the Aldermaston marchers of the 1960s, the anti-Cruise missile protesters of the 1980s or even the millions who marched against the war in <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/iraq/index.html" id="mol-47026d10-d588-11e8-b50f-43eaefda911d">Iraq</a> in 2003.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In this case, the chances of success seem even more minuscule than usual. Not only has <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/theresa_may/index.html" id="mol-47004a30-d588-11e8-b50f-43eaefda911d">Theresa May</a> explicitly ruled out a second referendum on our deal with the EU, but <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/jeremy_corbyn/index.html" id="mol-46fd8b10-d588-11e8-b50f-43eaefda911d">Jeremy Corbyn</a> has shown no interest in having one either. Even in the event that our negotiations with the EU collapse, the chances of the Commons voting for a second referendum seem vanishingly small. But even if there were a chance of another referendum, I think it would be absolutely wrong to seize it.</p><img id="i-de5a1ecb3d4692f4" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/22/00/5264898-0-image-a-6_1540163221704.jpg" height="424" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">A second referendum would be a disgraceful betrayal of democracy and an insult to the 17.4 million people who voted in 2016 – and I write that as somebody who voted Remain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Almost everything about the so-called People’s Vote effort is bogus. It claims to be a ‘grassroots campaign’, yet its headquarters are in Millbank Tower, the architectural embodiment of the Westminster establishment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Far from being organised from the bottom up, it is actually a front for the lobby group Open Britain, a direct successor of the Remain campaign. It is backed by such ‘grassroots’ Britons as Lord Mandelson, Sir Vince Cable and Sir Nick Clegg, while its online adverts rely heavily on millionaire celebrities such as Gary Lineker, Patrick Stewart and Steve Coogan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The very name People’s Vote is, of course, pure spin. We already had a people’s vote in 2016 – the biggest in history. Yes, it was close. But that’s democracy for you. In any case, what do the People’s Vote campaigners actually want? They claim they want a ‘vote on the deal’, but this is blatantly not true.</p><img id="i-5afa2638700c5159" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/22/00/5264688-6301287-image-a-2_1540163063912.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="If recent history teaches us anything, it is that marching through London, waving flags and blowing whistles, is a cast-iron sign of a lost cause" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">If they were honest, which they are not, they would admit that they really want to re-run the 2016 referendum. None of their major backers or celebrity supporters just wants to adjust the deal; they want to reverse the entire process.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Given that I voted Remain the first time, you might expect me to agree with them. Yet I believe a second referendum would be the worst thing that could possibly happen to British democracy. And in supporting one, however disingenuously, the People’s Vote campaigners are exposing their own arrogance, snobbery and intolerance. Ever since the polls closed on June 23 two years ago, the ultra-Remainers have acted as if voting to leave the EU was an act of pathological insanity, ignorance and bigotry.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the plain fact is that people have been arguing about our place in Europe since well before we joined the Common Market way back in 1973. Among those who argued that we should either stay out or leave were the likes of Clement Attlee, Hugh Gaitskell, Barbara Castle, Enoch Powell, Michael Foot, Tony Benn, Denis Healey, Nigel Lawson, Norman Lamont and David Owen. Were they all ignorant bigots? I don’t think so.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet I have lost count of the number of times I have heard supposedly intelligent people, among them plenty of Oxford and Cambridge academics, insisting that the British people were too stupid or too prejudiced to decide correctly, and should be compelled to vote again until they get it right. Just imagine if Parliament agreed with them and passed a bill to require a second referendum. What message would that send to the millions who voted the first time?</p><img id="i-204c22e35156341f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/22/00/5264672-6301287-image-a-4_1540163087099.jpg" height="424" width="634" alt="Not only has Theresa May explicitly ruled out a second referendum on our deal with the EU, but Jeremy Corbyn has shown no interest in having one either" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Wouldn’t it suggest that the politicians see themselves not as the servants of the people, but as their masters, whose wishes must be obeyed at all costs? The People’s Vote website claims that ‘new facts have come to light about the costs and complexity of Brexit that no one could have known at the time’. But this is a barefaced lie. Back in 2016, the Remain campaign insisted, again and again, that leaving the EU would be immensely expensive and difficult. And while it has shown a wobble or two, the economy has conspicuously failed to collapse in ruins, contrary to George Osborne’s hysterical predictions. Despite apocalyptic warnings, 17.4 million people decided that it was worth doing anyway, because they considered it a price worth paying for separation from the EU.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the time, official leaflets about the referendum explicitly promised that ‘the Government will implement what you decide’. Was that sentence worth nothing? Should it have ended ‘as long as it isn’t too difficult’?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ultra-Remainers often argue that Brexit is a special case, a unique act of national self-harm that simply must be reversed at all costs, no matter what the cost to democracy. But this argument is almost comically self-serving. By definition, losers always think the people have chosen badly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If Britain elected Jeremy Corbyn, I might well think it a disastrous mistake that could blight our prospects for generations. But I would look like a fool if I painted my face and marched down Whitehall demanding that the voters be forced to choose again.</p><img id="i-712066382c869ccc" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/22/00/5264674-6301287-image-a-5_1540163115547.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="A second referendum would be a disgraceful betrayal of democracy and an insult to the 17.4 million people who voted in 2016 ¿ and I write that as somebody who voted Remain" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course Brexit is different. Referendums come once in a generation; elections happen every five years. But everybody knew the rules before the campaign began. If the Remainers had won, they would have proclaimed the issue settled forever.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a typical example of their disingenuousness, the People’s Vote campaigners claim that another referendum would heal the divisions of the first campaign. But they surely know this is not true. In fact, dismissing the result of 2016’s heated referendum would likely sow only more division.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The least they could expect would be an explosion of anger from the 17.4 million who voted Leave – as well as millions of Remainers who, like me, think democracy demands that you accept defeat with good grace instead of whining like a spoiled brat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And if they did get a referendum and the result went their way – what then? Wouldn’t that plunge us into greater chaos and uncertainty than ever? Do they seriously think the prospect of ever-closer union under Jean-Claude Juncker such a prize that it is worth alienating great swathes of the country and sacrificing the principle of democracy?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The truth is that another referendum would be a disaster. Nothing would be more likely to drive a deep wedge between the governors and the governed; nothing would be more certain to poison our politics for generations.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>A second referendum would be a disgraceful betrayal of democracy and an insult to the 17.4 million people who voted in 2016 – and I write that as somebody who voted Remain.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Wrestling with your gender identity? Me neither. But those who are unhappy either with the gender they were born into, or with the whole male-female divide, are very much centre stage right now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just last week I was filling in an online form from Mind, the mental health charity, which is working with my 11-year-old daughter’s school on its policies for parents, staff and pupils. Question 3, are you Male or Female, is followed by a third option – Another: please specify.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was tempted to identify as Mermaid, on the basis that this is non-binary, but thought better of it. The fourth question asked: Have you ever identified as transgender, now or in the past? I’ve gone to confession all my life but have never faced anything as intrusive as this.</p><img id="i-e3df7daae5ebbd73" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/21/01/5243604-0-image-a-125_1540082110453.jpg" height="378" width="634" alt="Maria Miller, chairwoman of the women and equalities committee, who recommended passing the Gender Recognition Bill into law, which would allow anyone to identify as a different gender without so much as a doctor’s certificate" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">That’s the thing, though. Questions that never actually occurred to us are now presented as routine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Left to ourselves, without any prompting from activists or officialdom, how many of us, let alone our children, would actually see our gender as an issue?

<p class="mol-para-with-font">I don’t know what the hell’s happened,’ the Cabinet insider said to me. ‘The whole thing’s imploded.’ It has.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Cabinet confidence in May has collapsed. Across Government there was utter incredulity when it emerged a deal had been proposed that would have involved carving out a special status for Northern Ireland – something the Prime Minister has always said she would never entertain, and that her DUP partners have warned would imperil their support for her administration.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘How did they think they would get that past anyone?’ one Minister asked in exasperation. ‘Dominic Raab [the Brexit Minister] had to get on the Eurostar to clear up the mess and tell Barnier to his face it was a non-starter.’</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS debate" data-version="2" id="mol-f5ecc510-d4c9-11e8-a591-0712bdc41551">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Why 36 adds up to doom for Jezza </h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">The key number to watch is 36. That’s how many MPs Labour rebels are aiming to recruit to form a new party – or to at least a breakaway faction.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘That’s the minimum number we’re aiming for,’ a senior plotter tells me. ‘It’s how many we need to replace the SNP as the second-largest opposition.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is important because it would give the leader of the new grouping a guaranteed speaking slot at Prime Minister’s Questions, as well as permitting an injection of public funding or ‘Short Money’. Allies of Jeremy Corbyn believe such a figure is wildly optimistic, but his opponents think that after last month’s Labour conference – in which the party’s rules were amended to make the deselection of sitting MPs easier – a split on this scale is achievable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There’ll be no move before Brexit,’ one rebel explains, ‘but after that all bets are off.’</p></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Two explanations are being floated. One is that negotiations have now been completely hijacked by Olly Robbins, the senior civil servant in charge of the day-to-day talks, and a mandarin regarded with hostility by Brexiteers who believe our man in Brussels is in reality Brussels’ man in Whitehall.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Robbins knew exactly what he was doing,’ said a Minister. ‘It was his plan, and he tried to force it through even though he knew it would be politically toxic.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That Robbins was party to an attempt to effectively bounce the Cabinet into annexing Northern Ireland from the Union is not in dispute. But another member of the Cabinet thinks he is merely being scape-goated for the Prime Minister’s own loss of nerve.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘They’re hanging Robbins out to dry. The problem is May. The Salzburg ambush has changed everything,’ he explained. ‘The EU now think she’s prepared to cave into just about whatever they want in order to get a deal through.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Downing Street had a detailed post-Brexit game plan. But Brussels has steadfastly refused to follow it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No10’s belief was that May would be able to separate the member states from EU negotiators, that the loss of two senior Cabinet Ministers (Boris Johnson and David Davis) over Chequers would demonstrate the PM had gone as far as she could in granting concessions, and that the European panjandrums would respond accordingly. They haven’t. No10 sources insist significant progress has been made on the details of the Chequers settlement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, according to Cabinet insiders, what progress has been made is simply because May is capitulating to the EU’s demands. ‘Before Salzburg the idea was we would meet the EU 50:50. But now it’s more like 70:30 or 80:20,’ said one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some Downing Street officials still cling to the hope of being thrown a threadbare EU lifeline. ‘We’re actually very close now,’ says one. But even one of May’s few remaining Cabinet allies believes this may be wishful thinking.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘A lot of the backlash has come from Ministers who want to be in the Cabinet but like to pretend people will forget they’ve been in the Cabinet when we get to a leadership election.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS debate" data-version="2" id="mol-4b2e54d0-d4ca-11e8-a591-0712bdc41551">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">DD rallies his troops?  </h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nick Wood, former media adviser to Tory leaders William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith, has been spotted in the corridors of Parliament deep in conversation with key members of the David Davis leadership team.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> As well as his extensive list of journalistic contacts, Wood enjoys close links with the party’s Eurosceptic wing. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The DD campaign appears to be stepping up a gear. </p></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But to be honest, even if she does get a deal now, where are the votes for it in the Commons? Is she really going to be able to get Chequers past with Labour votes?’ The consensus among both Tory Brexiteers and Remainers is that she can’t. And that, if anything, opposition to Chequers is now hardening. ‘There are going to be a series of conversations this weekend,’ one Tory grandee told me. ‘People are considering their options.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">None of them are especially palatable. Many backbenchers are hoping the Cabinet revolt can be leveraged into a full-scale challenge to May’s leadership.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Conversely, a number of members of the Cabinet – conscious of the old adage that he who wields the dagger never wears the crown – are now privately hoping the threshold of 48 signatures for a no-confidence vote may at last be reached.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What everyone is agreed on is that if a confidence vote were to be triggered, the events of the past days would make it hard for May to survive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I think there’s a minimum of 100 MPs who wouldn’t back her now,’ says one backbencher, ‘and that’s probably being generous. If she loses that much support then there’s no way she can cling on.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She has clung on before. But that was when it was perceived the PM’s doggedness and determination were the qualities necessary to find a route through the Brexit maze.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now the sense is that – just like that group looking for a new restaurant – she is lost. Her Chequers strategy is in tatters and there is no fall back plan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s cold. It’s raining.

However, the prospect of trolling along on my own was daunting, so I decided to behave as if I were a royal at a cocktail party, moving between groups of people to avoid getting stuck with a bunch of bores.</p><img id="i-f92569ebbe193542" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/21/01/5243240-6299047-Bob_Geldof_knew_exactly_what_the_wear_to_join_protesters_calling-m-78_1540080912675.jpg" height="717" width="634" alt="Bob Geldof knew exactly what the wear to join protesters calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal on the People's Vote march in London" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there was the question of what to wear. Obviously, clothes are not the key question when you are taking part in a demonstration on the future of the country but, for me, clothes are always a question. Demos are an occasion where it is not necessary to suffer for the sake of beauty so, in the end, I stuck on a pair of trainers, green corduroy trousers with big pockets to avoid carrying a bag, and a three-year-old velvet jacket hoping the rain held off.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, I had been photographed in the same outfit for a newspaper article on Ageless Style last year, but I don’t suppose any of my fellow marchers noticed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sadly, I had to leave the march before it finished to rush to the London Film Festival premiere of the biopic A Private War in which Rosamund Pike plays my close friend Marie Colvin, the Sunday Times war reporter who was slaughtered in Homs six years ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Had she still been alive, Marie would have been marching too. But she would also have understood the need to rush off before the end, in time to get home and change into the evening’s party dress and heels.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Men not invited</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">A few nights ago I gave a talk for BroadMinded and Allbright, two new women-only networks. These kind of female members’ clubs are on the rise in many large cities.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The audience was 100 per cent working women in their late 20s and early 30s. They were ambitious and curious but with a great sense of humour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How times change. I compared this group with my friends at that age. I doubt any of us would have considered an all-woman evening, discussing how to make the best of our lives, a night well spent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although in the late 1980s women occupied far fewer senior roles than now – we thought that it was by getting on with the men at work that we were most likely to succeed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It didn’t mean we weren’t close to our female colleagues but after work we were far more likely to be in the pub (or more likely wine bar) forging relationships with guys, both professional and personal.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Instaboasting, the new social menace</h2><img id="i-69ed139b2671d3ab" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/21/00/5242910-0-image-m-52_1540079090244.jpg" height="337" width="306" alt="Prince Andrew was furious that Meghan told the family she was pregnant on Eugenie's wedding day, says Alexandra Shulman " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">By all accounts, Prince Andrew was fit to be tied over Harry and Meghan announcing her pregnancy at his daughter’s wedding.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Totally understandable. We all know how infuriating it is when another member of the family newsbombs your own important event.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instagram has increased the likelihood of this. Instaboasting – posting up the news of an offspring or partner’s triumph on the social media site – means that nowadays, guests will often arrive far more interested in that second’s gossip than they are in one’s own long-planned moment in the spotlight.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Blonde addiction</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Blonde is known as the crack of hair colour in the trade. Once you get a taste for it, you keep wanting more. Lighter and lighter you go until, before you know it, you’re a blonderexic, unable to give up the habit and needing a colourist to manage the perilous withdrawal from peroxide back to the safety of mouse.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Park cafe where you can’t spend cash</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our local park has gone cash- free. Since most of the visitors are under seven years old, it’s rather a sad state of affairs now that they can’t go to the cafe and buy their own sweets and soft drinks. Or perhaps they are all being told to just tap their parents’ credit card. Possibly not the best way to get an early understanding of the value of money.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Milkman delivers</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">This year’s Man Booker Prize was a magnificent occasion, held under the flying buttresses of London’s Guildhall, with guests served honey-laced tarte tatin courtesy of the bees that live on the roof of Fortnum &amp; Mason’s Piccadilly store, and actors Fiona Shaw and Jimmy Nesbitt in attendance. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The winning novel, Milkman, sounds a challenging read. With no character or place names and occasionally very long paragraphs, the author Anna Burns is testing our tolerance to the limit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But for all the criticism of books such as this being too rarefied and unpopular, it’s wonderful that the prize exists and the Man Group supports it. </p><img id="i-fa6bc8200d330cfb" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/21/00/5242932-0-image-m-54_1540079223978.jpg" height="709" width="634" alt="Anna Burns winner of the Man Booker Prize for Fiction for her novel, 'Milkman' poses for pictures following the announcement at the Guildhall in London on October 16" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Culture should be popular but it should also introduce ideas you have never considered.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now that the BBC is employing EastEnders’ Danny Dyer in period dress to front its new history series and our national museums and galleries are under increased pressure to mount mainstream blockbusters to secure Government funding, it’s vital to safeguard the experimental and the difficult. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Otherwise there’ll be nothing left in the land of Shakespeare but wall-to-wall Love Island and pointless diet books.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>I felt compelled to join yesterday’s People’s Vote march in London. I’m well aware of the fact that we’ve already had a People’s Vote – it was called a referendum - but due to the chaos of the Brexit negotiations – and a conviction that the information the country voted on in 2016 is not the same information before us now, I wanted to participate. Obviously, clothes are not the key question when you are taking part in a demonstration on the future of the country but, for me, clothes are always a question.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Alexandra Shulman For The Mail On Sunday</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-21T03:27:30.000+02:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>ALEXANDRA SHULMAN's notebook: What to wear at a demonstration? </mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-21T03:27:30.000+02:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/21/01/5243130-0-image-a-75_1540080897597.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6297681/Thousands-anti-Brexit-campaigners-march-London.html" title="Sadiq Khan tells 'biggest protest since the Iraq War' that 'young people's voices weren't heard' in 2016 and they must get final say on Brexit in new referendum - but leavers brand call a 'losers' vote'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6298059/Celebrities-join-half-million-strong-crowds-demanding-second-referendum.html" title="'Let's be havin' EU': Delia Smith leads luvvie army as Mariella Frostrup, Richard Bacon and Bob Geldof join 'half a million' on 'People's Vote' march demanding second referendum as chef says people 'weren't fully informed' first time"></link></item><item><title>COLONEL TIM COLLINS: How can our chubby, drug-addled and right-on Army protect us from our enemies? </title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6299067/COLONEL-TIM-COLLINS-chubby-drug-addled-right-Army-protect-enemies.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Oct 2018 00:07:04 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6299067</guid><description><![CDATA[COLONEL TIM COLLINS: Today the British military is threadbare, ill-equipped and undermanned.

It can’t recruit soldiers, sailors or airmen. And those who do manage to find their way through the painfully slow recruitment process are often in terrible physical shape.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As The Mail on Sunday reported last week, all three Services face a crisis of fitness and obesity. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An extraordinary 17,602 members of the Army, Navy and Air Force have a body mass index of more than 30, the official measure for obesity. In the Army’s case, it is more than 11 per cent of its personnel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is a disgraceful situation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So will the offenders be drummed out? Have they been given extra physical training to help them get into shape, or even a few choice words to chew over and digest? I very much doubt it – because in today’s world, the Army is a ‘non-judgmental’ and supportive organisation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead of imposing stricter discipline, it has put 96 soldiers on diet pills, while eight have been given liposuction. This lame official response tells you all you need to know: the British Army has been infected with the crippling disease of political correctness. </p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Where once it was a force to be feared and respected, it now prides itself on being liberal, welcoming and all-inclusive. And for this, its senior commanders expect diversity awards, official pats on the back and knighthoods.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At least the secret is now out: our Armed Forces are a shambles.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, I accept that the British Army is constrained by the society it serves, and long has been. Our current predicament has echoes of the recruitment crisis during the second Boer War, when malnutrition was a factor in preventing many willing men joining up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The fact is that today’s young people are overweight and unfit thanks to less active lifestyles and an epidemic of junk food. Rampant drug taking is another feature of modern life contributing both to discipline problems in the Forces and to a serious recruitment crisis.</p><img id="i-ad64c91e24b07bc4" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/06/22/4826896-6248017-image-a-26_1538861217524.jpg" height="438" width="634" alt="Shocking figures expose the Ministry of Defence¿s failure to tackle a crisis in the armed forces (file photo) which military experts say could cost lives in combat" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"> Who but our most bitter enemy would not have winced when this paper revealed earlier this month that soldiers discharged for drugs offences were receiving tens of thousands of pounds as ‘golden hellos’ for rejoining?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was only thanks to the adverse publicity that Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was persuaded to order a quick about-turn and an end to the practice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is not the fault of our Forces that they are chronically undermanned or that recruitment has now been handed over to a private firm, Capita, which has reached record standards of ineffectiveness. A recruitment process that took 90 days now takes 380.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nor can we blame the military for inventing the corrosive political correctness and identity politics that, in wider society, are proving so disruptive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet when the drive to promote gender issues and the celebration of diverse sexuality comes at the expense of military effectiveness – and this is now the case – something has to change and urgently.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">First, the military leadership must shoulder its share of blame for this disastrous situation and take responsibility for its remedy. So far, there has been a whiff of cowardice in the air.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I can reveal that an Army ‘guidance note’ has been circulated which, instead of identifying the problem, attempts to silence its officers. Senior Army figures, the note says, ‘have become aware that serving personnel are not following guidance and have demonstrated negative opinions’ about a series of training videos concerning Muslims, LGBT people, and other ‘sensitive’ individuals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Military superiors, it continues, are ‘increasingly frustrated by the perceived negative impact that serving personnel are having’, warning that anyone who reacts negatively ‘can be dealt with under disciplinary or administrative action as appropriate’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The message is clear: say nothing about the naked emperor. This failure to confront the alarming reality must stop.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Next, we should find a way of returning some degree of autonomy to commanding officers. The traditional response to obesity, for example, would have been more physical training. These days, however, a solicitor’s letter is never far away, particularly when it relates to anything that could be construed as a health matter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">MY UNIT, 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment, used to go on a weekly afternoon run called the Friday Frolic. Anyone under 30 who finished behind me would be summoned to appear in front of me for disciplinary measures an hour later. It is hard to imagine now.</p><img id="i-32ef806a90192399" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/21/00/5023366-6273055-Obese_troops_were_caught_on_camera_at_a_motorway_service_station-a-1_1540078982180.jpg" height="831" width="634" alt="Obese troops were caught on camera at a motorway service station.

The effect is corrosive. In the past, battalions wanted to be the best and the fittest. Now the attitude is: ‘Why bother, if no one else is trying?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some degree of autonomy was also helpful when it came to recruitment. In the face of a system that even then was poor, the Royal Irish did most of their recruiting themselves and delivered a fully manned battalion. Why must they be constrained by Capita?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The stakes are high. We live in a world where British Forces could find themselves in a hot war at short notice – a conflict which the poor physical condition of soldiers, sailors and airmen makes us ill-equipped to win. Our lack of battle-readiness is a danger to the lives of our soldiers and the safety of our country, and it is a matter of grave concern to the parents and families.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This matter will be critical before we know it. We are already under cyber attack and Russia has sent assassins on to our streets to murder British subjects. What next?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I would urge politicians on all sides to shoulder some responsibility, not just for the shameful spread of obesity, but the culture of political correctness that is eating away at morale and efficiency.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sadly, one day soon, British soldiers will witness one of their own under attack. Will they dash forward in support at the risk of their lives? Or will they ‘withdraw in order to co-ordinate the response’, like Sir Craig Mackey, now Deputy Commissioner of Scotland Yard, did while watching the horrific terrorist murder of his colleague and subordinate PC Keith Palmer at the gates of Westminster?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Will our soldiers even take the risk of fighting at all, knowing that any use of lethal force means they could be dragged through the courts many years – even decades – later, with scant protection from their superiors anxious for awards and knighthoods? It is time someone objected to this farce.</p><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Was I affected by the summer heat on that glad confident morning of June 24, 2016? Was it because I’d been up all night, relishing the outcome I had dreamed of but hadn’t expected? Or had that big bottle of celebratory bubbly bought by a friend been, well, a bit too big?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was certainly drunk with excitement when I bumped into Peter Mandelson as he left a TV interview and I arrived for one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aware this former <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/european-union/index.html" id="mol-0ca70850-d4c1-11e8-a421-0712352ce94f">European Union</a> commissioner would be as deflated by <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/brexit/index.html" id="mol-0ca6ba30-d4c1-11e8-a421-0712352ce94f">Brexit</a>’s victory as I was giddily delighted, I searched for something positive to say and made what now seems a crazy suggestion: ‘I know the referendum has gone the wrong way for you but I hope you and other people who understand Brussels can help with the negotiations.’</p><img id="i-bf3081b75d029ab3" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/21/00/5242128-0-image-a-44_1540076960994.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Since the referendum, millions of Leavers and Remainers have stayed apart from each other" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He raised his eyebrow, forced a smile and we parted company.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, my goodness, millions of Leavers and Remainers didn’t just part that day, we’ve stayed apart.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even if the likes of Lord Mandelson, Nick Clegg and John Major had wished to help with the divorce, their knowledge was never sought.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps Theresa May already understood what I didn’t grasp – that no die-hard believer in the EU project could stomach giving any support to a separation they hated so much.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I fear, however, that the primary explanation for Mrs May’s lack of any interest in building a big Brexit tent was revealed recently.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She didn’t even consult her own Brexit and Foreign Secretaries when she formulated her Chequers plan. There are many explanations for the tortuous nature of what we’re all going through, but crippling dysfunction in Downing Street is certainly one of them.</p><img id="i-1662c255135ab731" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/21/00/5241956-0-image-a-59_1540078449179.jpg" height="409" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I can well understand, therefore, what motivated the tens of thousands of people who marched through London yesterday – demanding another referendum and a chance to go back to what we had before our long and ugly national quarrel divided us.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there is no way back. A reversal now would amount to a national humiliation. The world will have watched Britain’s politicians and Government fail to grasp the chance to return to being what most other nations across the globe already are: self-governing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The country that once ran the world’s largest empire would have decided it couldn’t even manage itself. And while Britain would be a shrunken shadow of its former self, you can imagine what Brussels would think of itself.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over many years the EU machine has repeatedly bulldozed over the democratic decisions of member states. Greece’s referendum rejecting the eurozone’s punitive austerity regime didn’t change anything. Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands have each voted against various EU projects in referendums, but none of the votes caused the EU to alter its plans in any significant ways.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But forcing the world’s oldest parliamentary democracy and fifth-largest economy to accept that it can’t survive without Brussels? It would be the biggest ever victory for the belief that has driven the European project from its inception – the idea that nation states and national parliaments should do as Brussels says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You don’t need to be a Leaver to recognise how humiliating such a reversal would be – and Britain wouldn’t be the only democracy that would find itself diminished. Every EU state would note that not-so-Great Britain couldn’t win a negotiation against the Brussels machine.</p><img id="i-78e0ce44b64ab68a" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/21/00/5242126-0-image-a-46_1540077035078.jpg" height="372" width="634" alt="Some have scaremongered about Leave voters rioting if 2016’s result is overturned... this is unlikely, but we'd risk the instant abandonment of trust in British democracy" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The we-know-best cockiness that led its unelected bureaucrats to create the ever-widening eurozone would be back, but on steroids.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An EU army? Continent-wide systems of taxation? The towering dreams of the EU’s Babel builders would get renewed life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their first grab would be for the rebate, won by Mrs Thatcher, that Britain gets from its outsized contribution to the EU budget.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rather than getting billions back for public services such as the NHS, we’d need to find at least £5 billion more for Brussels – on top of what we already give. Terms of membership that 17,410,742 Britons rejected two years ago would be on the slippery slope to getting even worse.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And let’s return to those 17,410,742 Leave voters – a somewhat bigger number than protested yesterday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some have scaremongered about Leave voters rioting if 2016’s result is overturned.</p><img id="i-b9954a4fcd086683" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/21/00/5242118-0-image-a-47_1540077230044.jpg" height="409" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I think widespread disorder would be highly unlikely. Much more possible is something far worse. Rather than a flash of violent protests, we’d risk the instant abandonment of trust in British democracy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It should never be forgotten that many Leave voters hadn’t voted for many years – or ever. They took part in Britain’s largest ever democratic exercise in the hope that voting might actually make a difference.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While, in part, they were motivated by a desire to stem uncontrolled immigration or see more money going to their local hospitals, there was a more general but deeper hunger for a change in direction and national management.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When I talk to other Leave voters I hear of the same kind of exhilaration that I felt on referendum night.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The victory was no ordinary one for us. All the main party leaders had urged the country to vote Remain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The big banks and global financial institutions had done the same – and warned of blood-curdling consequences of doing anything else. Celebrities. Footballers. Archbishops. Remain had almost every big name on its side. It had the biggest cheque book and the machinery of government. But David felled Goliath.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If we end up with Goliath winning, it really would be the worst possible outcome. Leave wouldn’t be the only loser. Leavers, Remainers – the whole country would lose if millions end up turning away from democratic institutions in disgust.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Disdain for ‘the system’ – which is already widespread – would intensify. Leave voters, insofar as they might turn up on Election days ever again, would increasingly be likely to back Trump-like candidates who vow to overturn the system rather than to improve it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the mainstream parties would deserve the contempt. All leading politicians told voters the referendum was a once-in-a-generation event and Parliament would implement what the people decided. While the decision to hold the vote was David Cameron’s, a massive 85 per cent of MPs voted for the parliamentary legislation that made it happen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leave voters aren’t stupid – despite what is often suggested by some Remainers. It would be one thing for a reversal of Brexit to happen if big cheeses such as Tony Blair, John Major, Nick Clegg and their followers had occasionally lifted a finger to try to honour the result.

I think we will import more.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What I want to do is rip up our allegiance to the European Arrest Warrant, a grave breach of our ancient liberties which everyone seems to have completely forgotten about. I want to get rid of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, now our real Supreme Court. And I want to stop rubber-stamping European Commission directives and pretending they are our own laws.

This needs no permission from Brussels. It formally takes us out of the EU, so fulfilling the referendum vote. It would make the Irish border as relaxed as the current frontier between Norway and Sweden, which is pretty relaxed. It frees us from three-quarters of EU interference in our laws and life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It keeps us in the European Economic Area, so there is no risk to the economy. It frees us from the EU’s damaging Common Agricultural Policy and from the daylight robbery of the Common Fisheries Policy. It hugely cuts our contributions to Brussels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, thanks to strident, inflexible groups of MPs whose main concern is their future careers, it has barely been considered.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I can’t stop them.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Even the most charitable verdict on last week’s <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/brexit/index.html" id="mol-fba42630-d4b8-11e8-a8f8-bb31ed8048b0">Brexit</a> talks in Brussels can hardly describe them as a success.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The outcome has managed to anger not just Leavers but ardent Remainers as well.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why? Because the Prime Minister appeared to tacitly endorse the idea of extending the Brexit implementation period beyond December 2020. That, in effect, would delay Brexit by another year for no apparent gain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There would remain a Northern Irish backstop undermining the integrity of the UK, we would have to pay billions more, and there will be no agreement on our future relationship with the EU.</p><img id="i-56703233921cd32e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/20/23/5241306-0-image-a-15_1540074891656.jpg" height="433" width="634" alt="Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves after a news conference at the European Union leaders summit in Brussels" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">This will severely challenge the Prime Minister’s statement at the Conservative Conference that austerity has ended.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The consequences of the extra costs on next week’s Budget and the nation’s finances would be immense and entirely unnecessary.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Two years ago, the British people voted to take back control and leave the EU. Any final deal must respect what people voted for: control of borders, control of laws, control of money, control of trade. All free of oversight from EU institutions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The EU is not entitled to split up the UK. And the EU is not entitled to direct how we regulate our economy and govern ourselves after we leave. We should not allow ourselves to be bullied by the EU. Now is the time to stand up for the national interest and plot a better course.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite the flawed strategy to date, it is still possible to reset our path towards a proper free trade agreement. But we are running out of time, and we should not fear a ‘no deal’ outcome.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Given the EU’s continued intransigence, we should now step up such preparations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The paradox is that the more we do, the less likely it becomes. Because if we do, the EU will strike a deal. We have many cards in our favour and the EU knows it. So do the nation states and their industrial leaders. The chief economist of Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest bank, has said that outside the EU ‘the UK will do just as well or better…’ – not least because outside the eurozone, we have ‘flexible exchange rates’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the event of no deal, our currency would adjust, making EU goods such as German cars about one third more expensive than before 2016 – leading to a drop of German car sales to the UK of about a third.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Do we really think German industry is unaware of this? We should be accelerating already planned action to improve our ports, logistics and transport to ensure UK ports can cope with delays if any EU ports become deliberately difficult about handling freight coming to or from Britain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The UK also should be taking world-class legal advice now. We already know that any aggressive threats of discrimination against our goods and services would be illegal under World Trade Organisation rules (and indeed Article 8 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty!)</p><img id="i-7c3a56c4a7b8c298" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/20/23/5241584-0-image-a-16_1540075016720.jpg" height="448" width="634" alt="Northern Ireland's DUP leader, Arlene Foster. There would remain a Northern Irish backstop undermining the integrity of the UK" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">There have been claims that planes will not fly between the UK and EU. This is extremely improbable as it would undermine the Spanish and other European tourism markets as well as Mediterranean property markets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Furthermore, European flights would still need our airspace in order to fly to the USA. That should be enough to focus minds on a sensible outcome. Also, the Chicago Convention on international civil aviation will still exist and need to be applied and they are hardly going to flout that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many of these ‘threats’ are Project Fear Mk 2 when it has become patently clear that Project Fear Mk 1 was demonstrably incorrect.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, of course, there are many countries outside the EU waiting to make free trade deals with us.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Neither should we forget that, in the event of no deal, there are forces we can unleash to kick-start our economy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">British companies have cash reserves of £613 billion. Investment of just three per cent of that is equivalent to £18 billion, or one per cent of GDP. Getting UK companies to spend this in the next two years while Brexit takes effect would help provide a sharp increase in British growth, productivity, employment and wage levels. This would encourage UK companies to invest here rather than elsewhere.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So there is a strong case for increased investment tax incentives for the first two years after Brexit Day to encourage UK businesses to invest in Britain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are other taxation measures we can take to stimulate the economy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Annual Investment Allowance – which helps firms pay less tax when they buy assets – should be increased from the current £200,000 to £1 million to encourage greater investment in small and medium-sized businesses.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, a wider, time-limited system of first-year allowances for larger investments should be considered and targeted on particular sectors in line with the Government’s industrial strategy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A brighter future needs smart regulation, not deregulation, and global standards, not EU standards, to make us more competitive. Any problems will be short-term. We should not be deterred from transforming the UK into a global trading power.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Government is in serious danger of treating Brexit as a problem to be minimised when, properly handled, it is a golden opportunity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is time for our Government to seize the moment and forge a fundamental transformation of our economy and our potential for future generations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Even the most charitable verdict on last week’s Brexit talks in Brussels can hardly describe them as a success. The outcome has managed to anger not just Leavers but ardent Remainers as well. Why? Because the Prime Minister appeared to tacitly endorse the idea of extending the Brexit implementation period beyond December 2020. That, in effect, would delay Brexit by another year for no apparent gain.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>David Davis For The Mail On Sunday</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-21T02:18:17.000+02:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>DAVID DAVIS: We're throwing away a golden opportunity  </mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-21T02:18:17.000+02:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/20/23/5241306-0-image-a-19_1540075140185.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1208231</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>REUTERS</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6297681/Thousands-anti-Brexit-campaigners-march-London.html" title="Sadiq Khan tells 'biggest protest since the Iraq War' that 'young people's voices weren't heard' in 2016 and they must get final say on Brexit in new referendum - but leavers brand call a 'losers' vote'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6297525/Hate-preacher-Anjem-Choudary-set-launch-court-action-against-strict-conditions-release.html" title="Hate preacher Anjem Choudary set to launch court action against 'strict' conditions of his release that he claims breach his human rights - and he could get legal aid to do it "></link></item><item><title>No wonder they call him Little Saddam: MICHAEL BURLEIGH says Saudi Arabia's Mohammed Bin Salman is an unstable despot whose bloodlust threatens the entire Middle East</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6298711/No-wonder-call-Little-Saddam-MICHAEL-BURLEIGH-Saudi-Crown-Prince.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Oct 2018 21:47:04 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6298711</guid><description><![CDATA[The Turkish investigations cannot explain the reckless brutality of a murder which was clearly ordered from the top by the Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman (pictured).]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Why else would a Saudi consular vehicle head in that direction, wrenching out and discarding its satellite tracking equipment on the way?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet none of this can explain the reckless brutality of a murder which, as John Sawers, the former head of MI6, has said, was clearly ordered from the top by the Crown Prince and de facto leader of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed Bin Salman.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The diplomatic and reputational consequences have been hugely damaging for the Kingdom.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first explanation is that Mr Khashoggi was seen as a particular threat. Not only was he an exceptionally well-informed insider, a member of the Riyadh establishment – he had been an adviser to the Saudi security services – but he was a vocal critic of the current regime through his regular column in the Washington Post.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Significantly, Mr Khashoggi was a patron of a new online platform called the Bee Army, an encrypted messaging system for dissidents both outside and inside the Kingdom, with a particular space for Saudis to post their grievances about corruption.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was the Bee Army that probably proved fatal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Saudi Arabians are the largest internet users in the Middle East, but the government there has nothing like the Chinese Great Firewall to filter out undesirable influences. It uses more draconian means.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More disturbing, still, however, is the growing evidence that the 33-year-old Crown Prince, who presents himself as a reformer, is fast becoming an irrational, unstable despot to rival the late Saddam Hussein.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Worried Kuwaitis already call him ‘little Saddam’, fearing that he, too, has plans to invade their vulnerable emirate.</p><img id="i-39427f17a0d97681" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/20/22/5240308-0-image-a-63_1540071561038.jpg" height="435" width="634" alt="Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman on his way to meet PM Theresa May at 10 Downing Street on the first day of his three-day visit to the UK in March this year " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">As early as December 2015, the BND, the German equivalent of MI6, took the highly unusual step of releasing a report about generational change in the Saudi leadership. It warned that power was being concentrated in the hands of Bin Salman, then the defence minister and Deputy Crown Prince. It also predicted he would attempt to succeed his father as king, and that he would use that platform to become a Saddam-style leader of the Arab world.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a result, the Saudis, who have often been seen as a valuable pro-Western ally, would abandon past caution in favour of a destabilising regional role. Worse, the BND feared he was a gambler who would use military might to get his way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was an odd statement for an intelligence service to release, particularly given the strong commercial relationship between the two countries (Germany, like Britain, sells arms to Saudi Arabia). Unless, that is, the agency had access to clear and worrying evidence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have been told by a member of another Gulf ruling house that the BND got its hands on Bin Salman’s medical history after he was treated for epilepsy in Germany as a teenager – including psychiatric records that have led to such concern about his state of mind.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The BND was right about Bin Salman’s ambitions. With his 82-year-old father King Salman, suffering from Alzheimer’s, Bin Salman took over as Crown Prince last year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, it seems, the Germans are being proved right about his stability. Under Bin Salman, the Saudis’ ongoing war in Yemen has been conducted without any regard for the 10,000 civilian casualties or the risk of 11 million people starving to death.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In November last year, he detained the Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri, who is a Saudi dual national, in Riyadh to force him to resign in revenge for not containing the rising influence of Iranian-backed Hezbollah.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The same month, Bin Salman organised the notorious ‘sheikhdown’ in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton Hotel. Some 150 members of Saudi Arabia’s political and business elite were invited to a major international investors conference at the palatial hotel, then held there by armed guards until they agreed to pay $100 billion dollars Bin Salman says the country was owed. Sundry Saudi billionaires were abused and in some cases tortured. At least one army general died of a broken neck, while several reformers (former economics or finance ministers) have completely disappeared.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Every rival to Bin Salman has been purged, notably the previous Crown Prince, his cousin Mohammed Bin Nayef, who had strong Western security links.</p><img id="i-a8cb74c6476c0083" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/20/22/5240310-6298711-image-m-62_1540071361403.jpg" height="386" width="634" alt="Numan Kurtulmus (pictured) of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party said that Istanbul would share its evidence of Khashoggi's killing with the world" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bin Salman has been hoping to prompt Donald Trump to wage a potentially catastrophic war against Iran, something the Israelis and Saudis want to bring about.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And he has come close to invading Qatar because of its global pretensions, settling instead for an economic blockade.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Saudis are planning to separate Qatar physically from Saudi Arabia by spending $700 million on a huge canal, leaving just enough room for a toxic nuclear waste dump on the border.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The regional Gulf Co-operation Council alliance lies in ruins, with Bahrain, the Emirates and Saudi Arabia on one side, and Kuwait, Oman and Qatar on the other.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All of this brings us back to Mr Khashoggi, who opposed the isolation of Qatar and challenged the entire notion of the new Crown Prince as a reformer, notably by questioning the economic basis of his reform programme.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Critics of the Saudi regime say he was vindicated after the part-privatisation of the vast state oil concern Saudi Aramco, championed by Bin Salman, was abandoned this summer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All eyes are on Washington, where President Trump finally seems to accept that Mr Khashoggi has been murdered. (His own security services will hold intercepts of numerous calls from the killers in Ankara to Riyadh, likely to be damning.)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">America does not have to worry about the Saudis ramping up oil prices since, thanks to the fracking boom, the US is the world’s biggest oil producer. So we can expect to see the murder team put on Specially Designated Nationals lists – blocking their assets and banning them from the US – while informal pressure will be applied on King Salman to clip his son’s wings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Crown Prince, meanwhile, will try to blame rogue subordinates. Five officials have reportedly been fired, and 18 people arrested. A major general called Assiri is being lined up as the chief fall-guy, though his sinister head of personal security Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb was also photographed in Istanbul at the time of the killing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Normally there is no problem that Saudi Arabia can’t buy itself out of. This is different. A consulate has been used to commit murder. At a minimum the West, including Britain, should expel all Saudi military attaches and spies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">King Salman should know that his son, Mohammed the Murderer, is now tainted in the eyes of the world and reconsider the succession to the throne.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for Britain, although our weapons sales to Saudi Arabia are hugely profitable, they make up only one per cent of our export total.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We should not be fawning to the House of Saud.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our MPs should not be on their payroll, rubbing their hands like a set of Mayfair car dealers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We must not allow customers for our armaments to get British foreign policy thrown in for free.</p><div class="item">

Yes, she is under fire from all sides. Yes, she has made mistakes. Yes, she is in a political pickle. Yes, the Government might yet fall.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the massive problems she faces make cracking the Enigma code look easy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her difficulty is easy enough to identify: she is conducting two sets of negotiations at once. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the one hand, her Brexit chief Dominic Raab — a considerable improvement on his overhyped predecessor David Davis — has to strike a deal in the national interest with Brussels.</p><img id="i-f4d74b8967bc0ce1" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/20/01/5219524-0-image-a-97_1539995527117.jpg" height="484" width="634" alt="British Prime Minister Theresa May (L) and European Council President Donald Tusk (R) during  the Asem 12, Asia-Europe Meeting in Brussels, Belgium" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the other hand, she has to negotiate with mutinous Conservative MPs — some of whom think she is being too hostile to Brussels, and some too friendly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In this game of multi-dimensional chess, she faces four conflicting negotiating objectives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">First, Mrs May, who is at heart a patriot, is determined to avoid the chaos and economic distress which would inevitably flow from a no-deal Brexit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Second, she is utterly determined to avoid the break-up of the United Kingdom, an outcome that is very much on the cards, if the wrong Brexit deal is struck.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Third, she needs to retain the support of the ragged group of Democratic Unionist MPs who are vital if the Conservatives are to maintain a majority in Westminster.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And fourth, she must avert the danger of a General Election followed by the very likely election of Prime Minister Corbyn.</p><div class="item">

Any fair-minded observer must surely acknowledge that she deserves enormous credit for steadfastness and courage under savage attack.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is why it is so important to ignore the headlines and look at the underlying realities. These are rather more encouraging than many realise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Behind the political histrionics, hundreds of civil servants are quietly working towards a deal. Even ice-cold EU negotiator Michel Barnier said yesterday that we are 90 per cent of the way there. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Crucially, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the most important voice in Europe, is making encouraging noises.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And let’s further remember there’s precious little new about any of this. Every deal ever struck with Europe has gone down to the 11th hour and often beyond. There is no reason Brexit will be an exception.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nevertheless, the Prime Minister is approaching a moment of terrible danger. She faces a nightmare three months, starting with the Budget in nine days’ time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jacob Rees-Mogg’s Brexiteers threaten to cause trouble with Chancellor Philip Hammond’s financial statement.</p><div class="item">

Mr Hammond will be forced into extra revenue-raising measures to pay for the Prime Minister’s concession of an extended negotiating period.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brexiteers say they would be justified in voting against the Budget because it would not be necessary to find these additional funds if Mrs May sticks to her original plan of the transition period ending on December 31, 2020.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Frankly, the PM may not be able to survive if she can’t carry her Budget in the Commons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For an old hand like me, the situation today is hauntingly similar to the problems faced by the John Major government in the mid-Nineties, when Maastricht Treaty rebels voted against Chancellor Ken Clarke’s plans to raise VAT on fuel. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then, too, the Tory government was humiliatingly dependent on the votes of Ulster Unionists.

It now looks likely that no deal will be decided until December, or even as late as January next year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May must then take her deal back to the House of Commons. This will be the most potentially dangerous moment of all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Will the DUP really vote against the Government, as it is threatening to do? They must know that could spark a General Election which might lead to John McDonnell — who said this week he longs for a united Ireland — marching into Number 11 Downing Street.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Are the hard Brexiteers really able to muster the support they need to sabotage Mrs May? And how many Labour rebels can be induced to vote with the Conservative Government?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May has to confront fresh talk of Cabinet resignations, and warnings that Tory rebels have mustered the necessary 48 letters to spark a Tory leadership contest. Yet I cannot see the point of bringing down the Prime Minister.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whoever took over from Mrs May would face exactly the same problems.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Boris Johnson might change direction and force through a hard Brexit, but could not command a majority in the Commons when it came to a vote.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I accept the Prime Minister has made mistakes. She was too quick to exercise Article 50, committing Britain to leave the European Union on March 29 next year. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Negotiations have proved much more difficult and complex than she predicted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Prime Minister was also unwise to cave in to European pressure to agree the so-called Northern Irish backstop. Neither has she consulted enough with senior Cabinet colleagues.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet, for all that, she deserves respect. The most likely outcome remains that Mrs May will still be Prime Minister next April, having led Britain out of the European Union. And that will have been a remarkable achievement.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Nick Clegg was deputy prime minister for five years.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Might it happen again? History tells us that whenever Europe tries to act in unison, it screws up. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne left an empire that collapsed into ruins.

The other is the attempt of one power after another to seek to dominate and unite those disparate tribes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rome tried. So did successive popes, Holy Roman emperors, Louis XIV, Napoleon, Hitler and now, dare I add, the leaders of the European Union. Some of these attempts were well-intentioned; most were not so.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no question they together forged a continent that is globally outstanding.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today, Europe is wealthy, stable, mostly liberal and a magnet to the world’s migrants, rich and poor alike. Whether this was because of or in spite of a history of ceaseless conflict is an open question. But so, too, is whether half a century of stability can survive any new breakdown in unity.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">When I first studied Europe’s history, I searched for themes that have glued together its various forces. First was the potency of ancient Mediterranean culture. Greece under Pericles was a kingdom of reason, fascinated by the human condition as expressed in art, literature and civic politics. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rome was a sort of opposite, a realm of law and order, the wielding of power over the entire Mediterranean basin. ‘These be your arts, O Rome,’ said Virgil, ‘to impose the ways of peace.’ The operative word was impose.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As Roman rule disintegrated, it mutated into that of the Christian church.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Christianity was ostensibly a doctrine of universal love and peace, but it soon became a cauldron of rivalry and disunity. It split Rome from Constantinople, and proved so quarrelsome that a third of Christendom — in the Levant and Africa — became Muslim and has remained so ever since.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 1216, the bid of Pope Innocent III to declare himself sovereign lord of Europe bred endless conflict with the Holy Roman Empire, based in Germany.</p><img id="i-19bcedb72592ba06" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/19/23/5217432-6296651-image-a-11_1539988259128.jpg" height="428" width="634" alt="A ruined Berlin in 1945. The collapse of a united Europe did neither tyrant any good, but it did turn Germany from a peaceful confederacy — a kind of giant Switzerland — into a belligerent power under the supremacy of warlike Prussia" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">So we can conclude that as a glue of union, religion was a failure. By the 16th century, the Reformation had split Innocent’s Roman church in two, between Protestant north and Catholic south.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This, in turn, led to the Thirty Years War — the cruellest devastation of Europe before the 20th century. From the wreckage of that first great European war arose ever more potent nation states — notably France, Spain and Austria.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new cause of disruption was not religion but dynasty. Louis XIV sought perpetual war with his neighbours. Russia flexed its territorial muscles. Frederick the Great of Prussia declared that ‘national enlargement is a fundamental law of life’. To him, Europe was synonymous with struggle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nothing seemed able to bring peace to the continent: not the vitality of the Renaissance or wisdom of the Enlightenment, not great thinkers and writers like Petrarch, Shakespeare, Locke, Voltaire or Goethe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Napoleon’s attempt to unite Europe under French rule led to five million deaths. The victorious nations at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, a few months after Waterloo, valiantly attempted a ‘Concert of Europe’. In future, they ordained, differences would be settled around a conference table not a battlefield.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Peace lasted for half a century, while Europe plunged into a different form of aggrandisement — that of overseas imperialism.</p><img id="i-440d4f59835f6923" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/20/02/5220270-6296651-President_of_the_European_Commission_Jean_Claude_Juncker_L_and_E-a-23_1539999928426.jpg" height="508" width="634" alt="President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (L) and European Council President Donald Tusk (R) in Brussels this week" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">By the end of the 19th century, the British, French, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish and Germans ruled an astonishing half of the world’s population, and 85 per cent of its trade.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some might have hoped that such expansion might leave Europe itself at last in peace. Yet no sooner had it strutted the globe as a champion of progress, than it fell victim to two of the world’s most horrendous conflagrations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The idea that the ‘Kaiser’s war’ and then ‘Hitler’s war’ were random Prussian monstrosities was absurd. They resulted from a failure of political imagination and leadership across all of Europe, whose turbulent nations seemed incurably belligerent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By 1945, Europe was in self-inflicted ruins. Its peoples were starving, its cities destroyed and a centuries-old edifice of cultural achievement was crippled. Though Fascism had been defeated, the price was half a continent enslaved to Communism, and the other half dependent on American protection.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no doubt that the subsequent half-century saw Europe at its best. It rebuilt itself, displaying a sincere desire for there never to be a war ever again. Economics and trade should be the new glue of union.</p><img id="i-1387307d9e89ecc3" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/20/01/5219566-6296651-image-a-41_1539995538991.jpg" height="500" width="634" alt="Churchill pictured with American President Roosevelt at the Yalta Conference, which decided how Germany- and Europe, should be split after the war" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">A Common Market was formed in 1956 under the Treaty of Rome. This treaty grew and flourished, until a free trade area covered virtually all non-communist Europe. The continent seemed genuinely at peace, under the embrace of ‘ever-closer union’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But as this half of Europe prospered and cohered, it also slid into the morass of bureaucratic centralism. And here is where the lessons of history were ignored.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ambition of the Brussels elite was curiously reminiscent of the medieval church. It became a quest for ever-tighter control of its adherents, and a disregard for the political mood of member states.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first moment of truth came with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. This ended the wartime division of Europe, to which the EU reacted like a conquering power. It enticed Russia’s old Warsaw Pact allies into the EU and NATO, and left Moscow dangerously isolated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Boris Yeltsin warned that advancing NATO deep into Eastern Europe meant ‘the flames of war could break out again across Europe’, the EU laughed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The result was Vladimir Putin, vowing to ‘make Russia great again’ under his kleptomaniac rule. In the U.S., the balance of power between a central superstate and its various subordinate states was embedded in a constitution, written in blood. In Europe, that balance was left to evolve.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The EU ignored the risks it was running, not just in mishandling Russia but in readily opening its borders to the immature democracies of Eastern Europe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After Maastricht in 1992, which effectively pledged the continent to become one giant federal entity, majority voting in the EU council eroded the authority of national parliaments. Europe seemed the plaything of French bureaucrats and German bankers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once more, the hard-learned lessons of the past were disregarded in the zealous pursuit of a new Nirvana. For example, the continent’s longest confederation was the Holy Roman Empire. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Voltaire may have called it not holy, nor Roman nor an empire — but its respect for the treasured autonomy of dozens of German princelings contrived to keep the German peoples at peace with their neighbours for a millennium. </p><img id="i-38692918deea3945" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/20/02/5219564-6296651-Soviet_soldiers_march_through_the_Red_Square_Moscow_on_the_May_D-a-14_1539998627643.jpg" height="409" width="634" alt="Soviet soldiers march through the Red Square, Moscow, on the May Day parade.

That union collapsed only when Napoleon in France and then Bismarck in Germany could not tolerate what they saw as affront to their imperial ambitions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The collapse of a united Europe did neither tyrant any good, but it did turn Germany from a peaceful confederacy — a kind of giant Switzerland — into a belligerent power under the supremacy of warlike Prussia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The lessons must be obvious. Attempts at European union fail when they lose respect for the identity and autonomy of the continent’s ancestral communities.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You cannot ram union, let alone globalisation, down people’s throats. Diversity lies at the core of Europe’s collective experience, but it is a jealously guarded diversity.</p><img id="i-8f9a60cb7301c930" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/20/01/5219706-6296651-image-a-43_1539995885979.jpg" height="426" width="634" alt="When Russian president Boris Yeltsin warned that advancing NATO deep into Eastern Europe meant ‘the flames of war could break out again across Europe’, the EU laughed" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Europe can never be subsumed under a single power structure. Union can only be light-touch and consensual.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The EU’s greatest mistake was to move beyond ever-closer trade to an ill-defined ‘ever closer union’. Above all, it lay in demanding that member states accept open borders.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That may have seemed a small matter to the globe-trotting cosmopolites of Brussels. But control over immigration meant control over the character and rate of change of local communities.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To the member states of Europe, this was a critical area of sovereignty. The character of one’s society is not to be bartered merely for tariff-free trade.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unlike previous unions in Europe, the EU is a collection of self-determining democracies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Already by 2010, anti-European sentiment was growing and consent crumbling. Turnouts in EU elections plummeted from 60 per cent to 40 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Populist politicians — anti-immigration and often anti-EU — emerged in the UK, France, Italy, Germany and former communist states. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 2008 financial crisis saw the Eurozone’s German masters inflict terrible damage on Greece and Spain.</p><img id="i-1ddc14d46f281d54" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/20/01/5219704-0-image-a-47_1539995971061.jpg" height="426" width="634" alt="There was nothing new in Britain detaching itself from the rest of Europe.

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Then, in 2016, the UK shattered the equilibrium. Its people voted — narrowly — to withdraw. Europe’s union faced a fissure, and a deep one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was nothing new in Britain detaching itself from the rest of Europe. It had ‘left’ after the Hundred Years War that finally ended in the mid-15th century, and after Henry VIII’s defection from Rome nearly a century later. It refused to join the Common Market in 1957, and only combined under NATO to benefit from America’s nuclear shield.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, once again, Britain has said enough is enough.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We should have no doubt of the reason. Political Europe has not found an answer to the question that defied all earlier attempts at union. How can this fragmentary continent be united without lurching either towards debilitating central authority or towards disintegration?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since the Lisbon Treaty of 2009, the EU has lurched towards the former. Now, with the rise of a reactionary populism, it is lurching towards the latter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is hardly a member state that would dare imitate Britain, and hold a referendum on EU membership. But that is insufficient consent for union.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With or without Britain, the EU must find a way of returning substantive sovereignty to its member states, not least over their borders. If it does that, who knows, Britain might rejoin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If it fails, Britain will not be the only defector. The EU will go the way of its many forerunners — to disintegration and danger.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>A Short History of Europe: From Pericles to Putin by Simon Jenkins, Viking, £25.

And what about Clegg’s British political allies, who may be feeling distinctly sore at his Yankee volte-face?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Former deputy prime ministers used to retire to the Lords (Howe, Prescott, Whitelaw), an Oxbridge Mastership (Rab Butler), writing (Herbert Morrison), or to their Oxfordshire arboretum to snap twigs and gnash teeth in bitter regret (Heseltine).

Now he is going to be top lobbyist for a firm so deaf to decency that when British police investigating a schoolgirl’s murder asked to look at a suspect’s Facebook activity, they were given no help. The company says it was restricted from doing so under US law.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clegg, as an MP, wanted oppressive regulatory checks on newspapers. His new employer is a direct competitor of those newspapers. But Facebook is markedly less responsible about its editorial content than even the most vulgar of our red-tops. No British newspaper has been used by jihadis to publish recruitment content. Facebook has. Clegg used to style himself a democrat. How does that square with claims that Facebook has been used by the Kremlin to help rig elections in Europe and America? As for Facebook’s tax-avoidance record (all of it completely legal, we are assured), just think how many students’ fees – the fees Clegg introduced, after saying he wouldn’t – could have been subsidised by the Government if social media firms had only coughed up more in corporate duties.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg looks like a laid-back California dude, but he is a ruthless billionaire whose business swaggers round the world, treating national governments like pawns. Zuckerberg is one of those Silicon Valley smoothies whose image fooled the Cameron/Clegg/Osborne government. Don’t let’s deter the Ubers and Facebooks and Googles by pursuing them with big tax bills, went the word.</p><img id="i-fc2e2169940d3c9e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/19/15/5202136-6294701-image-m-24_1539958486978.jpg" height="1051" width="634" alt="Sir Nick and his Spanish wife Miriam will be heading to Silicon Valley in the coming months with their three children" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-f4025c3a604226b9" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/19/15/5203632-6294701-image-a-29_1539960129974.jpg" height="959" width="634" alt="Sir Nick released a long statement explaining why he was moving to Facebook and the 'wrench' of quitting the second referendum campaign" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clegg, as a member of the ‘quad’ which ran the Coalition, was right in the cockpit when social media giants were cut all that slack. Now, kerching-kerching, Clegg is off to join them. In California, his feistily Iberian wife will not want for domestic help. She and Nick will be joining the seriously rich.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What are Lib Dem members to make of this Californian flit? Many of the party’s rank and file are decent, civic-minded folk who care deeply about standards in public and corporate life. Many of them will have volunteered for the party for years, knocking on doors to argue for localism and accountability. Now their hero Clegg is off to stuff his pockets with glib, amoral Facebook.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A word of advice to Mr Zuckerberg: watch your back. Sir Nick has form for duplicity. As well as that appalling U-turn on college fees (which saw the Lib Dems massacred at the 2015 election), there was also his churlish refusal to agree to parliamentary boundary changes, another issue the Lib Dems had long supported because it would make constituencies more equal in size.</p><img id="i-504237257ecdbb9c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/20/01/5219300-0-image-a-38_1539994888400.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Nick Clegg, centre, pictured with Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-9165509adf4836b7" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/19/15/5202138-6294701-image-a-28_1539959994304.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Mark Zuckerberg is said to have pursued the former MP for months as he battles scandals in the US and EU" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clegg changed his mind in a bad-tempered pique because some Tory backbench MPs had opposed his House of Lords reforms. Oh yes, and he once enthused about giving the British people a vote on Europe. When it happened, and his pro-EU side lost, he was furious.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ever since, he has been saying he did not want Britain to become globalised and Americanised – even while he was in discussions to join Facebook.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So farewell to the cocky, calculating Clegg, booted out of Parliament by the voters last time around, and now taking a running jump into a swimming pool full of dollar bills. Brexit Britain will be the better without him.</p><div class="item">

Yesterday’s news of his move to America to become head of global affairs for Facebook was almost comical in its ripeness. Gleaming Mr Liberalism is off to earn a greenback fortune with one of the most cynical forces in capitalism. After initial laughter at the caricature greediness, two immediate thoughts: is Facebook really sure it wants to be represented by such a slippery hypocrite? And what about Clegg’s British political allies, who may be feeling distinctly sore at his Yankee volte-face? Facebook has hired him for his EU contacts – he was once a Brussels official and an MEP.

They responded by battering and stabbing him to death.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His father Cecil — one of the Windrush generation — had reported the drug dealers to the police before but ‘they did nothing’. He was too frightened to confront them himself as he was ‘scared they’d kill me’. How poignant those words now sound.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet this is daily life for folk such as Ian Tomlin on the Battersea council estate in South <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-3369b740-d3f3-11e8-afd7-8bacbe999bfd">London</a> where he lived. Yes Battersea, less than four miles from the Houses of Parliament.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ian was a driver for the council and a devoted dad. The news of his death came as Home Secretary Sajid Javid announced plans to expand ‘hate crime’ to include acts of misogyny, contempt towards elderly people and even misandry — hatred of men. Met Police Superintendent Waheed Khan confirmed it might even be extended to cover groups such as redheads, goths and punks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is madness. Last year police forces — despite being desperately short of resources — investigated no fewer than 94,000 ‘hate crimes’, wasting precious hours on what in many cases amounted to nothing more than grievances. Sergeant Richard Cooke, chairman of the West Midlands Police Federation, has said forces are expected to record and follow up hate crime reports even when no criminal offence has taken place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the meantime, callous, savage crimes of the kind that killed Ian Tomlin go unchecked.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Javid and London Mayor Sadiq Khan — who is responsible for crime and policing in the capital — have played up their ‘humble’ origins as sons of immigrants.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet the people who suffer most from prioritising hate crime at the expense of street crime are those of similarly poor ethnic backgrounds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The cold fact is that killings in this country are at a ten-year high. Ian was the 113th murder victim in London so far this year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, I’m not saying police should ignore genuine crimes caused by intolerance and prejudice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But how can it be right that police have to chase up a wolf whistle or an insensitive comment about ginger hair when genuine hate crimes are committed daily by drug gangs and serial criminals with impunity?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And a loving father loses his life as a result.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong> Reality TV starlet and beautician Scarlett Harrison, 20, claimed she couldn’t blow into a breathalyser after being stopped for drink-driving as her enhanced trout pout lips were too fat.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Until I read his obituaries this week, after his death at the age of 88, I confess that the name Walter Mischel meant nothing to me — although his nickname ‘the Marshmallow Man’ rang the faintest of bells.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was only when I read on that it began to come back to me, and I realised that he was the American psychology professor who inspired one of the most interesting debates of our time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For Mischel was the Vienna-born refugee from Hitler who devised the famous ‘marshmallow test’, which divided humanity into two categories: those of us who can’t resist instant rewards, and those who have the willpower to delay gratification in the expectation of gaining greater benefits later.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To remind readers with memories as rusty as mine, his experiment — launched at Stanford University, <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-bf633140-d330-11e8-99a1-cfb118ceaeae">California</a>, in the Sixties — involved putting terrible temptation in the way of 653 children aged three to five.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In front of each boy and girl his researchers placed a marshmallow, telling them that if they waited 20 minutes before eating it, they would be given an extra one. But that wouldn’t happen if they gobbled theirs up straight away.</p><img id="i-2f08eb6ce550270a" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/19/00/5183634-6292863-image-m-12_1539906368325.jpg" height="550" width="634" alt="Walter Mischel designed the 'marshmallow test' which was test on children and rose to prominence during the 1960s" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">Distract</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The assistants then left the children on their own, while Professor Mischel watched them from behind a one-way mirror, studying their agonies as they battled to resist temptation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In these more sensitive times, the experiment would probably be condemned as child cruelty. But callous soul that I am, I found the professor’s observations hilarious.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some of the children covered their eyes so that they couldn’t see the marshmallow. Others stuck their fingers in their ears or tried to distract themselves by singing or arguing aloud the case for waiting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of one boy, Mischel wrote: ‘Enrico tipped his chair far back against the wall, banging it non-stop while staring up at the ceiling with a bored, resigned look, breathing hard, seemingly enjoying the large crashing sounds he was making.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The long and the short of it was that most of the professor’s young guinea pigs couldn’t bear to wait for the full 20 minutes. A few tucked into their marshmallows immediately, while the average length of time his subjects managed to hold out was less than three minutes. Only some 30 per cent stayed the course, resisting their marshmallows until the researchers returned with a second one for each of them.</p><img id="i-7506c0949edd4a21" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/19/00/5183628-6292863-image-a-8_1539906341923.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="In front of each boy and girl his researchers placed a marshmallow, telling them that if they waited 20 minutes before eating it, they would be given an extra one" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘In one dramatically successful self-distraction technique,’ reported the professor, ‘after experiencing much agitation, a little girl rested her head, sat limply, relaxed herself, and proceeded to fall sound asleep.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what made the experiment so fascinating was a follow-up study decades later. From this, it emerged that those who had been best able to delay gratification in their childhood tended to be the most successful in life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those who had eaten their marshmallows immediately, on the other hand, were more prone to obesity, alcohol dependency, poor exam results, drug addiction and a host of other problems.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All I can say is that if Professor Mischel had tested me in my toddlerhood, I’m quite sure I would have been among the very first to tuck in to my marshmallow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At every stage of my life, I’ve been a firm believer in the old saying that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. And like Oscar Wilde’s Lord Darlington, in Lady Windermere’s Fan: ‘I can resist everything except temptation.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mind you, I’m a little more patient than a colleague in the office, who confides that she can’t watch the first episode of a thriller series on TV without looking up the plot on the internet to discover what happens at the end. She tells me she’ll even skip to the last page of a book, after reading the first chapter, because she can’t wait to find out whodunit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But in pretty well every other area, I’ve always wanted my gratification sooner, rather than later — even if that means piling up difficulties for the future. Internet shopping? Give me next-day delivery, every time, and to hell with the extra expense.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">Prudent</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hurry back from lunch to tackle the ever-growing mountain of correspondence on my desk — or linger at the pub for just one more pint? No contest, I’m ashamed to say. The pint always wins, while the mountain grows.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s the same with my tax return. Should I file now — or keep it hanging over me until the last minute and beyond, at the risk of incurring a fine? Let it wait.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Or take saving for retirement. Twit that I am, in my early years of parenthood I cashed in my first two pension pots when I moved jobs. In those days, the gas bill, the mortgage and our plans for a family holiday seemed far more important than the vague possibility that I might one day grow old. It’s because of this that I appear to have doomed myself to carry on churning out these weekly meanderings until well after my 65th birthday next month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, my more prudent contemporaries will be reaping the fruits of their additional voluntary contributions, with their feet up next to some pool by the Mediterranean. I just pity the poor readers. It’s not your fault.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I feel the same way about matters political. Though a passionate Brexiteer, of more than 40 years’ standing, I’ve long lost track of the befuddling array of options said to be open to us, from the Norway model to Canada Plus Plus.</p><img id="i-aec7e9017783194e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/19/00/5183632-6292863-image-m-11_1539906354466.jpg" height="444" width="634" alt="All I can say is that if Professor Mischel had tested me in my toddlerhood, I¿m quite sure I would have been among the very first to tuck in to my marshmallow, TOM UTLEY said.

Deal or no deal, I’m almost past caring — as long as we get out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My heart sank along with many others when it emerged this week that our negotiators are prepared to drag out this dismal process by extending the transition period to full Brexit by as much as another year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">Reward</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If so, a full five years will have passed since that glorious referendum before we finally regain the right to govern our own country. If we ever do.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Which brings me to my chief objection to the conclusions Professor Mischel drew from his experiment. Of course, those who can resist their marshmallows may argue that the extra wait for Brexit will be worthwhile if it means a better deal. But will it? If you ask me, it’s not merely weak will that makes some of us impatient to grab what we can, when we can. Trust — or our inability to trust — also comes into the equation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After all, the professor’s young guinea pigs couldn’t be sure that he would be as good as his word, when he promised those extra marshmallows to the children who waited. Nor could they be certain that another child (a future banker, perhaps) wouldn’t eat his own marshmallow — and then steal theirs at the last minute.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In those circumstances, it may have made good sense to some of the children to take what they could, while it was still on the table. A more extensive study than Professor Mischel’s, published earlier this year, suggests that children from poorer families are less likely to delay gratification, simply because they fear that what’s on offer may be taken away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All I know is that the more I see of the Brexit negotiators, on both sides of the table in Brussels, the less I trust them. Haven’t we every right to fear that they’re spinning this process out in the belief that the longer it takes, the better their chance of denying us Leavers the national sovereignty we were promised?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for those 30 per cent of the professor’s subjects who delayed their gratification, isn’t it possible that some of them simply didn’t like marshmallows — just as our negotiators patently don’t like Brexit?</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>It was only when TOM UTLEY read on it began to come back to me, and he realised that he was the American psychology professor who inspired one of the most interesting debates of our time.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Calm down, dears - Theresa May's plan may work... says DOMINIC SANDBROOK</strong></p><img id="i-cbc16b90ce27119f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/18/22/5181180-6292541-image-m-55_1539898927658.jpg" height="430" width="306" alt="Theresa May's suggestion that Britain might need an extended transition period in leaving the EU could be viewed as weakness" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the face of it, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/news/theresa_may/index.html">Theresa May</a>’s suggestion that Britain could extend its period of transition after leaving the <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/news/european-union/index.html">EU </a>looks like weakness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it’s easy to see why ardent Brexiteers are infuriated, not least because it could leave us facing a bill for an extra £10billion. And this on top of a divorce bill currently standing at some £39billion!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there is a difference between a sign of weakness and a recognition of reality. And Mrs May is nothing if not a realist. The central, unanswerable fact is that negotiations with the 27 member states have stalled over the Irish border.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And although some insist the issue can be solved through some miraculous but hitherto undiscovered technological fix, no such solution has presented itself.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May’s idea of an extended transition is an attempt to deal with that problem. In effect, she is offering to keep Britain inside the customs union and single market for another year – or as she puts it, a few months – so there is no border in Northern Ireland before a new arrangement is found.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Judging by some of her opponents’ more hysterical effusions, you might think she had offered to tear down Nelson’s Column and invited Jean-Claude Juncker to move into Buckingham Palace. In fact, she has merely suggested it might be worth abiding by EU rules for a little bit longer – if it buys us a better deal. Of course it’s not ideal. I don’t like the idea of paying an extra £10billion more than anybody else. But given that we have spent the last 45 years in the EU, a delay of a few months, even a year, should not strike even the most ardent Leaver as the end of the world.</p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also, an extra £10billion seems a small price to pay to avoid crashing out without a deal. A no-deal would be a disaster. A drop of 2 per cent in our annual economic growth in the next two years – which would be an unrealistically good outcome – would cost us at least £22billion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By comparison, even an additional 12 months under the EU’s umbrella, would hardly be economic Armageddon. We might not like it in principle, but in practice I suspect most of us would barely notice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The fact that Mrs May is a pragmatist is why her MPs put her in Downing Street in the first place. It would be an unconscionable act of treachery and irresponsibility if they stabbed her in the back now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Betrayal leaves us humiliated... says DANIEL HANNAN</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let me ask you a question. What do you think is the worst imaginable outcome of our EU talks? Is there something so ghastly that Eurosceptics and Europhiles alike would see it as more painful than either leaving or staying?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How about this? What if we kept every dot and comma of our existing EU obligations with only one change, namely that we lost our say over what they were. All of us, surely, can agree that that would be the most injurious status of all. We’d still be subject to the Common Agricultural and Fisheries Policies, to freedom of movement, to the budget levies, to the supremacy of EU over British law.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The only difference is that we’d no longer be able to block proposals we didn’t like. Indeed, the EU might bring forward measures that were specifically designed to hurt us – by, for example, seeking to shift financial services from London to Frankfurt – and we’d have to comply.</p><img id="i-959b04632175f20a" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/18/22/5181182-6292541-image-m-57_1539899077043.jpg" height="416" width="634" alt="Brussels likes the idea of extending the transition period.

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">You can see why Brussels likes the idea of extending the transition period. It is better than anything Eurocrats had hoped for – better even than the prospect of undoing Brexit, and seeing a humiliated Britain begging for readmission without its rebate. It would give them full control of the UK economy with no British veto.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why are we contemplating the idea? If reports are to be believed, we are ready to be a Euro-colony for at least three years. I say ‘at least’ because, once Brussels had us in such a position, it would have no incentive to discuss anything further. Our thraldom might become permanent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’re told that we need time to sort out the outstanding withdrawal issues, but hardly anyone believes that. The only outstanding issue is the Irish border. Even if you accept there is a problem – and the relevant customs officials say there is no logistical need for physical checks at the frontier – it is hard to see how an extra year would solve anything.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The two sides have set out their positions, and either London or Brussels will have to give way. If that’s going to happen, it might as well happen now. An extra year won’t solve anything.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Supporters of this climbdown seem to think that the only thing that matters is having something that can be technically called ‘Brexit’ – even if that something patently fails to address all the concerns that both Leavers and Remainers have expressed. In fact, literally any outcome – Norway, Switzerland, no deal, postponing our departure – would be better than non-voting membership. It’s extraordinary that that should need saying.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>DOMINIC SANDBROOK and DANIEL HANNAN take opposing views on whether Theresa May's bid to secure an extension to the Brexit transition period will be a success or an utter disaster.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Dominic Sandbrook and Daniel Hannan for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-19T11:29:57.000+02:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>DOMINIC SANDBROOK and DANIEL HANNAN discuss transition deals</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-19T11:29:57.000+02:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/18/22/5181180-0-image-a-50_1539898913140.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1208279</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Getty Images</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6292503/Former-Brexit-minister-savages-Theresa-Mays-plan-extend-Brexit-transition-period.html" title="'It's dead on arrival': Former Brexit minister savages Theresa May's plan to extend Brexit transition period as BOTH wings of her party 'mobilise to overthrow her' amid growing Tory anger at new concession"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6292325/QUENTIN-LETTS-sees-EU-leaders-delight-delay.html" title="Juncker and Tusk wheezed with laughter, taking the pils: QUENTIN LETTS sees EU leaders delight in delay "></link></item><item><title>Juncker and Tusk wheezed with laughter, taking the pils: QUENTIN LETTS sees EU leaders delight in delay </title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6292325/QUENTIN-LETTS-sees-EU-leaders-delight-delay.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Oct 2018 21:05:09 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6292325</guid><description><![CDATA[Would the Brexit process need yet more time?

Oooh yes, yes, yes, the Europeans liked that idea. Time means more of our pounds sterling. Time means a chance to screw us harder to their Titanic deck.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Donald Tusk, the Pole who chairs the European Council, smiled wolfishly in Brussels yesterday when asked about it at a press conference.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I’m sure the leaders [of the EU countries] would be ready to consider this positively,’ he purred. Translation: our embuggeration strategy is working better than we dared hope and the British officials haven’t a clue what we’re up to.

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Ditto his comedy partner Jean-Claude Juncker, who runs the European Commission. With those hooded, diagonal eyes, an avuncular, seemingly sober Juncker said: ‘This prolongation of the transition period probably will happen. It’s a good idea.’ It would allow ‘more room’ for negotiations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More time, more room, more possibilities for stiffing democracy, for cementing the technocrats in their spanking palaces and for exasperating the voters. Already it has been 28 months since we elected to leave the EU. Yet the elite is still not ready. And they are doing this, or we are letting them do this, by confecting an entirely non-problem of an Irish ‘hard border’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When a BBC reporter asked the two men about various customs proposals and border fixes being discussed over Brexit, Tusk shrugged and said happily ‘it is for me too complex’. Juncker retorted: ‘For me, it’s too easy.’ The commission’s president was having a ball. And with our pathetic Whitehall officials, who can blame him?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Both Tusk and Juncker wheezed with laughter. Delighted tinkles of mirth. They were taking the pils.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Talking of which, EU leaders went out for beers in the Brussels Grand Place on Wednesday night, sans Theresa May. Aw, guys. She’s such fun on a night out!</p><img id="i-7abd885ba07b81b3" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/18/15/5166190-0-image-a-33_1539871497991.jpg" height="420" width="634" alt="Reports today suggest discussion was focused on Mrs May's (pictured at the summit today) domestic political problems after the 27 leaders agreed to say 'nothing happened at dinner'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Shortly before the Tusk-Juncker double-act, doggychops Angela Merkel – the only person in European politics who makes Mrs May look chirrupy – grunted zat she was ‘neither more pessimistic nor more optimistic’ about the Brexit talks. As she hunched there in front of a banner saying ‘Europaischer Rat’, it was worth stressing that Rat is German for ‘council’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Were Tusk and Juncker quite as happy as their public performance suggested? Film footage showed Tusk shouting at Juncker’s svengali Martin Selmayr, shaking his limbs with animation. It looked quite a bate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May’s press conference came a short while later. I watched it on the BBC’s News Channel. Jeepers, they’re blatant. One bloke, talking about the Irish backstop, rhapsodised about the sincerity of the Irish government.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May’s mood was not as brittle as after the Salzburg punch-up but she still seemed twitchy, an impression not helped by that dreadful barbed-wire necklace. She does not radiate confidence at these summits. It’s like seeing a learner driver on Hyde Park Corner.</p><img id="i-69402a36346a3002" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/18/15/5166196-0-image-a-30_1539871432886.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Theresa May made her speech in the lurid European Council room (pictured today) before leaving the EU leaders to discuss Brexit over dinner " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">We heard the usual cotton wool about ‘good progress’ and ‘intensifying the work’. Why does she bother trying to sound constructive? They’re not being remotely constructive to her. Why even turn up? Why kiss Juncker?

And so it is contemplating a move that would make it unpopular with many people — one that might even call the licence fee into question.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Auntie’s plan is to scrap or restrict free television licences for people over 75. The cost of this subsidy is expected to be about £745 million a year by 2021-22, which is about a fifth of the Corporation’s licence fee income.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Who can doubt that many older pensioners — who tend to watch television much more than the young — would find such a development extremely distressing?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You may ask why on earth it is the BBC, rather than the Government, which is proposing to withdraw a benefit that is of such value to millions of people. It is a good question.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To some degree, the villain of the piece is George Osborne. In 2015, the then Chancellor announced, not unreasonably, that the Beeb should share some of the pain of austerity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But instead of demanding a reduction in the licence fee, Mr Osborne made the BBC gradually take on the cost previously borne by government of subsidising free television licences for those over 75. The process will be complete by 2020, when Auntie will have full responsibility. In effect, she has been put in charge of a branch of social policy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No one should be surprised by the outcome. The BBC has an insatiable appetite for money. It finds itself footing a bill it doesn’t want to pay. And so, rather than paying it, the Corporation intends to get rid of it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The consequences will be deplorable if the plan goes ahead. On the management floor of the BBC, where six-figures salaries are commonplace, the annual £150.50 cost of a licence fee may look like chicken feed. To many pensioners, however, it is a significant amount.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And here, it seems to me, Auntie has been playing dirty. She has commissioned a consultancy called Frontier Economics to review the options. Does this mean the firm has felt under pressure to come up with recommendations favourable to the Beeb?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a preliminary discussion paper published yesterday, Frontier Economics argued that there had been ‘profound economic changes’ since the benefit was introduced in 2001. Pensioners are now ‘the least likely age group’ to live in poverty.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, of course, the BBC and Frontier Economics are deliberately playing into a common perception: namely that oldies are making hay while many millennials are unable to imagine owning a house or even having expectations of a decent standard of living.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is certainly true some young people are having a hard time of it. But it is not the case that most pensioners are living high on the hog. This is a canard that must be exposed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For although the state pension has risen in recent years faster than other benefits, it remains paltry compared with what is available in other developed countries. So said the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) earlier this year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It claimed that the basic pension of £122.30 a week (it has since gone up very slightly) was the least generous in the West. According to the OECD, it is worth just 29 per cent of average earnings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By comparison, in the Netherlands the basic state pension is 100.6 per cent of average earnings. In France, it is 74.5 per cent. In Germany, 50.5 per cent. Britain even came behind poorer countries such as Chile, Poland and Mexico.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So the idea that pensioners in this country are somehow uniquely well off is tosh. Admittedly, some of them also receive private pensions, but in many cases these rarely exceed a few thousand pounds a year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is why the BBC should not be allowed to get away with the fashionable misconception that old people are on some sort of roll, and have been enjoying huge privileges at the expense of the young.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Needless to say, I accept there are some older residents in the 4.5 million homes receiving a free television licence who could afford to pay. But I doubt whether it is practicable, without a vast, costly and very possibly inequitable bureaucracy, to identify them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wouldn’t it be more seemly if, before hammering the elderly, the Corporation took a closer look at its own gigantic expenditure? The apparent conviction of its senior management that it has already cut itself to the bone is pretty laughable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, is it really plausible that no further inroads could be made into BBC1’s massive annual budget of £1,125 million? Trimming a few salaries of so-called stars earning hundreds of thousands of pounds a year would be a useful start. I doubt Gary Lineker would walk away from Match Of The Day if his £1.7 million salary were slashed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The BBC spends £196 million a year on online and digital services. Couldn’t its ubiquitous website (which has probably helped drive some local newspapers to extinction) be reined in? It seems no less ‘imperial’ in its scope than when George Osborne justly used that word to describe it a few years ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there is the BBC’s unwieldy management, which still accounts for hundreds of millions of pounds. While it’s true there has been some cost-cutting on this front, it is nearly always the case that public bodies forced to accept some savings are capable of making more. Not so long ago, the BBC advertised for a Head of Change on a salary of £78,000, no less — though what the job entailed wasn’t remotely clear.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would rightly be viewed as an outrage if Auntie — who, despite everything, still has a place in many hearts — were to deprive ordinary pensioners of a cherished and long-established perk while failing to put her own house in order.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Old people, after all, can be vulnerable. Sometimes they are even confused. I can’t imagine the Beeb wants to be held answerable for spreading dismay and unhappiness among this particular group of people, who ironically are often its biggest fans — even though the BBC sometimes gives the impression it is obsessed with attracting younger viewers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The risk of going ahead with this ill-conceived proposal, I suggest, is that many of us would be strengthened in our suspicion that, when it comes to securing its own funding, the apparently public-spirited BBC can behave like the most rapacious commercial organisation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an ideal world, of course, the licence fee would be jettisoned, and replaced with some sort of subscription service, since it makes no sense in a multi-channel world to make people who seldom, if ever, watch the BBC stump up to keep it going.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But that argument has been put on ice for the foreseeable future following the Government’s probably rash agreement in 2016 to maintain the licence fee until at least 2027.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We can most of us sympathise with the predicament the BBC finds itself in. Thanks to a sleight of hand by Mr Osborne, it has been cast in the role of social provider, discharging a duty that should properly be the Government’s.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, for better or worse, it is a burden the Corporation must bear. Scrapping free television licences would hurt millions of hard-pressed elderly people — as well as the BBC. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The BBC believes it is strapped for cash.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong> Company, Gielgud Theatre</strong></p><p class="mol-ratings"><strong>Rating: <strong><img class="rating" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/articles/ratingStars/rating_showbiz_4.gif" width="55" /></strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet another old show has been warmed up with gender bending. Company, a 1970 musical comedy by Stephen Sondheim and George Furth, originally described the Manhattan japes of a bed-hopping heterosexual bachelor, aged 35, and his reluctant contemplation of marriage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But we can’t have men behaving like that nowadays. Director Marianne Elliott has therefore switched the whole thing round and turned male lead Bobby into career woman Bobbie. The story is now set in the 21st century and the various married couples have also been chopped and changed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is all quite clever and – given that the original storyline is now probably too politically incorrect to stage – it allows a new generation of audiences to experience this early Sondheim.</p><img id="i-b9c907f12196e22b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/18/01/5147362-0-image-a-1_1539822871740.jpg" height="597" width="634" alt="Toast: a sketch of  Patti LuPone and Rosalie Craig, starts of Company which is directed by Marianne Elliott" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In places the score is evocative of Burt Bacharach, with less of the melodic stop-and-start found in later Sondheim.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Songs include the title number Company, Someone Is Waiting and a patter song, Getting Married Today, which is done brilliantly by Jonathan Bailey.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the original version this song belongs to a fiancee on her wedding day. Here it is a gay man having pre-marriage jitters in his kitchen.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It becomes the evening’s show-stealer, complete with a singing priest who keeps popping out from the fridge and from the kitchen worktop with a wedding-cake hat. Tremendous hoot.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other moments, particularly in the first 45 minutes, are perilously slow. My eyelids started to droop.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Former TV Bake-Off host Mel Giedroyc is in a busy cast – she plays a middle-aged wife who is trying to lose weight, one of several friends who urge Bobbie to settle down but whose own married lives are not exactly blissful.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The episodic nature of the story keeps the action varied and Patti LuPone shows her vocal chops with the song The Ladies Who Lunch. She rather shows up some of the other singers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bobbie herself is an under-written character. Rosalie Craig, who could almost be Sarah Jessica Parker’s twin, turns in a trim central performance; but it is hard to make much emotional investment in her romantic quandary, not least because marriage is less of a must-do these days than it was in New York half a century ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For its snappy production values, for Getting Married Today and for the walnut-veneered luxury of Miss LuPone’s presence, as well as the inventiveness of the gender switching, it’s just about a four-star evening. But a show to admire rather than love.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>QUENTIN LETTS: Another old show has been warmed up with gender bending.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Wildlife programmes are one of the few reasons for buying a television licence. You get to see all sorts of fascinating things such as the mating rituals of red-eared slider turtles, close-ups of insects’ compound eyes and the Sisyphean progress of the humble dung beetle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there are predator scenes — brilliant sequences of chase and death when a cheetah or lion bags an antelope for its lunch. Silent-pawed prowl is followed by a flurry of acceleration and a puff of prairie dust as the prey, anguished moans relayed with slow-motion, is clawed and ripped by ravenous fangs. ‘Our big cat,’ says a honeyed voice-over, ‘will not go hungry tonight.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What, then, are we to make of the suggestion from Sir David Attenborough, the very archbishop of wildlife film-makers, that carnivores need to alter their ways?</p><img id="i-8f9235b9804f5f54" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/18/01/5147058-0-image-a-24_1539821888385.jpg" height="585" width="634" alt="Last week we heard from Nature magazine that CO2, methane and nitrous oxide levels from meat production are unsustainably high and that we should adopt a more ¿flexitarian¿ diet if climate change is to be alleviated" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-332e9666df51b002" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/18/01/5146976-0-image-a-25_1539821916823.jpg" height="509" width="634" alt="Sir David Attenborough, the very archbishop of wildlife film-makers, has said that carnivores need to alter their ways" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says meat-eating is ‘no longer practical’ because it endangers the planet.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meat-free Mondays are the new thing, as is Veganuary, when people give up animal products for a month at the start of the year. A YouGov poll suggests almost one in five of 18-24 year olds now believe the future will be meat-free.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All of which seems harmless enough, except that other less cuddly vegans have taken it upon themselves to target meat-eaters and producers in a far more sinister way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Death threats to farmers by militant vegans have been on the rise, while protesters have vandalised farms with graffiti. Pig farmers have reported being woken up at night by activists.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These threats are becoming such a problem that the Association of Independent Meat Suppliers has even had to seek advice from counter-terror police.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I suppose Sir David Attenborough has earned the right to be heard on just about any topic he cares to discuss. But when I read about so-called militant vegans attacking an industry that employs thousands and feeds millions, it only makes me more determined to order a rump steak.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When I cook at home, say a vat of cassoulet bubbling with goose legs and pork belly, or a flash-fried slice of pink-inside lamb’s liver dusted with flour and Norwich mustard and a scrunch of black pepper, the dog and I just stand there gulping, our eyes as round as gobstoppers, nostrils twitching as we quiver with greedy anticipation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ah, meat. Loverly meat. Corrugations of its uniquely savoury scent rise from the pan, pure olfactory hypnosis, and at the sound of a rumbling tummy I look down at my Patterdale terrier companion and say: ‘Good heavens, Flip, was that you or me?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet now we are being told to forgo this pleasure. Flesh is verboten, or at least terribly infra dig.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am not one of your anti-veggie militants. Far from it. Curried spinach, stuffed tomatoes, cabbage in all configurations, spuds anyhow they come, lentil soups, bean medleys: all these and more I happily cook and eat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I admire vegetarians and vegans for their self-discipline and their devotion to the cause. My siblings have been vegetarians for decades, my mother rarely eats meat and my wife, Lois, was veggie when I met her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there is something visceral about meat, and I do not just mean its blood and guts and those little tubular bits you get in kidneys (kidneys in cream and garlic are my favourite Saturday breakfast). Some people may be able to do without it but for me there comes that frequent, gnawing desire, as deep as coal under the Rhondda valley, for a chomp of brawn.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Glazed spare ribs, perhaps. Or a rabbit terrine. Roast pheasant with game chips. Or faggots. Now you’re talking. Our butcher in Fownhope, Herefordshire, does faggots with the goo-iest gravy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lois fell off the meat-free wagon when she came round to my basement flat in Paddington one evening in the Eighties before we married and I was cooking some Toulouse sausages made by a veteran Fleet Street reporter and part-time butcher called Bill O’Hagan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The late Bill, whose snorkers contained high-quality meat and no synthetic additives, was almost single-handedly responsible for the revival of proper sausage-making in Britain. Lois could not resist a bite of that succulent Toulouse saussie and she has been a lusty carnivore ever since.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">American comedienne Roseanne Barr, a good Jewish girl, once wrote that she left home in order to eat pork and take birth-control pills.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘When I first shared an intimate evening with my husband,’ she said, ‘I was swept away by the passion, so dormant inside me, of a long and tortured existence. The physical cravings I had tried so hard to deny were finally sated. But enough about the pork.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any doubts I may have had about the naturally carnivorous condition of homo sapiens were cleared once and for all when our younger daughter, Honor, was a toddler.</p><img id="i-3425530f6b0f5d82" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/18/01/5147056-0-image-a-26_1539821946089.jpg" height="357" width="634" alt="Millenials are increasingly snubbing meat such as these thick cut steaks " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">We were on holiday abroad and someone ordered squid. Honor, in her high chair, threw aside her plastic tub of pink yoghurt and started bawling and pointing at the fish dish. She shut up only when we gave her some squid, her mouth broadening into a slightly menacing, cave-baby smile as tendrils of grilled cephalopod poked out of it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She also took hungrily to whitebait and to sardines, eyes and bones and roe and all. Yum yum. Much better than any sissy bowl of carrot puree.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The morals of meat-eating do trouble some, and it would be wrong to dismiss those fears out of hand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How can modern mankind square killing sentient beings?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is little good these days pointing out that in the Old Testament they are always sacrificing goats and sheep — which were no doubt enthusiastically scoffed by temple orderlies. Nor is the argument about ‘eating to live’ quite enough. Most vegetarians are perfectly healthy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have my doubts about Muslim halal butchery, now widespread in this country. It involves slitting animals’ throats rather than killing them with a bolt gun.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our most thoughtful TV cook, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, argues strongly for ethical meat-eating. He urges us to buy meat that has been reared and slaughtered humanely. He also makes the point that most meat comes from farm animals, which would otherwise never exist and that short, domesticated lives are better than no lives at all, provided the animals are well tended.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As Sir David Attenborough would attest, wild animals tend to meet more violent ends than farmed livestock. Britain’s distinctive countryside would not be nearly so attractive were it not grazed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But need we be so hesitant about also making the argument that meat is a gastronomic marvel?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the most memorable lunches of my 55 years was during Tony Blair’s beef-on-the-bone ban, when we went to the house of a Gloucestershire magistrate and, amid the toe-curling excitement of a Twenties Chicago speakeasy, he served us a vast baron of beef.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My gums still salivate at the memory, and I swear we all honoured the beast that day as he forked into its glistening carcass. Nut cutlets would have been more virtuous and possibly more eco-friendly. But they would not have been such a celebration of life in all its splendour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Wildlife programmes are one of the few reasons for buying a television licence.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Near the end of PMQs we had a down-the-chimney bomblet from Julian Lewis (Con, New Forest E). With two sentences he flattened the bogus problem of this ‘Irish hard border’ which keeps being raised by Brussels and Whitehall as the reason we must capitulate and effectively stay in the <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/news/european-union/index.html">EU</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Lewis’s question in full: ‘The next time shroud-waving EU negotiators claim a hard border is necessary, will the Prime Minister kindly ask them who would actually construct it? The Irish certainly will not and the British certainly will not, so unless the EU army plans to march in and build it, it surely can never happen.’ Laughter from Eurosceptics. A twitch of irritation from <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/philip-hammond/index.html" id="mol-9ef0c2d0-d252-11e8-9511-552f688e6af3">Philip Hammond</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/news/theresa_may/index.html">May</a>’s answer was unmarbled by joviality. Click went the telephone answering machine button and out came the lifeless message: ‘We are all working to ensure there will be no hard border...’ She really is remarkably stodgy. Mrs Gromyko. Her answer was so grim, you might almost think she WANTED the Irish border to be a problem. </p><img id="i-62689d9fbd421c3" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/17/22/5142948-6288087-image-a-17_1539811345941.jpg" height="340" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-a30e47e05a4435fa" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/17/21/5141644-0-image-a-2_1539808601673.jpg" height="341" width="634" alt="The Conservative benches were not full and whips had to resort with dotting ministers in place of the missing MPs who did not want to be caught yawning or stabbing their fingers in their eyeballs to distract from the pain of listening to their leader" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Conservative benches were not full. In past eras, PMQs packed the Chamber. Many Tory MPs now stay away rather than be caught on camera yawning or stabbing their fingers in their eyeballs to distract from the pain of listening to their leader.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The same sort of thing went on at the recent Tory party conference where the main hall was frequently near-empty. Government Whips had resorted to an old ruse of West End theatre producers on gala nights – ie they ‘dressed the House’. In the theatre this means giving free tickets to friends so that the auditorium is crowded, giving an impression of popular success. At Westminster, ‘dressing the house’ means littering the backbenches with ministers. Plug the gaps!</p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the Tory backbenches yesterday sat numerous frontbenchers: Nigel Adams, Margot James, Sarah Newton, Shailesh Vara, Robert Jenrick, ‘Sir’ Michael Ellis (not really knighted but it can only be a matter of time, so grandiloquent is he), Stephen Barclay, Robert Buckland and Nurse Milton, the former bed-pan orderly from Guildford. Other MPs manspread their thighs to take up more room and hide the bad box-office. </p><img id="i-199cf994a8ec0746" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/18/12/5142946-6288087-Julian_Lewis_pictured_asked_the_PM_about_the_so_called_Irish_bac-a-17_1539860831041.jpg" height="467" width="306" alt="Julian Lewis, pictured, asked the PM about the 'so-called' Irish backstop" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Things had opened with an unexpectedly truculent question from Sheryll Murray (Con, SE Cornwall), normally a sunny soul. She wanted the Government to publish ‘in full all its EU exit modelling’. Translation: we don’t trust the Treasury and Downing Street officials any more.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jeremy Corbyn was on sprightly form, mentioning Mr Hammond’s latest sabotage job on Brexit (putting it round that we will still have to pay more than £30billion to Brussels even with no deal). When Mr Corbyn made a little gag about this, Mrs May was unamused but Mr Hammond laughed. Mocking his own PM while sitting right next to her? You wouldn’t want to go up in a training aircraft with that man. He’d activate your ejector seat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Beside him, International Aid Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who is one of the Cabinet Brexiteers aghast at Downing Street’s performance, flicked a ballpoint pen repeatedly in the talons of her right hand. Mrs May rallied with her final answer to Mr Corbyn.</p><img id="i-36fcf63b2c86e36e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/17/21/5141650-0-image-a-3_1539808687547.jpg" height="348" width="634" alt="Jeremy Corbyn, pictured, was on sprightly form today mentioning Philip Hammond's latest sabotage job on Brexit by claiming Britain would still have to pay £30bn in the event of no deal" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">She had the gumption to remember that the latest employment figures were excellent and she found a rallying cry that had her benches cheering.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finally, we saw a champion toppled. Alan Mak (Con, Havant) has for some time been the House’s most assiduous bootlicker, a man whose sycophancy has astonished and thrilled. Yesterday he had a question and settled for welcoming extra money for the NHS and hoping it would be spent on medical technology.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Helpful but low-key. It was not a patch on some Dyson-standard suction from Simon Hoare (Con, N Dorset), who went into prolonged rapture, and nearly rupture, about the jobs figures. What an aria. His crawling was worthy of a centipede.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">What a busy few days for the Royal Family. First Princess Eugenie's wedding, with its star-studded guest list and unchained extravagance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then the announcement, on Monday, of a new arrival for the Duke and <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/tvshowbiz/meghan-markle/index.html" id="mol-e7fa4df0-d1a5-11e8-bd89-4d289ce99202">Duchess of Sussex</a>, their first child. And at the centre of it all, a Duchess of extraordinary ambition and drive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not Meghan. Not even Kate. I'm talking about Sarah Ferguson, who has just staged a royal comeback not even her staunchest supporters could have predicted.</p><img id="i-131637e12e5661d2" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/17/01/5110748-6284283-image-a-9_1539736747271.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="'Even now, aged 59, Fergie seem to help herself.

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">This is a woman who, for the past two decades, has been viewed by public and Palace alike as an embarrassment, and permanently on the fringes of failure. Who since her departure from the royal fold in 1992 after that toe-sucking scandal with oil tycoon John Bryan has undertaken a long and very public walk of shame.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's a walk, however, that finally, victoriously, came to an end last Friday with her seated front and centre alongside the Queen and Prince Philip in St George's Chapel, Windsor.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Along the way she has suffered personal and financial humiliation, found herself the object of ridicule and scorn — and has got herself into more pickles than you'll find in a jar of gherkins, not least the 2010 'cash for access' scandal, which saw her offering an audience with ex-husband Prince Andrew, in return for £500,000.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">That, by her own admission, was one of her lowest points, a 'huge lapse of judgment' brought about by the fact she had been drinking and was desperate for money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even now, aged 59, she can't seem to help herself. At the wedding she was about as subtle as a Panzer tank, galumphing up the aisle in her high heels to her seat in the front row.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On Monday, just as the long-awaited news of the Duchess of Sussex's pregnancy was revealed to the world, Fergie started tweeting on and on about her daughter's day and her own wedding outfits, seemingly determined not to allow the news to upstage Eugenie.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The woman is utterly incorrigible. And yet. There is something about her indefatigable, indestructible nature that I can't help but admire. Something in her propensity for pratfalls of her own making that makes her so much more human than other royals. It's not just her ability to bounce back each time she gets knocked down — although what tenacity she must have shown in the face of an Arctic royal froideur, to have ended up back on such good terms with Andrew and living under the same roof.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nor is it that she is clearly a mother devoted to her daughters. Nor even her, at times, toe-curling honesty about her own failings and feelings of insecurity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's the fact that in her, I recognise so many of my own shortcomings and mistakes. She once said many of her problems stem 'from desperately trying to please' — a notion I am all too familiar with.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unlike Meghan and Kate, both of whom are unimpeachable in their behaviour, Fergie is — like so many of us — a bit of a mess. But she's a well-meaning, warm-hearted mess. And that makes us warm to her, despite everything.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Only a heart of stone could have remained unmoved by her look of sheer joy as she alighted at St George's Chapel. Or the way she huffed and puffed nervously in the pews, grinning, gurning and waving in excitement at old friends in the congregation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She's like a human labrador: clumsy, over-excitable, greedy, prone to causing breakages with her constantly wagging tail — but ultimately impossible to remain angry with for all that long.</p><div class="item">

There he is, smiling grimly in the wedding photographs, as Fergie, luminous in emerald green, beams away behind him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there's another reason that, at long last, Fergie's stars have started to align. It's not just what she is; it's also what she is not. Dull.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no doubt the two younger royal spouses — Kate and Meghan — are a class act. Neither ever seems to put a toe wrong, from the way they dress to the platitudes that pass their lips. They are the ultimate royal consorts, polished, dutiful, beautiful and devoted to acts of selfless generosity. Lovely, of course. But humdrum.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fergie, by contrast, is a riot. She belongs to a different age, a pre- millennial, pre-virtue signalling, un-woke world which, for all its flaws, was authentic and quite often fun.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fergie makes me long for the bad old royals, the ones in the Princess Margaret mould who were shockingly, appallingly awful. But at least they kept us all entertained.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wonderful as Meghan and Kate are, they are also a little anodyne, a bit too good to be true. Something Fergie could never be accused of.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Read the figures released yesterday that show more than 94,000 ‘hate crimes’ were committed over a 12-month period and you might imagine they all consisted of cases such as mosques being firebombed or Orthodox Jews being attacked in the street.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those are, of course, very serious offences that deserve to be treated in the severest way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At first sight, the statistics seem to suggest a rapidly rising intolerance of Britons towards each other — and give succour to the Government’s proposals to extend the definition of hate crime to include acts of misogyny, contempt towards the elderly and even misandry, or hatred of men.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I can’t read those figures without remembering the many spurious cases where jokes, rude remarks or rough-and-tumble political debate have been recorded as ‘hate crimes’ or ‘hate incidents’.</p><img id="i-6c95cb9830f8efeb" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/17/01/5110422-6284355-image-a-2_1539735843395.jpg" height="446" width="306" alt="Take the Labour MP Barry Sheerman, who recently said that he had reported a pro-Brexit group to the police for including the hashtag ‘#Fascist’ in a tweet criticising Tory MP Anna Soubry for wanting to overturn the Brexit vote" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ridiculous</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Take the Labour MP Barry Sheerman, who recently said that he had reported a pro-Brexit group to the police for including the hashtag ‘#Fascist’ in a tweet criticising Tory MP Anna Soubry for wanting to overturn the Brexit vote. It may be a ridiculous exaggeration — but a hate crime?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was the case, too, of a Somerset landlady investigated by police for using a Welsh flag as a target in a St George’s Day archery competition; and the Scottish man convicted of a hate crime for teaching his pet dog to perform a Nazi salute as a (not at all funny) joke.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, Nottinghamshire Police have been running a pilot scheme in which they treat wolf-whistling as a hate crime. Yes, they have been branding as ‘hate criminals’ scaffolders who whistle at female passers-by.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That might be boorish, but to try to elevate it to the same level as anti-Semitic rantings or racist abuse is ridiculous.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All it achieves is to dilute genuine hate crimes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Notionally, we are in the midst of an epidemic of hate crime, in which reported offences have doubled in the past six years. Yet how can we know the true picture when the figures include trivial incidents that would once have gone unrecorded?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is hardly any wonder that reported hate crime is exploding when police forces have gone fishing for it — in fact, they even want to hear about minor incidents that don’t qualify as hate crimes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last month, for example, South Yorkshire Police tweeted: ‘Please report non-crime hate incidents, which can include things like offensive or insulting comments online, in person or in writing.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In other words, police chiefs — who are forever moaning about a shortage of resources — are imploring us to ring them up and report that we have been called a ‘twerp’, or whatever.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Frankly, the police should be spending more time trying to solve serious crimes — especially those that involve a direct physical threat to other citizens.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This week, it was reported one force has been sending letters to suspected paedophiles, politely asking that they desist from their activities. The police say this is because they don’t have enough evidence to charge these people, so they send them a warning to stop what they’re doing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What lunacy! If the police suspect someone is likely to harm a child, surely they should be pursuing them with the full force of the law and all necessary manpower. Or are too many officers spending their time logging ‘hate crimes’?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not only that, but this misguided new focus has had the perverse effect of exacerbating community tensions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the aftermath of the Brexit referendum in 2016, for example, a smashed glass door at a Spanish restaurant in London was widely quoted as an example of a wave of hatred against foreign nationals — until it was pointed out police were treating it as a burglary.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, too often, the concept of hate crime is being used as a political tool. Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd found this out to her cost two years ago, when her speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham was reported to the police by an Oxford academic who objected to her proposal (soon dropped) that employers should be obliged to compile a list of foreign nationals on their staff.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The matter was investigated by West Midlands Police, who later announced that, while no criminal offence was committed, it had been recorded as a ‘non-crime hate incident’.</p><img id="i-b664fe8ddd903b26" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/17/01/5110488-6284355-image-a-15_1539736140100.jpg" height="425" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable was reported to police for a speech in which he claimed that Brexiteers were mostly older people ‘driven by nostalgia for a world where passports were blue [and] faces were white’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His charge might have been absurd — plenty of young people and ethnic minorities voted for Brexit — but surely it falls within the bounds of robust political debate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If anyone hoped that the experiences of Rudd and other politicians would have tempered their enthusiasm for expanding the scope of hate crime, they have been bitterly disappointed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last month, the Government announced the Law Commission will examine proposals to extend the definition of hate crime to include misogyny and hatred based on the membership of alternative cultures such as goths and punks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, sneering at Sid Vicious wannabes could, in future, be a criminal offence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Hostility</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yesterday, the Government went further still, saying that the Law Commission will also consider whether to include misandry, the hatred of men.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But why does the concept of hate crime need to be widened at all? What ministers should be doing is rewording its definition, which was framed by the Crown Prosecution Service and Association of Chief Police Officers and identifies a hate crime as ‘any criminal offence which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice towards someone based on a personal characteristic’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The problem is the word ‘perceived’. That means anyone can interpret a comment or action as a hate crime and police officers are obliged to take it seriously — even when it is clear to the rest of us that the accuser is shouting ‘hate crime’ in order to try to silence a political opponent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The police are not obliged to treat every insult reported to them as a hate crime, but if it does not reach the threshold of a criminal offence, it still has to be recorded as a ‘hate incident’ — giving the impression that Britain is awash with hate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Disturbing</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That was what happened with Amber Rudd’s speech, as well as in the recent case of Boris Johnson’s newspaper column saying that women in burqas looked like ‘letterboxes’. In the end, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick announced that the former Foreign Secretary had not committed a crime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Naturally, the concept of hate crime does serve some purpose. If someone is caught daubing a Swastika on a synagogue — a troublingly likely event at a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise in Britain — the police need to be able to charge them with an offence greater than just spraying graffiti.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet, in other cases, it is hard to see why a particular crime should be classified as a hate crime. Is a murder classed as a hate crime really any worse than a murder that isn’t?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The inevitable implication is that murders will end up being treated less seriously in cases where murderer and victim are both of the same race, religion or cultural group.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The promotion of hate crime as a form of offending is part of a disturbing trend in which almost everything comes to be seen through identity politics.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We have endless victims’ groups demanding their own special treatment and trying to pigeonhole us all based on ethnicity, religion, sexuality and so on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But now that the Government is trying to extend the definition of hate crime further still, it seems, in future, we are all going to become victims.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe that is the point at which the concept of hate crime will become meaningless.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Take the Labour MP Barry Sheerman, who recently said that he had reported a pro-Brexit group to the police for including the hashtag ‘#Fascist’ in a tweet criticising Tory MP Anna Soubry for wanting to overturn the Brexit vote.

Why, the prime tantrum hurler himself, that vexatious little boiler Bercow. He is the King of Conniptions, the Caliph of Choler.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Few have more publicly, frequently, succumbed to the spitting red mist. Yet there he sat, refusing to budge from his great high place when Dame Laura Cox’s report on parliamentary abuse was debated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Bercow himself was criticised in that report. Anyone who has chaired anything, from a parochial church council to an over-50s nudist volleyball club, knows that if the meeting is likely to hear difficult allegations about your conduct, you step outside. Let someone else preside.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This Speaker is tone deaf to propriety.</p><img id="i-f097406b6c07609" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/16/21/5106124-6283569-image-a-23_1539722621554.jpg" height="306" width="634" alt="Tone deaf to propriety: John Bercow yesterday. The King of Conniptions, the Caliph of Choler" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The bullying scandal was raised by the rare and stalwart John Mann (Lab, Bassetlaw). Members hurried into the Chamber to hear Mr Mann, who spoke with a tremor of fury about the parliamentary inertia that has long stopped progress in these areas.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even before Mr Mann began, Bercow was on his feet to make a pre-emptive sally, saying ‘independence and transparency were the best guarantors’ against misconduct.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said ‘guarantor’ with one of those rolled rrrrrr’s with which he loves to lah-di-lard his pronouncements.</p><div>
</div><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Bercow groupies were out in force – the likes of Stephen Doughty (Lab, Cardiff S &amp; Penarth), who rose to deplore the Press’s interest in the scandal. ‘It is unhelpful for these matters to be discussed in the media,’ announced chum Doughty. Yes, sweep it under the carpet!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was no sign of Mr Bercow’s best man, Julian Lewis (Con, New Forest East). Another Bercow-ite, Charles Walker (Con, Broxbourne), chose to watch from just beyond the benches. But Labour frontbencher Valerie Vaz, whose brother Keith is so close to Bercow, was soon ladling praise over Mr Speaker for ‘making Parliament a more diverse place’. She fluttered her eyelashes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A wounding blow came from Maria Miller (Con, Basingstoke), a pro-diversity type who might have been expected to help Bercow. Instead she slid the letter-knife under his ribs, noting that the Cox report called for ‘a complete change in leadership – including you, Mr Speaker’. Bercow tried to smile but it did not quite work. The muscles at the corners of his mouth had frozen.</p><img id="i-a2fc0add96c73300" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/16/21/5106246-6283569-image-a-25_1539722736124.jpg" height="351" width="634" alt="A wounding blow came from Maria Miller (Con, Basingstoke), a pro-diversity type who might have been expected to help Bercow. Instead she slid the letter-knife under his ribs, noting that the Cox report called for ¿a complete change in leadership ¿ including you, Mr Speaker¿" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over the horizon galloped the quixotic form of James Duddridge (Con, Rochford), a terrific Bercow hater and Westminster’s least successful suicide bomber. He went into a long riff about how the Cox report identified ‘taunting, mocking, mimicking, making offensive comments’ etc., and then asked: ‘How can we encourage Mr Speaker to stop this behaviour?’ Bercow supporters were furious.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A wet little man from Ogmore, name of Elmore, shouted ‘outrageous!’ Mr Duddridge was soon being personally assailed for ‘bullying the Speaker’. Classic. Mr Bercow stands accused of treating staff horribly but must not be criticised in case it hurts his feelings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Bercow laughed ostentatiously at the Duddridge attack. He made a show of chatting to an aide. He nodded in approval when MPs made points which supported him. After a swingeing anti-Duddridge rant from Jess Phillips (Lab, Yardley), her neighbour Alison McGovern (Lab, Wirral S) trotted up to the Chair, gushed some words at Bercow and ended them with a little wink at him. Bercow supporters kept saying how appalling it was that anyone should try to use the issue for personal political ends. As if they themselves were not doing precisely that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For Ben Bradshaw (Lab, Exeter) it was, as ever, all about Brexit. Only Bercow could steer the Commons through Brexit! Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said she was sure the deputy Speakers would be able to manage it just as well.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Later we heard ‘friends of Mr Bercow’ were saying he would step down in nine months. Believe it when it happens. Since 2009 he has been a glowering, malevolent presence at the very centre of our parliamentary politics. He has wrought terrible damage. His departure can not come a moment too soon.</p><div class="item">

And former Labour culture secretary Ben Bradshaw told MPs the Speaker should stay on to ‘stand up for members’ against an ‘intolerable Brexit’.</p><img id="i-89b81b00c301a65" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/16/21/5106120-6283569-image-a-26_1539722945519.jpg" height="378" width="634" alt="Beleaguered John Bercow is finally quitting as Commons Speaker ¿ but not until next year because Labour MPs want him to remain to give them a say over Brexit" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last night, it was claimed Mr Bercow had told friends he intends to stand down as Commons Speaker next summer, though his office would not confirm this. It came after an extraordinary Commons debate in which MPs told Mr Bercow he should quit following a scathing report on Parliament’s ‘macho’ culture.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The report said bullying and sexual harassment had been allowed to ‘thrive’. Mr Bercow has personally faced bullying claims from former members of staff. He denies any wrongdoing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the Commons yesterday, Conservative MP Anne Main called for a regime change at the top, saying: ‘The fish rots from the head.’</p><img id="i-fcbad59c4de1fe9f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/16/21/5106656-6283569-image-a-45_1539723525864.jpg" height="417" width="306" alt="" class="img-no-border img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">And fellow Tory Maria Miller said there was a ‘shocking culture of fear and deference driven right from the top of the House of Commons’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The report is clear, there needs to be complete change in leadership at the most senior level – including you Mr Speaker – as chief officer if we are to press the reset button,’ she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Later however, on the Radio 4 PM programme, veteran Labour MP Dame Margaret Beckett said: ‘Abuse is terrible, it shouldn’t happen, behaviour should change anyway..</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But yes, if it comes to it... the most difficult decision we’ve made for hundreds of years [Brexit] trumps bad behaviour.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And Miss Thornberry told Sky News yesterday: ‘I think this is absolutely not the time to be changing Speaker.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We don’t know, for example, with regard to Brexit, what is going to happen: whether there is going to be, technically, an amendable motion or not... We do need to have all hands to the deck at the moment.’ Sir Kevin Barron, the outgoing chairman of the standards committee, accused her of prioritising Brexit, rather than ensuring Parliament was a safe place to work.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union of senior civil servants, called for her to stop putting ‘party politics before people’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Theresa May refused to publicly back Mr Bercow last night, saying his position was a matter for Parliament to decide. When elected Speaker in 2009, Mr Bercow pledged to stay in the role for no longer than nine years. That deadline passed on June 22 this year.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>With Parliament accused of bullying, who was in the Chair when MPs discussed these official findings?

In a large household which regularly plays host to 40 extra guests a week, many of them aristocrats, that makes upwards of half a ton of skin scales a year. Once you have loaded all these scales onto the farm trailer, they may be put to excellent practical use by mixing them with a little water and flour and using the resultant sticky mixture to inject into the walls and ceilings of your farm cottages for insulation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the smaller farm cottages at Castle Mould is insulated entirely from the skin scales of the Marchioness of Mildew, who stayed on at the Castle for six and a half months last year after her train was delayed.</p><div class="mol-columnist moduleHalf mol-columnist-module"><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">What a bumper few days it's been for royal watchers everywhere. As if the sight of Prince Philip breathing the same air as Sarah Ferguson without having apoplexy wasn't thrilling enough, it has now been confirmed: The <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/tvshowbiz/meghan-markle/index.html" id="mol-97d294f0-d0d2-11e8-8022-2debdaa53711">Duchess of Sussex</a> is expecting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In some ways it's a relief. At 37, there was always a faint worry about Meghan's chances of conceiving naturally.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, she's as fit as a fiddle and looks much younger – but plenty of women her age do struggle. Mother nature is mother nature, and fertility falls off a cliff at 35, duchess or not.</p><img id="i-e6054db6490995c7" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/16/00/5076548-6279721-image-m-7_1539644451422.jpg" height="522" width="634" alt="The Duchess of Sussex arrives at Admiralty House in Sydney on the first day of the royal couple's visit to Australia yesterday.

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">She and Harry were always going to want to conceive sooner rather than later, particularly if they plan to emulate his brother and have two or three children. But then they are newlyweds with the time and inclination to start a family, so we should not be too surprised at yesterday's announcement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet there is, of course, more to this than just two young people who are clearly very much in love embarking on the great adventure of parenthood.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This pregnancy is special and symbolic on a number of different levels – and in a way that few royal babies have been since Jane Seymour succeeded in producing a son for Henry VIII, at the cost of her own life when she died a few days later.</p><img id="i-2d3e314bdeefcd7d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/15/23/5072338-6279721-image-m-4_1539644227505.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex arrive at Edes House in Chichester during an official visit to Sussex earlier this month. There is, of course, more to this than just two young people who are clearly very much in love embarking on the great adventure of parenthood" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's not just what this milestone will mean personally for Harry, who has always seemed the more vulnerable of the two princes and perhaps the one who struggled most after the divorce of his parents and the death of his mother. Hopefully, this chance to create his own family unit will finally help heal some of those wounds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He certainly looks the type who will make a great father – not only because he's a bit of a big kid himself, but also because he seems to possess his mother's emotional intelligence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Or what it will mean to Meghan, the single-minded Hollywood starlet who now, by virtue of royal marriage and motherhood, finds her place in history secured. As Fergie discovered, once you give birth to a Windsor prince's child, you are attached to The Firm for ever.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No, the most profound aspect of this news is what the reality of a mixed-race child being born into the Royal Family will mean to the aristocracy and to the country as a whole.</p><div>
</div><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">For the first time, the dream of a truly multicultural Britain will find expression in the very heart of the monarchy. By showing there is no barrier to who may take their place in the royal fold, Harry and his bride will help secure the future – and relevance – of this great institution for many years to come.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is, perhaps above all, the legacy of the People's Princess writ large.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, the way Meghan – despite her complex family history – has been embraced by the palace is a big part of that process. But there is a huge difference between simply tying the knot and actually starting a family. The former is a contract that can, if necessary, be dissolved. The latter represents an indelible commitment that can never be erased.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The fact is that once this baby comes, countless parents and children from mixed-race backgrounds up and down the country will, perhaps for the first time ever, look to the royals and see themselves reflected in the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their child.</p><img id="i-f8ddbfaea6e1e247" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/16/09/5076546-6279721-Prince_Harry_with_the_Duchess_of_Sussex_Meghan_yesterday_attendi-a-1_1539678928331.jpg" height="568" width="630" alt="Prince Harry with the Duchess of Sussex Meghan yesterday attending a welcome event in Sydney, Australia. Harry certainly looks the type who will make a great father ¿ not only because he¿s a bit of a big kid himself, but also because he seems to possess his mother¿s emotional intelligence" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Britain will, at long last, have a royal family that is genuinely representative of the people it serves. One that not only sweeps away cultural and racial barriers, but also wears its heart, its emotions and its imperfections on its sleeve.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not only will this be an historical first, it also signals a clear departure from the old-fashioned model of royalty, rigidly based on entitlement and rank, and rife with snobbery, to one that reaches out to a far wider circle. A much more informal, inclusive sort of institution with both purpose and relevance that genuinely seeks to speak to its subjects in a language they can not only understand but respect.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, not everyone will like this kind of monarchy. Indeed there are some, even within the ranks of the family itself, who relish the status quo. But they are the ones who are out of touch now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This baby is not just any baby. It is a symbol of the wider modernising agenda that Harry and Meghan – as well as Prince William and his wife Kate, descended from Geordie coalminers – have for the future. It is the embodiment of the revolutionary royal family they are striving to create.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the meantime, we'll have the pleasure of seeing another bonny child at Kensington Palace. And Meghan with swollen ankles? Knowing her, I wouldn't bet on it.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox femail" data-version="2" id="mol-104f6b70-d0d2-11e8-8022-2debdaa53711">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Was Fergie feeling upstaged?</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Sarah Feruson's decision to ignore yesterday's baby news in favour of more tweets about her daughter's nuptials prompted suggestions on social media that she may have been feeling upstaged.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 59-year-old, who celebrated her birthday yesterday, published several tweets reminding her 115,000 followers of Friday's wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She even posted a picture of herself in her designer dress at the exact moment Kensington Palace officially revealed the pregnancy.

Any ideas?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We have to focus on what people really care about.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Go on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Look, while Westminster is obsessing about the Brexit negotiations, everyone else is talking about a couple caught snogging on Strictly Come Dancing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What's Strictly Come Dancing?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's a television show.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Really?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, like The Great British Bake Off, only with dancing instead of cakes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">People actually watch this stuff?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In their millions. Almost as many as voted Leave.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I'm listening.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What if we could harness the popularity of these two programmes to some new Government initiative?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How so?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The NHS, for instance. We could do with something to take everybody's mind off the crisis in the health service.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Didn't we try that last week, suggesting people should see their GP 15 at a time, like Alcoholics Anonymous? Whose bright idea was that?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Never mind. Concentrate on the job in hand. What I'm suggesting is that we exploit the popularity of Strictly and Bake Off by announcing the NHS is going to offer free dancing and cookery lessons?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Oh, I dunno, to combat some disease or other. How about obesity? Dancing would help people lose weight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So it might. But teaching people how to bake a scrumptious stem ginger cake with cream cheese frosting and salted caramel isn't exactly the best way to tackle an obesity crisis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">True, but think of the publicity. We could even launch an ad campaign and get Prue Leith and Frankie Goes To Hollywood, from Bake Off, and Claudia Wossername from Strictly to front it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I like that.

Apparently, there are some people who go for days, weeks, even months without seeing another living soul.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I'm not surprised. They're all sitting at home watching Strictly Come Dancing and The Great British Bake Off. What's any of this got to do with the NHS?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We could produce a report saying loneliness causes strokes, Alzheimer's, heart disease, ingrowing toenails, take your pick. Then we say that by offering dancing classes and cookery lessons, we'll actually be saving the NHS money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And how much will that cost?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ball park, give or take, call it 20 mill for cash. Prue Leith doesn't come cheap. And we're already spending £1.8 million setting up a chain of community cafes to combat loneliness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I didn't know that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You were on holiday that day. The Prime Minister's announcing it to coincide with the next wave of Cabinet resignations over Brexit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why are we spending £1.8 million of taxpayers' money bankrolling a chain of cafes? Isn't that what Starbucks and Costa are for? You can't move for coffee shops on most High Streets these days.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">What's a couple of mill between friends? Drop in the ocean. The PM has promised we'll be spending an extra £20 billion on health.

Mrs May, you will be shattered to hear, disagreed. Amid the brouhaha, Speaker Bercow’s tonsils flapped like a pennant on the Solent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">MPs heckled, shouted, shook their heads, sucked their upper gums as if playing Monty Python crones. They aimed their crossness not so much at Mrs May as at one another and at that unavoidable fact of political life: Brexit was chosen by the electorate. The Grouse of Commons may hate that but it has happened.</p><img id="i-71beab4d7da88f87" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/15/21/5071392-6279143-image-m-5_1539633890621.jpg" height="386" width="306" alt="Theresa May wore a white coat yesterday afternoon for yet another Commons Statement on Brexit.

After repeatedly saying that ‘the people had a vote’ in 2016, she finally reverted to ‘I refer the Hon Member to the answer I gave earlier’. This made Tory Remainers such as Anna Soubry (Broxtowe) and Dominic Grieve (Beaconsfield) and their ilk – about six of them nesting at the back of the House – v. batey. Miss Soubry scolded the air in front of her sharp nose. Mr Grieve, who has finally tipped over the edge, to no great surprise, announced that he would not be supporting the Government on Brexit unless – stamp of little booties – he was given his second referendum.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May noted calmly that he had changed his position a fair bit over the months.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Boris Johnson (Con, Uxbridge &amp; S Ruislip) was called, there was more noise than when the England pack are going for a pushover try at Twickenham. Mayhem. In the event, Mr Johnson created no difficulties for Mrs May and reserved his criticism for Jeremy Corbyn. David Davis (Con, Haltemprice &amp; Howden) tried for a while to catch the Speaker’s eye but after a while he left the Chamber.</p><div class="item">

It came when pleasingly plump-tummied Sir Oliver Heald (Con, NE Herts) picked up on Mr Corbyn’s allegation that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab had been sent to Brussels amid ‘chaos’ at the weekend and that he had returned ‘with his tail between his legs’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sir Oliver gave a buttery little chuckle – it contained enough cream for ducklings to have paddled in it. He hoped Mr Raab would be sent over to the Continent ‘as often as possible’ provided he secured a decent agreement with the Europeans.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was hardly a wisecrack at all but it was said with a generosity of spirit that had until that moment been absent. It thus helped pop some of the nastiness in the air.</p><img id="i-d040eb1de09266f8" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/15/22/5073924-6279143-image-a-31_1539638089491.jpg" height="223" width="306" alt="Testy: Jeremy Corbyn and his Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer yesterday" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the Labour backbenches, meanwhile, Chuka Umunna (Streatham) was a portrait of tragedy. Blowing bubbles. Owen Paterson (Con, N Shropshire) had a good point: what exactly is the EU’s problem with letting Irish customs checks be done using new technology.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May muttered something about how any new warehouses could possibly be attacked. It was not wildly convincing. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley, on the front bench, looked unhappy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable had the day’s other good question: er, why was Mrs May making a Statement, given that she had nothing new to report? Sir Vince was belaboured from all sides for asking this. Such is his fate in a Chamber where he has so few MPs and where Speaker Bercow seems to care little for him. Mrs May was not much amused by the question. She is not much amused by anything. But Sir Vince had a point.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The sole function of Mrs May’s appearance was to show that she was still at the helm. Not dead yet.</p><div class="item">

Last December, both sides agreed there should be a ‘backstop’ or fall-back agreement to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the South, and to protect the Good Friday Agreement. Theresa May told the House yesterday there had been ‘real progress’ in the talks in recent weeks but on the backstop the two sides appear as far apart as ever.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What does the European Union want?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The EU has argued that the backstop must be specific to Northern Ireland, which would stay in the EU’s customs union and parts of the single market, while Great Britain went its own way. This would apply from the end of the transition period at the end of 2020 until the point at which a whole UK-EU trading arrangement is struck.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What does No 10 want?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May has proposed a backstop which applies to the whole of the UK. Until a future trading arrangement was agreed, both Great Britain and Northern Ireland would stay within certain elements of the EU’s customs arrangements. Mrs May stressed this would be for a temporary period and not a ‘permanent limbo’, although there will be no specific date contained within the Withdrawal Agreement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What happened on Sunday?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The EU demanded a ‘backstop to the backstop’. While agreeing that in principle the UK-wide backstop could apply, Brussels said there was not time to agree all the details in time to sign the Withdrawal Agreement. As a result, they said, their original proposal of a Northern Ireland-only solution should also be in place. In truth, they just reverted to their original position, and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab pulled the plug on the talks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Why won’t Theresa May agree to the EU’s demands?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An avowed unionist, Mrs May has insisted anything which ‘threatens the integrity of the UK’ will not fly, and that includes customs checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. Parliament has also voted, in the Trade Bill, to ban Northern Ireland becoming part of a separate customs territory to the rest of the UK. The Democratic Unionist Party, on whom Mrs May relies for her majority, have said customs and regulatory checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain are a ‘blood-red line’ and even threatened to vote down the Budget if they think the Prime Minister is making too many compromises.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What happens next?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May travels to Brussels on Wednesday afternoon for dinner with the other 27 member states, in a last-ditch attempt to hammer out a deal that she – and Parliament – is prepared to swallow. If the two sides cannot bridge the gap, they’re heading for no deal.</p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>PM says she will never leave the UK tied to EU's trade rules</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>By Jason Groves and David Churchill </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Theresa May last night vowed she will never sign a Brexit deal that would consign Britain to ‘permanent limbo’ in the EU’s customs union.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Prime Minister, who faces a potential Cabinet revolt over the issue today, refused eight times to say whether a ‘temporary’ customs plan would contain a firm end date.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But she told the Commons she accepted the need for some form of exit mechanism or ‘break clause’, saying: ‘People are rightly concerned that what is only meant to be temporary could become a permanent limbo, with no new relationship between the UK and EU ever agreed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I am clear we are not going to be trapped permanently in a single customs territory unable to do meaningful trade deals.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Negotiations with Brussels hit the rocks on Sunday after Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab rejected EU proposals for resolving the Irish border issue at a ‘frank’ meeting with his EU counterpart Michel Barnier.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May insisted hopes for a deal were still alive, saying the two sides were not ‘far apart’. Tomorrow, she will address fellow EU leaders at a crunch summit in Brussels in a bid to break the deadlock.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But EU president Donald Tusk said a no-deal Brexit was now ‘more likely than ever before’. And EU leaders suggested the timetable for any deal was slipping.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One Cabinet minister last night said Mrs May was engaged in a ‘game of chicken’ with the EU, adding ‘The chances of a no-deal have gone up considerably.’ It came as:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The breakdown in talks centres on the so-called ‘backstop’ plans designed to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May revealed for the first time that the EU has agreed to consider her plan to keep the whole UK in a ‘temporary customs arrangement’ if a backstop is needed. But she told MPs that Brussels had also demanded a ‘backstop to the backstop’, which would ultimately require Northern Ireland to remain in the customs union – an idea Mrs May said was unacceptable. She insisted that a deal was still ‘achievable’, but government sources played down hopes of a breakthrough this week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She voiced her ‘frustration’ that the Irish issue was holding up talks, but added: ‘We are entering the final stages of these negotiations. This is the time for cool, calm heads to prevail.’</p><img id="i-60654a1da88ad3b6" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/15/21/5072554-6279143-image-a-22_1539635465753.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Negotiations with Brussels hit the rocks on Sunday after Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab rejected EU proposals for resolving the Irish border issue at a ¿frank¿ meeting with his EU counterpart Michel Barnier" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eurosceptic MPs accused No 10 of manufacturing a ‘confected row’ to distract attention from a potential sellout. Former Brexit minister Steve Baker said the breakdown in talks was ‘almost certainly theatre’. Fellow Tory Sir Bernard Jenkin added: ‘Of course this is a confected row which will be resolved to overshadow the unacceptable nature of the rest of the deal.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eurosceptic MPs also urged ministers to force Mrs May to change tack. Former minister Mark Francois, a leading member of the European Research Group, said: ‘We believe the Cabinet should do what they have not done at all, which is debate the merits of a super-Canada trade deal. I think they will find it is superior to Chequers.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Mrs May told MPs that a Canada-style deal was on offer only if the UK was willing to see Northern Ireland ‘carved out’ into a permanent customs union with the EU – something she would never contemplate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One senior EU diplomat said: ‘Mrs May didn’t sound too pessimistic and I think we’re close, but we still need some time.’ </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Theresa May wore a white coat yesterday afternoon for yet another Commons Statement on Brexit.

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Treacherously, he accuses the PM of ‘incipient panic’ under pressure from Brussels and has called for a full-scale Cabinet revolt against her over what he portentously calls ‘one of the most fundamental decisions that government has taken in modern times’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For good measure, he adds: ‘This week the authority of our constitution is on the line.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is high-blown claptrap.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In truth, what we are witnessing is not the British constitution under threat but one of the oldest and most familiar stories in politics: An old man in a hurry.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I know Mr Davis (who’ll be 70 in December) very well. He is a thoroughly decent man and an ornament to the House of Commons.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unlike most MPs, he’s had experience of real life outside politics, both as a director of sugar giant Tate &amp; Lyle where he worked for 17 years and as an infantryman in the territorial SAS. And unlike many Tory MPs, he’s had to make his own way in life, being brought up by a single mother and spending his early years mainly on a council estate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He’s been touted as a possible future Tory leader ever since he was first elected MP when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister in 1987. Indeed, he stood as a leadership candidate 13 years ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But for all his many qualities, he lacks the record of substantial achievement in politics that is essential for someone with his experience who seeks the top job.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, Mr Davis is chiefly notable for his record of resignations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To misquote Oscar Wilde: ‘One ministerial resignation may be regarded as a misfortune; two looks like carelessness.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">True, Mr Davis’s two resignations have always been on points of principle – but there have, nevertheless, been too many.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The most baffling occurred ten years ago when he was shadow home secretary – causing embarrassment to his boss David Cameron when he was leader of the opposition. He stepped down to fight a by-election over his anger over the then Labour government’s plans for 42-day pre-charge detention as part of its anti-terror policy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Davis’s most recent resignation was in the summer, in protest against Mrs May’s so-called Chequers plan for Brexit. His strop made headlines for a few days.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But as Brexit secretary he should never have allowed Mrs May to have got boxed into such a tight corner by Brussels’ Brexit negotiators.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He had originally been given the job by her in recognition of his role as one of the few Tory big-hitters who had campaigned for Brexit during the 2016 referendum campaign.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Suddenly, he was offered his chance to earn a place in history and put his own imprimatur on Britain’s departure from the EU.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m afraid to say he failed. Most shamefully, not only was he repulsed by Michel Barnier &amp; Co but he was weakly shoved aside by his own pro-Remain civil servants.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Equally heinous, Mr Davis gave the impression of failing to master his brief.

Russia had huge business interests with Gaddafi’s Libya and lost around $10 billion in oil and other contracts – including $3 billion for a railway project and a $4 billion arms deal – when he was deposed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Part of Putin’s drive is his continuing fury at the Western military intervention that brought chaos to the Middle East and damaged Russian interests in the process.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today, the Russian President is conspicuously helping stick the pieces back together.

That is not, presumably, how the Russian President thinks regional strong men should be treated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Above all else, however, Putin is an opportunist. He seeks not just the lifting of sanctions against his country, but the continued destabilisation of Europe, which is why he has so avidly supported its separatist and nationalist parties. It remains a hugely successful tactic. The West, meanwhile, after years of diplomatic ineptitude and catastrophically wrong-headed intervention, seems unable to muster a response.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Should we co-operate with Russia and with other world powers to rebuild the shattered Libyan state?

Strutting the opposite way down the pavement came a young brunette lady, with her earphones in and nose in the air.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">T O MY horror, it was the frail gentleman who ended up being the one forced to move aside.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">David Davis is running. Literally. ‘It’s his 70th birthday in December,’ a friend reveals, ‘and he’s going to celebrate it by doing a marathon.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He will not be exercising for his health. The former Secretary of State for Exiting the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/european-union/index.html" id="mol-3fd4af00-cf4b-11e8-9081-4f0949ccd910">European Union</a> is sending a less than subtle political signal: ‘I’m still young and fit enough to lead.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This weekend, Westminster is again rolling and pitching with rumour. At least four Cabinet Ministers are said to be on ‘resignation watch’. Half a dozen more are in semi-private revolt over the Prime Minister’s <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/brexit/index.html" id="mol-3fd412c0-cf4b-11e8-9081-4f0949ccd910" class="class">Brexit</a> strategy.</p><img id="i-8382758d6d866324" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/14/01/5029148-0-image-a-37_1539477768703.jpg" height="459" width="634" alt="Prime Minister Theresa May is bracing herself for a further round of ministerial resignations with four members of her team reportedly ready to abandon ship" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Reports suggest an ambush of the Budget and other key planks of the Government’s flimsy domestic agenda are being planned.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the whispering about a leadership challenge has risen to an audible rumble. We have been here before, of course. Theresa May’s premiership has been the subject of more premature death notices than Mark Twain. But this really is different. As one Minister put it: ‘This time she is testing the Cabinet’s loyalty to destruction.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Much of the political narrative of the summer has centred on a tortuous debate over if, and when, a Conservative Party leadership contest will commence. But the truth is one is already under way. Albeit currently with only two candidates.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Freed from the constraints of office, Boris Johnson and David Davis are locked in a duel for the crown. ‘David was reluctant initially,’ says a Tory backbencher. ‘If the party came and knocked on his door, he’d accept. But he’s realised the stakes are too high to just sit around and wait for people to come cap in hand to him.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Davis has begun overtly courting his colleagues. His campaign team are now confident he has overtaken Johnson as the Brexiteers’ candidate of choice. ‘People realise Boris can’t win now. There’s no way he can get through the parliamentary party,’ says a Davis ally.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They cite numerous reasons for this rapid ascent. One is the backlash from colleagues to Boris’s attempt to bypass Tory MPs. In a strategy reminiscent of Jeremy Corbyn’s use of Momentum to boost his candidature, Johnson and his team are encouraging Tory activists to pressure their MPs to place his name on the ballot. ‘Boris is basically trying to bully his way on to the shortlist,’ says a back-bencher, ‘and it’s backfiring on him.’</p><img id="i-7536aaee8aa4bb05" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/14/01/5029178-0-image-a-45_1539477879936.jpg" height="400" width="634" alt="Boris Johnson and David Davis are both involved in a battle to replace Mrs May after she is eventually deposed by the Conservative Party " class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">They also claim Davis’s impeccable Brexit credentials – friends point out he needed to write no angst-ridden articles weighing the pros and cons of Britain’s EU departure – and working-class-boy- made-good biography give him the edge over his flamboyant but entitled rival. And there is some evidence to support this thesis. ‘If David pitches himself as the caretaker to see us through Brexit, I would support that,’ says a leading member of the influential European Reform Group.</p><img id="i-73bd706e2a97ecc7" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/14/08/5029316-6273667-David_Davis_could_find_his_way_in_Number_10_if_he_promises_to_be-a-1_1539500489189.jpg" height="460" width="306" alt="David Davis could find his way in Number 10 if he promises to be a caretaker PM who nurses through Brexit " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it is not just Boris who is viewing the Davis ascendency with mounting concern. Downing Street is obviously alarmed. Even more significantly, so is the rest of the Cabinet. Although the conference was seen as a success for the Prime Minister, it was a fraught and frustrating experience for many of her senior colleagues. Demands for overt expressions of Cabinet loyalty were coupled with an insistence that all speeches be vetted by No 10. ‘The dead hand came down hard,’ according to one Minister.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having spent the post-Chequers period propping up Mrs May, a number of Cabinet Ministers are starting to worry they have become lashed to her like mountaineers on an increasingly suicidal ascent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As one puts it: ‘We’ve understood we have to try to stick together. But the danger now is she’s going to go over the edge, and instead of saving her, we’re just going to go down with her.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Given the enormity of the moment the Brexit negotiations represent, this may seem a case of personal ambition overtaking the national interest. But the core members of Mrs May’s Cabinet are facing a more complex dilemma.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most senior Ministers have reconciled themselves to potentially having to sacrifice their careers to get Brexit through. But what is bringing them to the brink of rebellion is the thought that they are being asked to sacrifice themselves for a Brexit strategy that is ultimately doomed. And even more damningly, that the Prime Minister is not even entertaining any alternative to Chequers. ‘She’s not engaging,’ one complained, ‘she sat at Cabinet this week and just read from a script.’</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS debate" data-version="2" id="mol-b842fc00-cf49-11e8-9081-4f0949ccd910">                                                        <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">While No10 braces for a round of possible Brexit resignations, officials have been quietly gaming out replacements. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m told Victoria Atkins, Rishi Sunak and Kit Malthouse are three Ministers who have caught the PM’s eye. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don’t leave the phone on silent this week, guys.</p></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Specifically, Ministers are angered at two separate issues. Firstly, that Downing Street has failed to agree to an end-date to any continuing ‘transitional’ membership of the customs union. And secondly, there is no planning for a looser, free-trade style Canada option in the event that Chequers is rejected.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No 10’s line is that Mrs May would never agree to a deal that would permanently trap the UK in a customs union back-stop. But they stop short of naming the all-important end-date. And they insist Chequers is the only plan on the table that respects the will of the British people and safeguards the unity of the UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is not what Mrs May’s Ministers want to hear. ‘We understand that, to get this through, we’re going to have to swallow a lot,’ says one, ‘but if I’m being honest, if you put Chequers on the table and Canada on the table, and asked me to pick one, I’d go for Canada. And so would just about everyone else.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Until now the Prime Minister has managed to hold her Cabinet together. Or, as her Ministers would frame it, their own self-discipline – in the face of significant internal and external provocation – has just about managed to keep the Government and its Brexit strategy on the rails. But this morning that self-discipline is close to fracturing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Theresa May has pushed her colleagues’ loyalty to the brink before. But this time she may have pushed them too far.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Cameron's mighty Brexit clanger</strong></p><img id="i-39967abcc6be325" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/14/01/5029172-0-image-a-49_1539478064782.jpg" height="447" width="306" alt="Former PM David Cameron thought he would never have to hold the Brexit referendum as he believed the Lib Dems would still be in coalition " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">As the withdrawal negotiations careen towards their denouement, I understand former Coalition Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander has been revealing to friends how the great Brexit adventure was never actually supposed to see the light of day. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I was chatting to him the other day,’ explains an acquaintance, ‘and he told me about a dinner he attended in Downing Street with Nick Clegg, George Osborne and David Cameron. Danny, Nick and George all told David that on no circumstances should he go for a referendum, but David just waved their concerns away. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He thought it wouldn’t matter, because after the Election there would be another coalition, and the Lib Dems could just block a referendum as the price of a new deal.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The best laid plans… </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Quotes of the week</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>‘That was a short flight.’</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Astronaut Alexey Ovchinin</strong> jokes after he was forced to abort a space trip just seconds after take-off and endure a terrifying landing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>‘You xnd your collxborxtors clxxrly hxvx too much timx on your hands.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just as modish elite opinion swings ever more swiftly towards legalising marijuana, shocking and undeniable new evidence of its grave and frightening harms comes to light. Which will win? Fashion, and the prejudice of the chattering class? Or common sense?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The truth about this very dangerous and far-from-soft drug can no longer be hidden. As The Mail on Sunday reveals today, there have been more than 125,000 hospital admissions related to cannabis or similar drugs in the past five years. These are concentrated among the young. Just how ill did the users of this supposedly harmless drug have to be, for them to end up in hospital casualty departments? How many others suffered panic and misery alone and untreated?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet this country faces a grim race, between a fanatical and sometimes greedy campaign to decriminalise marijuana at all costs, and the accumulating evidence that such a move would be an irreparable disaster.</p><img id="i-d6a633483874c93e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/14/00/5024338-6273159-image-a-27_1539474123826.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="This country faces a grim race, between a fanatical and sometimes greedy campaign to decriminalise marijuana at all costs, and the accumulating evidence that such a move would be an irreparable disaster" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">For years, the billionaire-backed proponents of a cannabis free-for-all have sneered at warnings offered by me and many others that the drug is a major danger to mental health. Where was the proof of the damage it did, they would ask, ignoring the tragic evidence in every town centre of homeless, shattered, trembling men and women, plainly broken by drug abuse. These wicked cynics have, I believe, known all along that many individuals and families would pay a high and painful price for their pleasure, wealth and convenience.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In much the same way, Big Tobacco knew for years that cigarettes were doing terrible damage to smokers, but carried on making millions from them and resisted attempts to restrict advertising and sales.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The marijuana lobby, who I call Big Dope, are equally ready to overlook the horror of irreversible mental illness, for what some of them see as a good cause, and others see as a pot of gold.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At a debate on the subject at Durham University on Monday, in which I opposed decriminalisation, supporters of drug legalisation openly conceded that marijuana does damage the mental health of some of its users.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it seems they don’t really care. They have dismissed as ‘anecdotal’ hundreds of individual stories in which the link between the drug and mental illness has been startling. Psychiatrists have little doubt. Dr Humphrey Needham-Bennett, medical director and consultant psychiatrist of the Cygnet Hospital in Sevenoaks, Kent, says that among his patients ‘cannabis use is so common that I assume that people use or used it. It’s quite surprising when people say, “No, I don’t use drugs.” ’ Even then, they may not be telling the truth. Other psychiatrists report that cannabis use is now so common among the young that many who smoke it do not even regard it as a drug.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet, until very recently, there was hardly any research into the link, and when it took place, in a Swedish Army survey that showed a clear connection, it was ignored.</p><div class="item">

He said he was ‘amazed to discover how many friends had a relative disabled by schizophrenia. The common feature in these tragedies was that the victim had taken cannabis in significant quantities at a young age.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So why did these facts have so little impact? As Patrick puts it ‘supporters of decriminalisation in the media and among the intelligentsia see cannabis as harmless and discount opposition to it as ill-informed prejudice’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Patrick is too kind. In fact, an enormous, wealthy and powerful lobby wants marijuana laws liberalised at almost any cost, and will, if it is not stopped, force its views on this country very soon.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some of these campaigners are guided by a weird and twisted idealism. They genuinely believe that a society in which we are free to drug ourselves into a stupor will be better than the self-disciplined, self-restrained sobriety of the past.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Such ‘libertarians’ are headed by the Hungarian multi-billionaire George Soros, whose Open Society Foundations contributed $200 million (£151 million) to campaigns in the USA and around the world to liberalise drug laws between 1994 and 2014. Much of his money is channelled through a body called the Drug Policy Alliance. But he is far from alone, according to Forbes Magazine. Many mega-rich Americans have also contributed large piles of dollars to such campaigns, for example the recent ‘Proposition 64’ ballot which legalised marijuana – including advertising of the drug – in California.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But these forces are not confined to the USA. The social-media multi-millionaire Paul Birch similarly backs a utopian British campaign for drug liberalisation called Volteface, whose advisory board includes such grand figures as Fiona Measham, Professor of Criminology at Durham University.</p><div class="item">

As long ago as 1973, they won a huge victory when the Tory government told magistrates to stop sending anyone to prison for cannabis possession" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is also adorned by the veteran campaigner Mike Trace. Mr Trace, who was once ‘Deputy Drug Tsar’ for the Blair government, resigned from a key United Nations drug post in January 2003 after leaked documents showed he had privately described himself as a ‘fifth column’ for liberalisation, despite having been hired to reduce demand for drugs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps most interesting of all of those on the Volteface advisory board is Brendan Kennedy, described as the ‘CEO (Chief Executive Officer) of Privateer Holdings and President of Tilray and Leafly’. Leafly is the world’s largest cannabis website. Tilray is a Canadian marijuana company. It is owned by Privateer Holdings, a private equity firm whose other companies sell cannabis products for legal recreational use in America. Privateer Holdings helped pay for a visit to Seattle for Tory MP and former Minister Crispin Blunt, an increasingly noisy campaigner for drug liberalisation. Parliament’s register of MPs’ interests says the aim of the journey was ‘to understand the regulatory, licensing and economic issues around the cannabis industry in Washington State’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tilray, meanwhile, is booming, perhaps because of Canada’s recent decision to legalise marijuana, or perhaps because of the USA’s plans to import Canadian-grown marijuana for ‘medical’ use. In July, Tilray became the first marijuana company to be publicly listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in New York. Its shares at first doubled from $17 to $35, now stands at $148. The company was recently said to be worth over $20 billion – more than American Airlines.</p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">This is just part of a frenzy of mainstream investor interest in cannabis companies – an interest also raging in London where investors recently gathered in a St James’s hotel to discuss the large potential profits of ‘medical’ marijuana.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is a savage irony here. While campaigners for legalisation claim marijuana is a medicine, growing numbers of its users, and their families, are learning that it is a major public health scourge. Clever public relations men have in recent months managed to tear at the nation’s heartstrings with stories of sick children supposedly helped by marijuana products, and their noble mothers being frustrated by a cruel government. It might be – though proof is hard to find – that some of the ingredients of cannabis may be helpful in such cases. But there has been a close link, not least through Volteface and similar groups, between these touching stories and a much wider campaign for much less touching aim – general legalisation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no real connection between these sad cases and legalisation. But the liberalisers want you to think there is. This is really a public-relations campaign, to change, smooth and polish the image of a drug once rightly associated with dropouts, squalor, crime and lax morals. As the veteran American campaigner for legalisation Keith Stroup said in an unguarded moment in 1979 (he has since very much regretted being so frank): ‘We are trying to get marijuana reclassified medically. If we do that… we’ll be using the issue as a red herring to give marijuana a good name.’ It must be the most successful red herring in history.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Medical cannabis is and always has been a Trojan Horse for general legalisation, aimed at bypassing our heads and wringing our hearts. Despite false claims that the British Government has obstructed attempts to use marijuana as a medicine, it has repeatedly licensed experiments to see if it is any use. There is now a legal cannabis farm at a secret location in Kent, where the plant can be grown for medical experimentation. The trouble is, nobody has yet found any really convincing medical use for its main psychoactive ingredient, THC.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It all goes back to the 1960s, when the universities of Western nations became the scene of a mass rebellion against the marijuana laws, a rebellion winked at by the authorities. When I was at the University of York in the early 1970s, then one of the new ‘plate glass’ universities, cannabis smoking was almost universal. People said at the time that I and my contemporary Harriet Harman were the only people on campus who did not smoke dope, and they were probably not far wrong. The future elite of Britain – lawyers, politicians, civil servants, police officers, novelists, broadcasters, teachers, journalists – were all sprawled on the sunny lawns of such campuses, engaging in the Holy Communion of the 1960s rebellion, the shared joint.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And when they went on into adult life, many of them continued to use it, or at least still feel sentimental about it. Others, a shocking number, including some very prominent people whose identities are known to me, allowed their own children to take drugs at home, and became scared that they might face prosecution and career damage. Such people are very powerful indeed in the media. This is especially so in the BBC, which for some years has denied a fair platform to the case against legalisation, and is shamelessly biased towards the liberalisers. But it is also true in more than one supposedly conservative newspaper.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since the 1960s, often backed by big money, the cannabis generation have campaigned to weaken the law. As long ago as 1973, they won a huge victory when the Tory government told magistrates to stop sending anyone to prison for cannabis possession. Bit by bit, police forces – first secretly, then openly – gave up bothering to arrest or charge offenders.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And so, for millions of law-abiding people, the stink of the cannabis weed lingers in their streets, drifts into their back gardens from neighbours’ homes, permeates the playgrounds of their children’s schools, pollutes the air of parks and can even be sniffed on buses and trains.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don’t bother calling the police. They are not interested. They might make the occasional propaganda raid on dealers, for the cameras. But users are hardly ever bothered unless they are scooped up in an arrest for another crime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is not a private, victimless crime. Mental illness is a tragedy and a lifelong disaster for the families of those affected. Thousands of careers are blighted by the damage that marijuana does to the intelligence of the young people who use it. Many teachers know only too well the sad and weary signs that a star pupil has started smoking dope, and begun to slide to the bottom of the class, where he will stay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And there are other more frightening implications. A worrying number of ultra-violent crimes, including terrorist crimes, are committed by long-term marijuana users – the killers of Lee Rigby being an especially good example. Drug-maddened drivers are a growing danger. A talented young doctor, Alex Boorman, would still be alive if he had not encountered the cannabis user Jake Rogers on a road near York. Rogers was high on marijuana and overtaking at 87mph on a blind bend in December 2017. His criminal stupidity was bound to bring death or serious injury to someone. This was a particularly spectacular case, and the doctor, riding his motorbike, lacked the protection of airbags and seatbelts which nowadays leaves so many crash victims alive but seriously injured.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How many others go unrecorded? How many more will there be if we heed last week’s bizarre shift by the Royal College of Psychiatrists (who of all people should know better) towards a liberal view?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Big Dope lobby tell us that, in some magical way, legal cannabis will be safer. It will not. Legal alcohol and legal tobacco are not safe. Their users still get cirrhosis, cancer, heart disease and emphysema. And, once marijuana is legal, available in shops and on the internet, and advertised (as Big Dope desires) many more people will take it, so greatly increasing the number of possible victims. It is so obvious it hardly needs saying.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then we are told that ‘regulation’ will limit the strength of the marijuana on sale. Really? First of all, legal alcohol has steadily grown stronger in the past few decades. Both wine and beer are now startlingly stronger than they used to be. As drinkers seek out the stronger brands, many drug abusers actively like and seek the strong strains of cannabis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And if such strains are banned in legal shops, the illegal traders will always be ready to supply them, free of tax. So the legal traders will lobby to be allowed to sell the stronger drugs. This is more or less what has happened in the US state of Colorado, where legalisation, followed by taxation, has not ended the illegal trade at all. The criminal gangs continue to operate, alongside the slick cynical businessmen who have moved in to the market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And at the end of this week, on October 17, the whole of Canada will be subject to a similar crazy experiment, as legal marijuana goes on sale throughout that vast country. I have no doubt that it will end in tears, and worse than tears. But will the poor Canadians ever be able to reverse it once it has gone wrong, and the terrible price is evident? History suggests not. It is very hard indeed to bring back a legal ban on a drug that has been legal and in mass use.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, in those wisely run and free, law-governed countries, Japan and South Korea, police continue to enforce laws against cannabis possession as we once did, and drug use and its attendant tragedies is far, far lower.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That must be the answer we give to those who would legalise this poison here. Even if their plan is a disastrous mistake, it will be incredibly hard to put right.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let us wait and watch, for several careful and suspicious years, to see how their scheme actually works in practice. Let us also study what happens in Japan and South Korea, and see how they are getting on. And then let us have the honest debate we really need, in the full light of the day, without the lobbyists’ tricks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>This country faces a grim race, between a fanatical and sometimes greedy campaign to decriminalise marijuana at all costs, and the accumulating evidence that such a move would be an irreparable disaster.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Peter Hitchens for The Mail on Sunday</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-14T06:13:02.000+02:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>PETER HITCHINS: On the elites hellbent on legalising marijuana</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-14T06:13:02.000+02:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/14/00/5024338-0-image-a-20_1539474566648.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1000161</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>AFP/Getty Images</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6273557/Lawnmower-mothers-grown-children-mow-obstacle-path.html" title="March of the Lawnmower Mums: Meet the mothers of grown up children who will mow down any obstacle in their path - but isn't it time the little darlings fended for themselves? "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6270633/SodaStream-ramps-bid-clean-worlds-dirtiest-beaches.html" title="SodaStream's Plastic Fighters: Drinks giant ramps up bid to clean the world's dirtiest beaches with the 'Holy Turtle' that sucks litter out of the sea"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6273525/Just-SEVEN-calories-day-takes-fat.html" title="Just SEVEN calories too many a day 'is all it takes to get fat' - the equivalent of one sachet of ketchup "></link></item><item><title>Is a crash coming?

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The British economy today resembles a clown on a unicycle, wobbling across Niagara Falls in a high wind on a tightrope, carrying a tottering burden of dead refrigerators, umbrellas, saucepans and budgerigar cages.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is amazing that it does not tumble into the abyss, amid clattering noises and shouts of dismay. Each morning I wake up and the cashpoint machines are still working, I mutter my thanks that we have lasted a little longer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am not sure who I am thanking. I think it doesn’t crash because everyone who understands the position is quietly hoping that something will turn up to save it. But what if nothing turns up? Are we remotely ready to cope?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her Majesty the Queen famously asked after the 2008 crash why nobody saw it coming. Almost anyone, even me, can see the next one coming.</p><img id="i-452ba3c2820d80fb" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/14/00/02C12D78000004B0-6273513-The_British_economy_today_resembles_a_clown_on_a_unicycle_wobbli-m-15_1539473763964.jpg" height="402" width="634" alt="The British economy today resembles a clown on a unicycle, wobbling across Niagara Falls in a high wind on a tightrope.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The International Monetary Fund pointed out on Wednesday that Britain’s liabilities, from unpayable debts to gigantic public sector pension commitments, outweigh its assets by five trillion pounds to three trillion pounds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is to say, if they called in the bailiffs, and sold everything we have, we would still be two trillion pounds short.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is partly because the British State has sold off so many of its assets already, so that your water supply is now owned by a foreign bank, and your privatised train is run by a foreign nationalised railway system. Presumably there’s some sense in this somewhere, though I can’t see what it is. At this rate, my local police force will end up being owned by the Kremlin and controlled by the GRU. And frankly, I’d be amazed if they do a worse job than the current management.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This sort of wild crisis level of debt can just about be tolerated in wartime, but I do not think we have suffered it in peacetime before. I don’t think it even includes the slopping ocean of private borrowing, which for most people is the only way they can afford the standard of living they were once used to, but now can’t afford on their shrinking pay. We are, in every way, a lot worse off than we were when the last crisis hit us in 2008.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But here’s one cause for comfort. The IMF praise us for at least being more honest than some countries about how bad things are. That’s nice. But it doesn’t really help.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My problem is that I can actually imagine it going wrong, all too easily. In 1990s Moscow, I saw repeated waves of catastrophe striking Russia’s middle classes, their savings wiped out, their welfare state, such as it was, shrivelling to nothing, their pensions evaporating. It was awful. People had to sell their belongings on the street to buy food.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Russians are very tough, and they survived, as they still do, as ghosts of their former selves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let us hope it does not come to that, and the wobbling clown makes his way safely to the other side, against all the odds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the meantime, in between the crisis and the catastrophe, we may as well have a glass of champagne.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Haunted by the memory of the Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko, who helped fake his own death in Kiev with the aid of the Ukrainian authorities and a lot of pig’s blood, I feel I must be cautious about the disappearance of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would be a great relief if Mr Khashoggi were to turn up alive and well, amid embarrassed explanations. But it is looking like an increasingly faint hope.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What should we in Britain make of this, if it turns out to be as bad as it looks? Sadly, we cannot say or do much. Even if we do eventually condemn the Saudis, we will do so with obvious reluctance, and will try as hard as we can to avoid a total breach. I’ll be more than surprised if we impose any serious sanctions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This country has been living in the pocket of the Saudi despotism for decades. Our crazy policy in Syria, of supporting jihadis we would lock up if we found them in Birmingham, was adopted to please the Saudis. We are more or less silent about their police state repressions. We swallow our revulsion at the cruel little war they are conducting in Yemen, and side with them in their wild sectarian confrontation with Iran.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our Royal Family is ceaselessly forced to pay court to the rulers of Riyadh. Flags in London fly at half-mast if a Saudi king dies. At least two recent British premiers have had to do obeisance to these tyrants as they were invested with some sort of ‘honour’.</p><img id="i-c8d7f0488b50f8e8" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/14/00/06263554000007D0-6273513-image-a-12_1539473631183.jpg" height="404" width="634" alt="Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi arriving at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">David Cameron was awarded the Order of Abdulaziz al Saud in 2012 for ‘meritorious service to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’. Theresa May got hers in 2017.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I understand exactly why we do this. Britain is no longer a great and rich imperial power and must do undignified things to keep its citizens in work.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is worth a few humiliations, and having to be polite to people you don’t really like.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Personally, I think we take it too far when we get involved in violent, futile and dangerous nonsenses like the Syrian war.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, in any case, we need to tone down our moral bloviation when other countries misbehave. For some years now, the British Government has squawked about the undoubted wickedness of Russia. I have always said this outrage was phoney, because it is selective and is not aimed at lots of other countries we are afraid of, or owe money to.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thanks to the Khashoggi incident, all kinds of other people who had never noticed this hypocrisy have now done so, and so it will have some effect.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The clock is counting down to next week’s crunch EU summit in Brussels, which, in the view of many, is D-Day for <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/brexit/index.html" id="mol-df828e00-ce79-11e8-ad95-21669d5c7d95">Brexit</a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, we are not due to leave the EU until next March, but if we are to avoid a serious crisis of confidence and financial jitters between now and then, industry wants to see the politicians agree some sort of framework deal by the end of the month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A year and seven months after Mrs May triggered Article 50 and began the EU exit process, we really do find ourselves at a crucial juncture. </p><img id="i-6dbd654a1492b290" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/13/00/5009460-0-image-a-13_1539387990616.jpg" height="453" width="634" alt="Prime Minister Theresa May triggered Article 50 a whole year and seven months ago, in preparation to leave the bloc in March 2019 [File photo]" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">We can (and probably will) go on haggling about the final exit terms for years, but business needs to know the boundaries pronto.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Theresa May’s Chequers deal may invoke scorn from both ends of the Brexit spectrum but, in the eyes of German industry, it is a basis for negotiation. It also involves a just-about-swallowable answer to the problem of the Irish border. To many European businesses, it’s at least a start.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet EU hardliners such as Macron and the arch-federalists in Brussels keep throwing it back in her face. Why? Because some, like Macron, beset by plummeting popularity ratings, want to show their home audience that they are tough on the treacherous Brits.</p><img id="i-fec2d1e06a6b5386" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/13/00/5009502-0-image-a-2_1539386791744.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="French President Emmanuel Macron, above, has suggested politicians who backed leave were 'liars' at last month's EU summit [File photo]" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">It is also because they are deploying a dangerous strategy: the tougher the deal, the more likely (so the theory goes) that Britain will be pushed into holding a second referendum. And if that doesn’t lead to a second vote, it will certainly terrify any other country with the nerve to consider leaving the grand projet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The knuckleduster approach may play well in Brussels and pander to the sort of Remainer zealots who want Brexit to be a total disaster so they can gloat amid the wreckage. But how does it go down in Europe, among the people who actually pay for it all?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the answer, I have come to Bavaria. And they are clear that they don’t want Britain dragged outside for a beating. They want common sense.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Germany’s largest state is so prosperous that if it went independent, its GDP (at half a trillion pounds) would put it ahead of most countries in the world. It is the home of global brands including BMW, Audi, Siemens and Adidas.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it is also home to thousands of smaller companies, many of them family businesses, which form the bedrock of the European economy — and which also happen to export billions of pounds worth of goods to Britain every year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are the widget-makers who prop up the German corporate pyramid.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are hard-nosed commercial people, most of whom are fervent believers in the European dream. Yet they are also realists. They believe a no-deal Brexit would be disastrous for the European economy as well as for Britain because of the vast imbalance in trade. In other words, Britain buys much more from them than it sells to them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is why they want Europe’s politicians to cease their posturing, threatening behaviour towards the UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The UK is essential to our business, so I want a deal. The best thing is to find a solution that does not hurt either the UK or the EU. We need to protect the industry of both players,’ says Reinhold Braun, general manager of Sortimo International, a company that makes racks and shelving, employs 1,400 people and sells 20 per cent of its products to the UK.</p><img id="i-dd00ba8d0a601c80" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/13/00/5009538-0-image-a-8_1539386997184.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="A Mercedes Benz factory in Sindelfingen, Germany. Businesses in the country are also worried about the Brexit impact on their industries [File photo]" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He wants German Chancellor Angela Merkel to steer Europe round to a more conciliatory position. ‘It has to happen that Merkel steps in and pushes for a deal. It has to happen,’ says Braun. He adds that the hardline Brexiteers need to give the Prime Minister some leeway, too, as she tries to re-work her Chequers deal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Is Chequers the solution? I don’t know. But it’s there, so personally I’d take it. It is something to work with — and it is getting really late in the day.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is a view echoed by German economists such as Wolfgang Munchau, who writes for the fiercely pro-Remain Financial Times.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Writing in the German business paper Handelsblatt last month, he warned German politicians: ‘Given the political situation in Britain, anyone who continues to call for a hard stance in talks with the British Government doesn’t have Germany’s economic interests at heart or is behaving like turkeys voting for Christmas.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This week, the de facto spokesman for German manufacturing warned that unless Europe cuts a deal with Britain in the next month, there will be ‘disaster’ on both sides of the Channel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We have to pave the way for a well-structured exit of the UK in the next four weeks,’ Joachim Lang, director-general of the German Industry Federation (BDI), declared.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The alternative was a ‘worst-case scenario’ that ‘would put tens of thousands of companies and hundreds of thousands of workers on both sides of the Channel in the greatest difficulties’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Note that he was not calling for a second referendum. Nor, unlike President Macron, was he invoking pious devotion to the sacred European ideals of the single market and the customs union.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To listen to French politicians, things such as the Schengen Agreement and free movement of people are somewhere up there with Thou Shalt Not Kill as an article of faith. Unless you happen to visit, say, the French-Italian border or the German-Austrian border, where border controls are rigidly enforced (especially if you happen to be from an ethnic minority).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What is different now is that the people who actually drive and sustain the European economy are no longer wagging fingers solely at Britain. They are turning their wrath on their own.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lang’s outburst was all the more telling because German business organisations are pretty wary of rocking the boat. They dislike sensational headlines, especially in the naughty British media.</p><img id="i-e7c6ff8b43d7e76a" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/13/00/5009490-0-image-m-4_1539386797394.jpg" height="418" width="634" alt="Industry wants to see the politicians agree some sort of framework deal by the end of the month, including in London [File photo]" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite lodging requests with four separate organisations over the past fortnight, including Mr Lang’s BDI, the German-British Chamber of Commerce and two prominent Bavarian trade associations, I was offered just one company that would talk to me. Then, suddenly, that company found it was too busy after all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So I went knocking on doors instead. And, away from the spin-doctors and the lobby groups, the response was fascinating.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">German businesses have not changed their view on Brexit, of course. They still think it is inexplicable, though they concede that Britain and Germany had very different ambitions right from the outset. Whereas the Brits wanted to join a trading bloc, the Germans think of Europe as a political utopia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But these businesses also accept that we are off and there is no point in punishing us. That is why they favour helping Mrs May rather than siding with all her tormentors.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Take Bernhard Erdl, the founder, president and boss of Puls. ‘I am all for a pragmatic approach, not an idealistic one,’ says Erdl, who started his business in a Munich cellar with one other engineer in 1980. ‘I hope all this talk of punishing Britain is just a bargaining position, not a real position.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His company, a world leader in industrial power control units, employs 1,300 people, 300 of them in Germany. His transformative moment was getting into Asia ahead of his rivals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I work with the Chinese and they are the most pragmatic people I know. In Europe, we talk about dying for our ideas.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The Chinese would never do that. Their main purpose is to keep the country together.’</p><img id="i-2c68dda3709d9ba4" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/13/00/5009442-0-image-a-9_1539387005909.jpg" height="436" width="634" alt="An election campaign poster of the political party 'Alternative fur Deutschland' (AfD) in Munich, Germany. Angela Merkel's CSU party could lose its majority this weekend in the Bavarian State" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">By common consent, the moment has come for Angela Merkel to intervene. British-born engineer Richard Lawrence, who has built up a successful power repair business in Munich and raised his family here, says he has no doubt the German leader will come on board when things get what he calls ‘hypercritical’ in the coming weeks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Right now, it’s all a show. Everyone has to look like they won,’ he says. ‘Merkel is staying out until the last moment. Once BMW start laying off workers, she’ll be in there.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No one is keener on resolving the Brexit impasse than the German car industry. One German job in seven depends on it, and Britain is one of its biggest markets. It is not just that Britain buys so many German cars, but that so many are made in the UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Tobias Nickel is head of corporate communications for Draxlmaier, one of the world’s biggest makers of door panels and wiring harnesses for cars.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Among the company’s major clients is Jaguar Land Rover (JLR). Such is the advanced state of car design now that his company has just three days to build each bespoke panel for every new JLR car, and must then get it from Germany to the British factory within a precise four-hour window.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Miss that slot and you hold up an entire plant, with punitive results. The idea of 30-mile traffic jams at the Channel is the stuff of nightmares. He dreads a ‘no deal’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His company is hardly small, with 70,000 workers worldwide. Yet by German standards it is not big enough to enjoy lobbying access to the German government, unlike the car giants.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So does Dr Nickel not support the EU’s attempts to punish and grind Britain into submission? Does he not support the strong stance of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker?</p><img id="i-48e7b9e1652305e3" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/13/00/5009434-0-image-a-12_1539387055307.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Merkel's 2015 decision to open Germany’s borders to more than a million unchecked migrants has seen the CSU lose substantial ground to the AfD. Above, an AfD street stall in Deggendorf, Bavaria, for this weekend's elections" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Mr Juncker is from Luxembourg, which is a country that does not have a large automotive industry,’ he says carefully. ‘In the automotive industry, we are not in the business of teaching other countries a lesson. We are in the business of making cars.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I get the same no-nonsense message from business all over Europe. Take Claudio Calabresi, who runs his family textile business near Florence, making clothes for M&amp;S, Ted Baker and others. Up to 40 per cent of his £25 million turnover goes to Britain. A bad Brexit would be very grim indeed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As in Germany, he wishes Brexit wasn’t happening. But he is practical, too. He places the blame for the current situation equally on the British and EU politicians and wants calm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It is a very confusing situation. From my point of view, the people shouldn’t be punished,’ he says. ‘We must respect the decision — it has come from the people, not the politicians. In fact, there is a feeling in Italy that if we could take a similar decision, many might go the same way.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Normandy, meanwhile, political and business leaders have warned President Macron that a no-deal Brexit would threaten the region’s economy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Herve Morin, the chairman of the regional council, wrote a public letter this week signed by ten other prominent figures in Normandy, including port and ferry operators, to demand financial help should the negotiations end without a deal. ‘A Brexit without an agreement... represents for our economy, and especially for the economy of our ports, a major threat,’ they wrote.</p><img id="i-2d9941dcfd0e81f8" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/13/00/5009484-0-image-a-11_1539387029489.jpg" height="427" width="634" alt="European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker appeared to mock Theresa May when he performed a little dance while preparing to give a speech in Brussels earlier this month" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back in Bavaria, I do meet some who feel that Britain deserves all it gets. But they are in a minority. Most would like to see Angela Merkel assert more authority over her EU counterparts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After last year’s dismal performance in the general election, there is a sense that she has regained some authority at home. In Europe, she is certainly still queen bee.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But her standing at home may depend on this weekend’s state election here in Bavaria. For years it has been the stronghold of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian wing of her party.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet her 2015 decision to open Germany’s borders to more than a million unchecked migrants has seen the CSU lose substantial ground to the far-Right AfD and it is on course for its worst result in living memory.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I meet one of the anti-migrant AfD candidates, Uli Henkel, in the Munich pub that is now his headquarters. ‘It’s my ninth bar,’ he says, explaining that protesters have driven his campaign HQ out of the previous eight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He cannot envisage Germany ever leaving the EU, but blames Brussels for Brexit. ‘Europe should have done everything to keep the Brits in but it didn’t,’ he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At which point two policemen come into the pub. The AfD’s toxic, anti-Islamic message has led to car burnings, broken windows and regular protests. The cops are here to keep the peace.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It dawns on me that there is now only one major EU nation that does not have an extremist Right-wing party making serious inroads into public life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Britain may have its faults. It may be divided. But unlike France, Germany and the rest, it can still offer a few lessons in community cohesion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some EU politicians may want to treat it like a pariah. Fortunately, those who pay their wages now seem to think otherwise.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Theresa May’s Chequers deal may invoke scorn from both ends of the Brexit spectrum but, in the eyes of German industry, it is a basis for negotiation.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">This was a minor royal wedding played in a major key, presenting our telly hosts with the dilemma of somehow finding the right tone without alienating viewers.

Eamonn had the air of a man upon whom forceps were recently used to extricate him from his favourite La-Z-Boy recliner, while his darling wife appeared to have been up all night cementing her hair with max strength lacquer to combat the 40mph winds swirling around their temporary studio in the Lower Ward of Windsor Castle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It’s a bad bride hair day,’ she said, as the most extraordinary ragbag of guests began staggering down the hill in their wedding-day best. ‘Oh, top of Kate Moss’s head there,’ said Eamonn, helpfully. ‘Holly Valance, very stylish,’ noted Ruth, as the actress wife of property tycoon Nick Candy tottered past in pink heels.</p><img id="i-2b9db5b2cffdc22c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/12/22/5006880-6271063-image-m-14_1539378359782.jpg" height="1212" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-9a4ab169ed2e990c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/12/22/5006872-6271063-image-m-12_1539378310081.jpg" height="1030" width="634" alt="Pixie Geldof and George Barnett, friends of the bride, also attended the second royal wedding of the year" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Two royal weddings in the space of five months. Two dresses, two processions, two trips up the aisle at the ravishing St George's Chapel at Windsor. And two very different mothers-of-the-bride.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first, Doria Ragland, the very model of self-effacing dignity. Alone, unknown and unaccompanied; unfussy, unpretentious, clearly slightly overwhelmed by all the pomp and circumstance – but nevertheless faultless in her behaviour and demeanour on the big day. Just an ordinary woman making the most of an extraordinary situation, savouring every moment of her daughter's triumph.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The second, Sarah Ferguson: the opposite in every way. Brash, bold, basking in the glory of her daughter's royal position, surrounded by old friends and muckers, giggling and gurning at the congregation, brimming with confidence – and back at last where she has always felt she belongs: within the royal fold, next to her ex-husband in the front row of life. Didn't that fist pump as she greeted the crowd say it all!</p><img id="i-b026c36419c8c60c" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/12/21/5005618-0-image-m-23_1539375366559.jpg" height="373" width="634" alt="Fergie's fist pump: The Duchess of York greets the crowds at Windsor Castle with her daughter Beatrice ahead of Princess Eugenie's wedding to Jack Brooksbank on Friday " class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">

Sarah, Duchess of York, told Princess Beatrice: 'My stomach, can't hold my stomach in!' Her giggling daughter replied: 'Mine is OK as I'm wearing a corset.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Zara Tindall remarked pithily to cousin Prince Harry: 'It's very quiet compared to the screaming at your wedding.'</p><img id="i-da0ada390dbfb217" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/12/21/5005556-0-image-m-48_1539375960202.jpg" height="167" width="274" alt="Zara Tindall remarked pithily to cousin Prince Harry: 'It's very quiet compared to the screaming at your wedding.'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Outside the chapel, Sarah was asked by Robbie Williams' daughter Teddy, six, if she was the Queen. 'No,' came the brisk response.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Teddy's pop star dad also seemed impressed. 'Wow, this is awesome ... yeah, yeah,' Robbie exclaimed.</p></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even Doria and Fergie's choices of outfit mirrored their contrasting approaches: they both chose green, but wore it so very differently. Doria, you may remember, was elegant and understated in soft mint; Fergie chose a vivid shade of eye-catching emerald and a winged look-at-me hat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From the moment she arrived, beaming like the Cheshire Cat, she was every inch the incorrigible, rumbustious Fergie of legend, whose behaviour has been a staple pain in the royal backside.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, this was Eugenie's 'Big Day' (and didn't she look gorgeous in her Peter Pilotto dress, arguably better cut and pitched than Meghan's boat-necked Givenchy number?); but it was also without doubt Fergie's 'Moment', the culmination of her long walk back from the wilderness. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prince Philip's presence despite his great age of 97 (it would have been the easiest thing in the world for him to plead illness and skip the whole thing altogether) and famously not her greatest fan, must have been the cherry on the cake.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Behind the scenes, of course, Fergie's rehabilitation has long been widely accepted. She and Andrew, both 58, have described themselves as the 'world's happiest unmarried couple'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They share the newly refurbished Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park and a £13 million chalet in Verbier, Switzerland. For someone Princess Margaret once described as having 'done more to bring shame on the family than could ever have been imagined', she has pulled off a royal rapprochement that few would have predicted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But this public recognition, not just in the eyes of the British public but in front of God and the Queen herself, means so much more. It represents the final stage in a process that has taken the best part of three decades.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And whatever you think of the woman, there is no denying that she has the tenaciousness of a terrier when it comes to getting what she wants.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, she has behaved appallingly on innumerable occasions; but despite it all I cannot help admire her ambition, persistence, humour — and sheer lust for life. So congratulations, Eugenie and Jack: I wish you all the very best. And cheers Fergs: they broke the mould when they made you. </p><div class="item">

It comes courtesy of Jo Johnson, a Transport minister speaking in the Commons yesterday during question time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Johnson (a brother of Boris but less flamboyant with words) was asked about the nine-month delay to the £15billion Crossrail project in <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-8171c2c0-cdae-11e8-86f3-d99512956ffa">London</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Johnson paused. He cleared his tubes. Regurgitating some briefing note, he said the authorities had ‘needed to revise the delivery schedule’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Revise: more congenial than ‘ditch’, see? ‘Delivery schedule’ means ‘deadline’ but Whitehall officials find deadlines too ‘binary’ (a favourite term). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Saying ‘delivery schedule’ is preferable because it sounds positive, slightly technical and best of all is loose. It allows ‘wiggle room’, which is another way of saying room for failure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Will ‘delivery schedule’ work in other walks of life? You there, Willoughby, boy at the back of the class with the oily hair, where the blazes is your chemistry prep? ‘Sorry, miss, but after consultations with stakeholders and in order to improve customer satisfaction going forward, I needed to revise the delivery schedule.’ Willoughby, detention.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Transport Questions, under flapping-limbed, drainpipe-necked Secretary of State Chris Grayling, always has its unintentional comic moments. Some Commons veterans speak well of Mr Grayling and say he cracks on with his work but in the parliamentary arena he is indisputably a gooseberry. Tall, he has to stoop for the despatch box microphone, then returns his head to the upright position with the sudden flick of a giraffe startled at the waterhole.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yesterday he announced the Government’s new ‘Road To Zero strategy’. He was referring to Whitehall thinking on persuading motorists to switch to vehicles that do not pollute the streets (ie zero emissions).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The moment he spooned up that Road To Zero strategy name, parts of the Chamber started to whimper with unsuppressible mirth. It seemed such a perfect description of the May Government, on the Road To Zero votes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mind you, with a character such as Mr Grayling, so often in minus territory, zero could represent an improvement.</p><img id="i-12af33f14ea6c636" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/12/00/4973108-0-image-m-4_1539299011198.jpg" height="492" width="634" alt="Transport Questions, under flapping-limbed, drainpipe-necked Secretary of State Chris Grayling (pictured), always has its unintentional comic moments" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dear old Grayling. He does not quite cop how he is seen by others. When he heard the laughter he plodded onwards, only occasionally looking up to give a dogged, windless, Blakey-from-On-The-Buses smile.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were many complaints about crowded trains. Alec Shelbrooke (Con, Elmet &amp; Rothwell) roared about sardine-tin conditions on morning trains at Woodlesford in his constituency. Mr Johnson, speaking with the modulated tones of an anger-management professional, said there was ‘always room for further improvements’. That’s possibly all there is room for, guvnor.</p><div class="mol-columnist moduleHalf mol-columnist-module"><div class="item">

Another 27 per cent have been waiting up to five years for a suitable home to become available.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Overall, there is a national shortfall of around 800,000 properties. The crisis is particularly acute in <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-3c184ff0-cdae-11e8-b022-ab897511405b">London</a>. So you would be forgiven for thinking that the vast majority of these unfortunate folk might be eternally grateful for any kind of roof over their heads.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most are appreciative, I have no doubt — or would be, in the event of their number coming up on the escape committee.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But sadly not one particular woman, who has rejected seven different houses because they weren’t big enough, or not in the right place, or something. This discerning, some might say ‘picky’, mother-of-two is suing Brent Council, in North-West London, for — yep, you guessed — breaching her yuman rites.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On legal aid, naturally.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The council has even offered a £5,000 grant towards a deposit, which would help her take out a mortgage and buy her own place. This, too, has been rejected out of hand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So who is this doughty campaigner for social justice? I’d love to be able to name her, but I am prevented by a Reporting Restriction Order issued by Deputy High Court Judge Karon Monaghan QC at the Royal Courts of Justice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Newspapers are not allowed to tell you her name because it could help to identify her children, aged five and nine. This is despite the fact that she was named extensively during her high-profile trial at the Old Bailey and subsequent conviction for terrorism offences.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS debate" data-version="2" id="mol-ba1b7cc0-cdad-11e8-b022-ab897511405b">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Lest the snowflakes forget</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Those colour photographs in yesterday’s Mail of British soldiers on the Western Front during World War I were haunting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The young men in the pictures were our grandfathers, our great-grandfathers, many of whom would never return. Yet in the film restored by Lord Of The Rings director Peter Jackson they appear jaunty and ebullient in the face of the dangers ahead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It may well have been bravado, but contrast their good humour with today’s self-obsessed snowflakes, roughly the same age as the soldiers who served and died at the Somme. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shamefully, the students’ union at Cambridge is trying to wreck plans to commemorate the sacrifice of those who fought in World War I, banning poppies and the traditional one minute’s silence. Spoilt millennials appear to have nothing but contempt for earlier generations who gave their lives to ensure our modern freedoms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These pathetic, right-on, playground radicals should study those photographs from the front line and be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Heaven help us if we are ever called upon to fight another world war.</p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Oh, sorry, I forgot to mention that. She was sentenced to 28 months in 2014. Her husband, who is described as a former Islamic State commander, left the UK the previous year to fight in Syria.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Apparently, she is banned from social media and considered to be such a threat to national security that she has to report regularly to the Funny People.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her legal action against Brent began after she was released from prison. Since then she has turned down an assortment of homes, on the grounds that they were too far from her parents, with whom the kids were living while she was doing porridge. One amusing aspect of her claim centres on a complaint that private landlords are reluctant to deal with her because of her criminal record.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You couldn’t make it up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How dare any landlord refuse to accommodate a convicted Islamist fanatic, married to an Izal bigwig? What could possibly go wrong? I mean, it’s her yuman rites, innit?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This woman’s legal battle has already cost taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds, while she has been put up in B&amp;Bs and hotels for the past 16 months.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s never any shortage of money when it comes to defending the rights of terrorists and other criminals who wish us harm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While we may (or more likely, may not) be pulling out of the EU and the European Court of Justice, we will still be subject to the jurisdiction of European human rights laws, the incorporation of which into British statute was once described by Tony Blair as his proudest achievement in government.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here’s what puzzles me about this case. We can’t name this woman as it might identify her kids. But, seeing as she’s considered a threat to national security and in danger of further radicalisation, why the hell haven’t her children been taken into care?</p><img id="i-60c307095c4fa668" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/12/00/4973638-6267423-image-a-20_1539300659011.jpg" height="343" width="634" alt="The young men were our grandfathers, our great-grandfathers, many of whom would never return. Yet in the film restored by Lord Of The Rings director Peter Jackson they appear jaunty and ebullient in the face of the dangers ahead" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">After all, surely they are at grave risk of being brainwashed and radicalised by their mother.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why are we forced to bankroll her attempt to blackmail Brent Council into providing them with a satisfactory home where they can all be together? Consider, too, the way in which the authorities make special arrangements for the families of convicted terrorists like Captain Hook, currently serving 999 years in an American supermax prison, and odious hate preacher Ram Jam Choudary, about to be released after serving a derisory half of his sentence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Still, this madness is at least consistent with the craven approach of the authorities, who are terrified of being accused of ‘Islamophobia’.</p><div class="mol-columnist moduleHalf mol-columnist-module"><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">One memorable morning 14 years ago, when our youngest boy was 11, I happened to come across an essay he’d written about Martin Luther and the Reformation in his history exercise book, which he’d left on the kitchen table.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">OK, I realise now that he’d probably lifted chunks of it from Wikipedia, which had been founded only three years earlier but was already every schoolchild’s favourite crib-sheet. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I have to say I was pretty impressed at the time.</p><img id="i-c4b678eb9428a3a8" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/11/22/4970488-0-image-a-9_1539292683571.jpg" height="427" width="634" alt="Jeremy Corbyn delivering his leader's speech at his party conference last month " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Two pages long, and written in his smallest and neatest handwriting, Harry’s essay was packed with relevant facts and dates that suggested a proper grasp of Luther’s importance in the religious upheaval that was to divide Europe for centuries.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The boy had even got most of his spellings right. Well, some of them, anyway.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It delighted me to think that, despite everything I’d been warned about declining school standards under New Labour, our local comprehensive still insisted on giving its pupils a thorough grounding in the personalities and events that shaped the history of our country and its neighbours.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That was until I read his teacher’s one-line comment at the bottom: ‘You should have written about Martin Luther King!’</p><img id="i-5a4b089b3818af61" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/11/22/4970104-0-image-a-7_1539292412578.jpg" height="459" width="634" alt="Civil rights leader Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. delivers a speech to a crowd of approximately 7,000 people on May 17, 1967" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before the Twittersphere comes crashing down on my head, I must stress that I don’t for a moment underestimate King’s significance in the American civil rights movement. He was a fine, if flowery, orator and a powerful influence for the good on race relations in the U.S. and beyond.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I thought it odd, and still do, that at the age of 11 our son had been instructed to study him, before he’d learned the basics of the story of our past. Like so much else he was taught, this choice of subject matter struck me as nakedly political in intent — more concerned with indoctrination than education.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In my day at school, for example, geography lessons were all about artesian wells, mountain ranges, deserts and river deltas. In his, they seemed to be concerned chiefly with man-made global warming, which was taught as an incontrovertibly proven fact. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The message was that without immediate action, the Planet would be destroyed and mankind wiped out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He and his three brothers were taught plenty about public health issues, too —and in similarly alarmist fashion. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’ll never forget overhearing a remark made to one of our sons by a school friend, when they were both about seven: ‘Your dad smokes, doesn’t he? So how come he’s not dead?’</p><img id="i-c28ed340e35a7cfc" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/11/22/4970136-0-image-a-8_1539292438444.jpg" height="854" width="634" alt="Jamaican born British Crimean War nurse Mary Seacole, also known as Mother Seacole, born in 1805 and died in 1881" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it was in the way we were taught history that the difference between my schooling and theirs was most marked. By my early teens, I’d been made to learn the dates of all the kings and queens of England and great British victories such as Crecy, Agincourt, Waterloo, Trafalgar and the Battle of Britain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’d studied the Norman invasion, the origins of Parliament, the Wars of the Roses, the growth of trade and the Royal Navy under the Tudors, the Reformation, the English Civil War, the Glorious Revolution, the South Sea Bubble, the industrial revolution . . . you name it. Think of Sellar and Yeatman’s parody, 1066 And All That, and you’ll get the general idea.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, I admit my early education tended to accentuate the positive about Britain and its achievements, while playing down the negative. But this helped to instil in me and most of my contemporaries an abiding love of our country and its institutions, which cannot surely be a bad thing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By contrast, my sons’ history lessons always seemed to accentuate the negative about Britain’s past, while all but eliminating the positive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, they focused more on the exploitation of workers during the industrial revolution than on the prosperity it brought — and more on the wickedness of denying women the vote than on centuries of stable parliamentary democracy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All four boys were bombarded with information about the evils of slavery and colonialism and the sins of the British Empire. Meanwhile, whole lessons were devoted to a mixed-race woman called Mary Seacole (more of her in a moment), of whom I confess I’d never heard until the boys told me she was a nursing heroine of the Crimean War, who because she was half-black was shockingly denied the fame accorded to her contemporary Florence Nightingale.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All of which brings me to Jeremy Corbyn’s extraordinary speech yesterday, in which the Labour leader argued that schoolchildren are not taught nearly enough about black history, the wickedness of the Empire or Britain’s role in slavery. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">(And, no, he wasn’t thinking of our country’s magnificent, world-leading role in abolishing the slave trade in 1807, or the 20,000 Royal Navy sailors who laid down their lives to enforce the ban.)</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I can’t have been the only parent who wondered where Mr Corbyn has been all these years, if he didn’t realise that his pet subjects had long been covered ad nauseam in schools — or the only one who hasn’t wished that, just once in a while, our young might be taught something else.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, a colleague tells me his six-year-old son was given a lesson the other day about Rosa Parks, who in 1955 refused to give up her seat to a white passenger in a racially segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As my friend points out, it’s surely unhealthy to introduce the idea of segregation to bewildered six-year-olds in a mixed-race school, where it simply wouldn’t occur to the pupils that people may be judged by the colour of their skin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But to Mr Corbyn, it’s not enough that every October is set aside as ‘black history month’. He wants the subject taught the whole year round, saying: ‘Black history is British history. It is vital that future generations understand the role black Britons have played in our country’s history and the struggle for racial equality.’</p><img id="i-7d3b684019a8a0c1" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/11/22/4970158-0-image-a-1_1539292004779.jpg" height="437" width="634" alt="As for how teachers are supposed to fill all these extra lessons extolling black role models, I note with relief that he doesn’t suggest Idi Amin, Ugandan dictator, pictured above" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He goes on to make the remarkable claim: ‘Slavery interrupted a rich African and black history.’ Can he really be unaware that slavery was flourishing in Africa centuries before the arrival of Europeans, while tribal chiefs were only too eager to exploit the new market for human flesh?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for how teachers are supposed to fill all these extra lessons extolling black role models, I note with relief that he doesn’t suggest Idi Amin, Papa Doc Duvalier or even his fellow Marxist Robert Mugabe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, he proposes that pupils should be taught about Walter Tull, described as ‘a footballing trailblazer and war hero’, Paul Stephenson, who played a central role in the Bristol Bus Boycott in the Sixties and the ubiquitous Mary Seacole.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Abashed by my ignorance of the latter, I’ve been mugging up on her, and I have to admit she sounds a remarkable character.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The daughter of a Scottish Army officer and a Jamaican mother, she was brave, enterprising and resourceful, setting up a hotel and restaurant in the Crimea during the 1853-56 war. She also inspired great affection among sick and wounded soldiers to whom she administered herbal remedies — with mixed results.</p><img id="i-ad2e0a2d86f13b88" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/11/22/4970176-0-image-a-2_1539292008182.jpg" height="417" width="634" alt="Robert Mugabe, above, Zimbabwe's former president who was replaced earlier this year" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">But with the best will in the world, I reckon it’s simply nonsense to suggest she deserves equal billing with Nightingale, who established the world’s first school for nurses and wrote a handbook setting out principles followed to this day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Seacole was not robbed of her due because of her skin colour. In the great sweep of history, she was simply not as important as Nightingale.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But then Mr Corbyn has never been one to allow facts to interfere with his ideology. Anything that reflects badly on our country or the West is fine by him — and brainwashing children is an essential part of every Marxist’s strategy for winning and clinging to power. Tell them both sides of the story, and before you know it they’ll be voting Tory!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I’d hate readers to think I’m entirely politically incorrect. I know smoking is bad for me, and I really shouldn’t do it.</p><img id="i-288c8b98df0f646a" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/11/22/4970492-0-image-a-10_1539292711573.jpg" height="394" width="634" alt="Jeremy Corbyn delivering his keynote speech to his party conference in Liverpool last month" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">I also know we shouldn’t be complacent about global warming. And I know very well that discriminating against fellow human beings on the grounds of their skin colour is profoundly stupid and wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I also know that there’s a huge amount in the history of our country to be proud of — just as there’s masses in the history of hard-Left regimes of which adherents of Mr Corbyn’s politics should be profoundly ashamed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So here’s a suggestion. Instead of banging on endlessly about Mary Seacole and the great Martin Luther King, how about teaching Britain’s children about the estimated 100 million people impoverished and starved to death, tortured and murdered in the name of the Corbynites’ favourite economist and philosopher, Karl Marx?</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Two pages long, and written in his smallest and neatest handwriting, Harry’s essay was packed with relevant facts and dates that suggested a proper grasp of Luther’s importance in the religious upheaval that was to divide Europe for centuries.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Let us agree that man-made <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/climate_change_global_warming/index.html" id="mol-b7eea400-cce4-11e8-8785-d96ad71b6ec8">climate change</a> presents a serious challenge to humanity which should be urgently addressed by every government.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Set aside the protestations of the relatively few climate change sceptics who either deny the world is warming significantly or assert that, even if it is, carbon emissions are not responsible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The non-scientists among us — and even the scientists who know nothing about climate change — would be rash to ignore the consensus among the thousands of experts who have studied the issue. Climate change is taking place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But that doesn’t mean we should meekly swallow all the latest crystal ball gazing by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/united-nations/index.html" id="mol-b7f00390-cce4-11e8-8785-d96ad71b6ec8">United Nations</a> body has just published some blood-curdling warnings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The IPCC pronounces that global carbon dioxide emissions must virtually halve within 12 years to avoid a calamitous loss of coral reefs and Arctic ice, as well as intense floods and droughts.</p><img id="i-3076f3169e36f6d5" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/11/00/05B01D51000003E8-0-image-a-100_1539213431074.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="The IPCC pronounces that global carbon dioxide emissions must virtually halve within 12 years to avoid a calamitous loss of coral reefs" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since there isn’t the remotest possibility that these emissions can be halved in so short a period of time — global emissions have been increasing, albeit slightly, though Britain has cut its own by 43 per cent since 1990 — one might be tempted to curl up in bed with a cup of cocoa and wait for Armageddon to arrive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Except that the IPCC and other supposedly knowledgeable international bodies have produced dire warnings in the past which have not borne fruit. They specialise in making the hairs stand up on the back of our necks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, in 2005 the WWF — formerly the World Wildlife Fund — exceeded even the IPCC’s pessimism at the time, and suggested that all Arctic ice might melt within five years. It’s still there.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the same year, the United Nations Environmental Programme forecast that within five years some 50 million ‘climate refugees’ would be fleeing large areas of the globe which would have been rendered uninhabitable by the effects of climate change. This hasn’t happened yet.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Previous false predictions did not deter the International Energy Agency from informing us in 2011 that we had five years to start slashing carbon emissions, or give up the game. They weren’t cut, and now the IPPC says we have another 12 years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I could go on. The point is that numerous expert bodies have forecast an imminent catastrophe, but it hasn’t happened. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And yet these thwarted soothsayers pop up again without any hint of apology for having got things wrong, as usual invoking the unchallengeable authority of science.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, laymen cheerfully jump on the bandwagon of doom. In March 2009, Prince Charles stated that we had ‘only 100 months to act’ before damage caused by climate change became irreversible. Those 100 months have passed, but no one seems to think the damage can’t be undone.</p><img id="i-25b7626c25430d74" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/11/00/4939504-0-image-a-108_1539213493228.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Prince Charles once stated that we had ¿only 100 months to act¿ before damage caused by climate change became irreversible" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">No less hysterically, Gordon Brown proclaimed as Prime Minister in October 2009 that ‘we had 50 days to save the world’. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was shortly before the Copenhagen summit on climate change. It did not change the world any more than any subsequent conferences on the same subject have done. And yet life still goes on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Isn’t the lesson of all this that it is a perilous business predicting the future — particularly the short-term future — because one can so quickly be demonstrated to have been up the spout?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The danger, of course, is that if self-appointed clairvoyants produce too many spine-chilling prophecies, sooner or later the general public won’t believe anything they say. That would be a great pity, since climate change is a reality.</p><img id="i-4d07d59e8d5d8188" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/11/00/05AEAED4000003E8-0-image-a-109_1539213553245.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Gordon Brown proclaimed as Prime Minister in October 2009 that ¿we had 50 days to save the world¿" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I imagine the thinking of the IPCC and other similar organisations is that the best way to jolt governments and people into action is to exaggerate like mad. In fact, like all those who are seen as habitually crying wolf, they risk ending up being disbelieved.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What is needed, I submit, is a bit more candour and humility on the part of these presumptuous scientists. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Because they are fallible human beings rather than all-knowing gods, they can’t know for sure the magnitude of the risks that face us. And they shouldn’t pretend to.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This week’s IPCC report judged that global warning must be kept to a maximum of 1.5c warmer than pre-industrial levels, rather than the 2c ceiling previously envisaged. How can scientists be so sure that the lower figure should become the new goal?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I ask because it carries enormous extra costs. The IPCC estimates that new energy infrastructure — wind, solar and electricity storage — as well as technologies that can capture CO2 from the atmosphere, could cost a jaw dropping £1,800 billion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This will be paid for by the likes of you and me. Indeed, it is already being met in the form of ‘green levies’. In 2015, these were estimated to amount to an extra £112 a year in energy bills. They are sure to go on rising.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And then there other costs, such as those advocated by the Institution of Engineering and Technology, reported in today’s Mail. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It envisages a deep ‘retro-fit’ with solar panels and triple glazing for 25 million homes.

Gay rights activist Gareth Lee ordered a cake with images of Bert and Ernie, puppets from television show Sesame Street (a former scriptwriter on the show said last month they were gay characters), along with the logo of Queerspace, a gay rights campaign group, and the slogan ‘Support Gay Marriage’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is a strong suspicion Ashers was targeted, because if the order was rejected it was clear it would provoke a political storm. Sure enough, ever since Ashers rejected the order they have been at the centre of an intense international debate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The gay cake row has been making headlines as far afield as Australia and India. The family has been subjected to a torrent of social media abuse. They have been called bigots, religious fanatics, and Christian zealots. Yet they are nothing of the sort.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I met Daniel, who has a degree in aeronautical engineering, and Amy, at their home on the outskirts of Belfast four years ago. I interviewed them just after the Equality Commission For Northern Ireland had publicly trampled over their religious beliefs to make a political point.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They made me welcome, even though they knew I was openly gay and in a civil partnership.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The cake they served me was delicious. They were a delightful couple, but they were bewildered (and still are) by the ferocity of the attacks on them and the way their Christian beliefs were mocked.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They were crystal clear in their view of what had happened: they hadn’t refused to make the cake because Gareth Lee was gay. He was a regular in their bakery, for heaven’s sake, as yesterday’s ruling made clear.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They objected to being drawn into a political controversy in support of gay marriage, which they oppose, and which is still illegal in Ulster.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To hear the hysterical reaction yesterday of some of the gay community, you would think the Supreme Court had legalised discrimination against the LGBT community. The court, in fact, made an important ruling about freedom of expression.</p><img id="i-c650c492759c18dc" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/11/00/4939506-0-image-m-42_1539213680876.jpg" height="457" width="306" alt="They were taken to court yesterday by gay rights' activist Gareth Lee, pictured yesterday outside the Supreme Court in London" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">While Christian bed and breakfast owners in the recent past were clearly wrong to deny services to gay people, this case is different. It is about the refusal to facilitate an idea — namely, support for same-sex marriage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Justice was done yesterday because forcing people to promote a cause they disagree with, especially in an overtly political context, is neither fair nor free.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The issue at stake was not just about special protection for Christians. The truth is, if the McArthurs had lost, freedom of conscience would have been under threat, by order of the State.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m sorry, but the true test of a free and democratic society is that competing views are debated, not crushed by an unaccountable government quango — which, by the way, brought this case at a reported cost to the public purse of hundreds of thousands of pounds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since I came out in my 20s, life has become much easier for gays and lesbians. We have an equal age of consent, civil partnerships, gay marriage, and we can serve on the front line in the military.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But our work is not done. Homophobic abuse is still rife. Only last year at Brighton races I was verbally abused by a group of drunks as ‘that queer bloke off the telly’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My straight friends were aghast.

Let me tell you, it’s easier to be gay in Soho than on the Swindon council estate where I was brought up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But in this more inclusive world, gays must not become authoritarian bullies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There would be a terrible irony if the bigotry and intolerance we have fought against for years was turned instead against committed Christians who have the courage to stand up for their convictions by opposing a change in the definition of marriage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The law should never have been allowed to persecute a decent Christian family which chose to stick to its guns — when baking the cake would have been the easier option.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Recently, the government has rightly announced that straight couples should be able to enter into civil partnerships, which were introduced for same sex couples in 2003.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But how did the pendulum of equality swing so far in one direction that I could have a civil partnership but my straight friends could not?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If Ashers had lost yesterday, it would have been only a matter of time before there was a test case over whether a Muslim printer should be obliged to publish cartoons of the prophet Muhammad, or a Jewish printer to publish a book that propagates Holocaust denial.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Discriminating against people should be illegal, but surely we have the right to disagree with others’ ideas and opinions. The ruling yesterday was a victory for decency and common sense, and will hopefully put a brake on some of the more extreme views voiced by the gay community.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even veteran gay rights activist Peter Tatchell backed Ashers in their right to reject the order.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And I’ve made an important decision.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Prime Minister’s Questions left me hoping the Conservatives lose the next election – lose it so badly their buttocks sting – and that <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/jeremy_corbyn/index.html" id="mol-beee3100-ccdd-11e8-9c65-f7b00832f1df">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, with whom I disagree on almost everything, becomes Prime Minister.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Enter Mrs May before midday. Wild cheers from perhaps three Tories. They were not cheering once she got talking. The <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/snp/index.html" id="mol-bef1da80-ccdd-11e8-9c65-f7b00832f1df">SNP</a>’s Joanna Cherry began by moaning that one of her Polish constituents was having a hard time over his benefits. Mrs May can hardly have been expected to know about this case.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ms Cherry seized on the alleged injustice to take a wider swipe at the UK’s negotiating position on EU citizens in Britain.</p><img id="i-d8b15bcbb3c1107a" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/10/23/4938604-0-image-a-21_1539210864265.jpg" height="345" width="634" alt="Theresa May, pictured, entered the chamber for Prime Minister's Questions today to the wild cheers of perhaps three Tories" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-a2337ca625027f2f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/10/23/4938606-0-image-a-22_1539210981941.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="During the overly-long session, Mrs May served up sentences of congealed porridge" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">A combative parliamentarian might, after commiserating with the Pole for having the acidic and hyperbolic Cherry for his MP, have whacked out an answer about how we could hardly have been more generous to EU expats.

She worded it so blandly, no one stirred an eyelash. Mrs May robotically noted that Mrs Latham was a ‘performing arts ambassador’. It must be one of those titles invented by the Whips to keep MPs sweet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the next 50 minutes – almost twice as long as the session should have been – MPs obsessed over issues with limited resonance. There was much about mental health.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May kept talking about how proud she was of her anti-slavery legislation. ‘Hear hear,’ harrumphed one her remaining swells.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The Height of the Storm by Florian Zeller, Wyndham's Theatre</strong></p><p class="mol-ratings"><strong>Rating: <strong><img class="rating" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/articles/ratingStars/rating_showbiz_4.gif" width="55" /></strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Velvety casting for the West End’s newest play: Dame Eileen Atkins and Jonathan Pryce play an elderly French couple, Madeleine and Andre, married for decades. As happens to all flesh, it comes to an end. One of them has died. But which? Playwright Florian Zeller, always cryptic, leaves us uncertain for much of the 80 minutes of this deftly shattering show.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is not a faultless evening. At times you wish the script would crack on with things. A couple of the minor characters feel contrived. Dame Eileen is no more French than a rasping Hampstead bluestocking and I could have done with 10 per cent more tenderness between the old duo.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet the play touches on something that all loving husbands and wives, after a few years of marriage, must surely discuss: which of us will go first and how on earth will we cope alone? I don’t know about you, but that preys on my mind more with every year of happiness.</p><img id="i-15c3cf6cbdee254b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/10/01/4906306-6258935-image-a-51_1539131731264.jpg" height="953" width="634" alt="Top-class: Jonathan Pryce and Dame Eileen Atkins, a wonderfully watchable stage marriage" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Zeller plays have often been staged with a slick minimalism to match their elusive writing. Here the set is opulently detailed. Designer Anthony Ward has created a tall-ceilinged interior showing us the couple’s kitchen/main room.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Books line the shelves 15ft high and we can just see a mottled mirror down a corridor. Everything is duck-egg blue, faded elegance, haloed by the habitual.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We are told the house is rural but there is little to suggest countryside or indeed France, save for the fact that the characters talk of Paris and Andre eats biscottes for breakfast. Then there is Woman, a mysterious, bosomy, 1950s-costumed character (a strong turn from Lucy Cohu) who arrives with a suggestion of Gallic adultery.</p><img id="i-a41140012c5cc70b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/10/01/4906544-6258935-image-a-52_1539131878175.jpg" height="341" width="634" alt="Jonathan Pryce and Eileen Atkins pose at a photocall for 'The Height Of The Storm'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Did she once have an affair with Andre? M Zeller again leaves that unclear but the intimate siestas described would not quite fit England.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Pryce, with a tremor of jaw and immense, confused, tousle-headed sadness, skilfully adds a decade to his 71 years. Scenes slide in and out of time and reality. One moment Andre will be talking to his adult daughters about selling this home. The next he will be talking to Madeleine as she peels mushrooms for lunch. Seconds later he will be asking where she has gone and the daughters will be wondering if his mind has gone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although it makes for a melancholy evening – a tearful one, even – it has, at its core, a depiction of a strong marriage, and two wonderfully watchable performances by top-class stage artists.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Dame Eileen Atkins and Jonathan Pryce play an elderly French couple, Madeleine and Andre, married for decades.

They took to the airwaves and social media platforms yesterday to express their disbelief at his failure to act.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During my policing career, I worked closely with four commissioners — Paul Condon, John Stevens, Ian Blair and Bernard Hogan-Howe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I know, without a shadow of a doubt, that in the same situation they would have got out of the car and gone to the aid of a colleague.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, Sir Craig, when giving evidence to the inquest into the Westminster terror attack, said it was his ‘instinct’ to get out of the car — but that it was not the right call because he was in ‘shirt sleeves’ with no protective equipment after a meeting with the policing minister at the Commons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Danger</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said that leaving the scene in New Palace Yard, as one of the police constables present insisted, was ‘the right thing to do. ‘That’s when I thought: ‘‘I have got to start putting everything we need in place.’’ We’ve got no protective equipment, no radio, I’ve got two colleagues with me who are traumatised, so we moved out.’</p><img id="i-4b33cabdf8f5f96e" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/10/00/4904186-0-image-m-2_1539129281000.jpg" height="379" width="634" alt="Ex-Acting Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Craig Mackey (above) is guilty of cowardice" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Well, I have news for Sir Craig. Senior police officers do not lead from behind a desk, or hurry back to it, as he did, to take control.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They know they cannot ask their officers to be visible in their community and — when necessary — risk their lives to protect the public if they are not willing to do so themselves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After all, that is exactly what we swore to do in the oath we all took on entering the police service. That’s what young PC Charlie Guenigault did not hesitate to do during the London Bridge terror attack three months later.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 26-year-old had been having an after-work drink when three terrorists struck, targeting those enjoying the city’s vibrant nightlife. He was knifed five times when he tried to tackle one of them</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Afterwards, the Met’s then Deputy Commissioner, one Craig Mackey, said: ‘For PC Charlie Guenigault there was no such thing as ‘‘off duty’’. That summer night in Borough Market, Charlie ran towards the terrorists, putting himself in danger to protect the public. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Without thought for himself, his bravery undoubtedly helped others.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wayne Marques, an officer with the British Transport Police, acted with similar courage that night, too.

As we entered, a mountain of a man appeared at the top of the stairs. Did the officer flinch? No, she carried on up the stairs, confronted him, arrested him and took possession of his knife.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I, too, have grappled in the street with a knife-wielding thief.

Keith was a true hero, a man doing his job and fulfilling his duty, like so many coppers before and since.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He did not flinch, he did not turn and run. He stood his ground in front of the Mother of Parliaments.

They expect — they know — that their colleagues will come to their aid.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That knowledge, the mutual reliance, is the glue that helps bind them all together. It is part and parcel of the honour of holding the office of constable. And the higher up you are in the hierarchy, the greater is that obligation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Being a senior officer is about doing the right thing, being seen to do the right thing, about ensuring the policies and resources match the foreseeable risks that your officers are likely to face. It also means leading from the front.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Re-reading Sir Craig’s account at the inquest yesterday, of the horror and tragedy unfolding before his eyes, serving and former officers like me wonder why he didn’t instruct his driver to use his car — in all likelihood armour-plated — to run Khalid Masood down?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Shame</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Or open the car window and throw something at the assailant to distract him, just something, anything, that might have bought PC Keith Palmer time or brought others to his aid?

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">In a statement yesterday, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police explained that an ‘operational decision had been made with a police officer at the scene that Sir Craig should not get out and that he and the two civilian police staff should leave immediately.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were officers present with the necessary skills to neutralise the threat and administer first aid, the spokesman added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A justification of sorts — but I am still left wondering why he simply did not over-rule other officers? He was the Acting Met boss. He simply cannot hide behind this statement in my view. Or make the excuse that he didn’t have a radio. What difference would that have made?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If I was being kind, I’d put it down to Sir Craig’s lack of experience. He arrived at the Met in 2012 and may have reached the top but for almost 20 years he worked outside London in Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Cumbria.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is very little on the front line there to compare with the violent situations regularly seen in the capital, let alone random terror attacks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sir Craig, who reverted to the role of deputy commissioner in April last year, is retiring in December. Perhaps we should just leave him to live with his shame. Call me old school, but I’d prefer it if he took some responsibility.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If I was him, I’d hand back my knighthood. The grand title and all it implies doesn’t really fit with his actions the day a brave policeman was murdered by a terrorist.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>As a police officer who served for 32 years, latterly as a Chief Superintendent, it saddens me to say it, but the former Acting Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Craig Mackey, is guilty of cowardice, writes PHILIP FLOWER.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Six months ago, Britain rolled out the red carpet in fine style for Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the man who is the heir apparent in <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/saudi_arabia/index.html" id="mol-05c303d0-cc1b-11e8-ab6c-7bd82d696c5b">Saudi Arabia</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was given lunch with the Queen, enjoyed an earnest discussion about interfaith relations at Lambeth Palace with the Archbishop of Canterbury, and was hosted for dinner by the Prince of Wales.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were also long, detailed – and doubtless highly profitable – talks with <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/theresa_may/index.html" id="mol-05c12f10-cc1b-11e8-ab6c-7bd82d696c5b">Theresa May</a> about British trade with Saudi Arabia, which reportedly established a £65billion trade and investment target, some of which would involve lucrative arms sales to the desert kingdom.</p><img id="i-27277b05b49e68be" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/10/00/4904860-6258777-image-a-17_1539127585725.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ,left, met the Queen, right, at Buckingham Palace during a private audience in March" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-254596b2f992d791" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/10/00/4904740-6258777-image-a-8_1539127061781.jpg" height="460" width="634" alt="Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi, pictured, is believed to have been murdered in gruesome circumstances by thugs employed by the Saudi monarchy" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-d087e4dec528c7dc" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/10/00/4904824-6258777-image-a-16_1539127372124.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Members of the Turkish-Arab journalist association, pictured, hold a demonstration outside the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul to protest against the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Earlier, the PM had said in the Commons that ‘the link that we have with Saudi Arabia is historic, it is an important one, and it has saved the lives of potentially hundreds of people in this country’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">People who should have known much better hailed Bin Salman, who is only 33, as a great reformer whose mission is to drag his country into the 21st century. A hugely expensive PR campaign highlighted the fact that, thanks to him, Saudi cinemas are opening after decades of closure, while women are at last being allowed – heresy of heresies – to drive a car.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there has always been a dark side to this Saudi Crown Prince, and his Western admirers had absolutely no excuse not to know this.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">As he sat down with Mrs May, hundreds of his political opponents – some of whom had been tortured in gruesome ways – languished in Saudi jails. Meanwhile, the Saudi bombing campaign in neighbouring Yemen – as part of a war against rebel forces seeking to overthrow the Yemeni government to which it is allied – continued to claim thousands of innocent lives in what the United Nations has called the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, many very troubling question marks continue to surround the long Saudi relationship with the Al Qaeda terror group.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it has taken the disappearance of the exiled Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi to bring home the moral bankruptcy of the Bin Salman regime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is because Mr Khashoggi, who is feared to have been murdered in gruesome circumstances by thugs employed by the Saudi monarchy, is known to many in the West.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, he was here in Britain only a fortnight ago for a public meeting in which he criticised Saudi plans for a so-called ‘deal of the century’ to undertake massive new construction programmes.</p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Jamal Khashoggi, a gentle bear of a man, was a journalist of undoubted integrity who illuminated any conversation he took part in. He was no deranged revolutionary. He was not even against the House of Saud, the dynasty which British agents put on the throne almost 100 years ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He supported gradual reform. For example, he supported capital punishment and, in its early stages at least, the Saudi offensive in Yemen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Though he lived in exile, he had close connections with the Saudi royal family. He used to be an adviser to Prince Turki al-Faisal, ex-director of Saudi intelligence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It may be, says one source quietly, that he knew too much.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The facts, according to Turkish police, are grim. Mr Khashoggi was planning to marry his Turkish fiancee Hatice Cengiz. However, Turkish law does not allow polygamy. So he needed to get papers from Saudi Arabia proving that he was divorced from his first wife. Hence his visit last Tuesday to the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what should have been a routine event swiftly turned to horror.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Turkish police believe that a 15-strong hit squad had been sent specially from Saudi Arabia. Flight records show that two Saudi planes arrived in Istanbul last Tuesday, and departed separately later the same day, hours after the journalist went missing. The suspicion now is that Mr Khashoggi was tortured, murdered, and then dismembered.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a further ghastly detail, Turkish police believe everything was videotaped by the assassins to prove that the mission was accomplished.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Khashoggi appeared on CCTV entering the consulate, but he never emerged. Nothing has been seen or heard of him since, though Turkish officials say a convoy of vehicles left the consulate around two hours after Mr Khashoggi arrived there.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let’s hope and pray that these horrifying reports, denied by the Saudi Crown Prince, are false. Certainly none of this has been confirmed by Turkish President Erdogan, who was a personal friend of Mr Khashoggi. Of course Erdogan has very strong reasons for remaining silent. His country faces a catastrophic financial crisis, and Saudi Arabian loans are his best hope of solvency.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Britain, Jeremy Hunt has spoken forcefully to the Saudi ambassador and the country’s foreign minister, and Downing Street says it’s ‘working urgently’ to establish the facts. However we’ve still heard nothing from Prime Minister Theresa May herself. She, too, may have her reasons for remaining silent. But that silence is in danger of looking like hypocrisy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Britain rightly created an international outcry when two trained assassins from the GRU (Russian military intelligence) secretly entered Britain on a mission to murder former Russian spy Sergei Skripal. But a week after 15 Saudi goons are thought to have secretly flown into a Nato country to kill a well-known Saudi journalist, we surely should have heard from the Prime Minister on this serious matter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Britain claims to stand up for human rights and decency. We must show that we do. If we are only too happy to express outrage when one of our stated enemies such as Russia commits an atrocity, we must demonstrate robustly that we are not looking the other way when an ally such as Saudi Arabia does the same thing or worse. Otherwise it is double standards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The shocking truth is that the Saudis – just like the Russians – have a long history of abducting and silencing critics of the Riyadh regime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fifteen years ago, Prince Sultan Bin Turki was abducted from Geneva after calling for political reform in his native Saudi Arabia. At least he wasn’t killed, and later he was able to flee back to Europe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Others have not been so lucky. One dissident Saudi prince, Saud Bin Saif al-Nasr, vanished three years ago and – like Mr Khashoggi – has not been seen since. It is thought he may have been tricked into boarding a flight back to Saudi.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even the heroine of the campaign for women to drive, Loujain al Hathloul, was was arrested in May this year and imprisoned on charges that she has attempted to destabilise the Saudi kingdom.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Till now, Britain has kept quiet about such cases, and our reticence is understandable. Tens of thousands of highly skilled British jobs depend on our arms trade with Saudi Arabia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">British prime ministers feel they have a duty to preserve such jobs, even if it means effectively condoning terrible human rights abuses. And of course we rely on Saudi Arabia for oil.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the United States, the relationship with the Saudis is even more intimate. Mr Khashoggi’s sharp criticisms of the House of Saud’s humiliating dependence on President Trump may be one reason he incurred the enmity of the regime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But we increasingly live in a world dominated by repressive regimes that don’t care a damn for the truth, and will murder citizens at will in order to suppress criticism.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, this has been a terrifying week for free speech.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The head of Interpol was detained and forced to resign by the increasingly corrupt and autocratic Chinese regime. In Bulgaria, the investigative journalist Viktoria Marinova was raped and murdered.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jamal Khashoggi has vanished, presumed dead – and Britain has, it seems, nothing to say.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Theresa May may have calculated that, post-Brexit, our only hope is to do business with any regime, no matter how cruel. It’s understandable, and – some might argue – patrotic. But aren’t we supposed to be better than that?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the very least it is time that Theresa May publicly asked one simple question of the Saudi Crown Prince: what’s happened to Jamal Khashoggi?</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, pictured, is believed to have been murdered in gruesome circumstances by thugs employed by the Saudi monarchy, writes PETER OBORNE.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Peter Oborne For The Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-10T01:29:28.000+02:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>PETER OBORNE: Why does Britain cosy up to Saudi Arabia</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-10T01:29:28.000+02:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/10/00/4904740-0-image-a-13_1539127315228.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1104735</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>AP</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-6258633/Did-syphilis-make-Shakespeare-furious-women.html" title="Shakespeare was 'angry with women after one gave him an STD', literary expert claims"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6258645/Sir-James-Dyson-unveils-new-Airwrap-curling-tong-minimises-risk-heat-damage.html" title="Dyson unveils its revolutionary new £450 hair tongs that blast high-speed jets of air around its styling barrel to give you fuller curls without burning your locks"></link></item><item><title>As doctors try group appointments, CRAIG BROWN says it's time to say: 'Actually, I do mind if you join me!'</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6254797/As-doctors-try-group-appointments-CRAIG-BROWN-says-Actually-mind-join-me.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Oct 2018 00:49:09 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6254797</guid><description><![CDATA[Which question from a stranger is guaranteed to make your heart sink?

There’s plenty of competition. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For me, ‘Would you mind stepping out of the car, sir?’ ranks pretty high, and so does any question beginning with the words, ‘Can I interest you in . . .?’  But the one I dread most is, ‘Mind if we join you?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Up to now, it has been a question confined to public spaces.

We have been led to believe that nothing is worth doing if it is not done in company. At work, offices are open-plan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the home, walls have been knocked down to make larger, more friendly living spaces. Isolation is the great taboo.

Even Michael Gove, with his famous suspicion of experts, is unlikely to favour the opinion of a fellow patient above that of his own GP.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Likewise, the ‘supportive peer-group settings’ are meant to be a haven for those suffering from obesity or chilblains or erectile dysfunction, but the nervy patient will worry that they are more of a go-to event for the nosy-parker and the blabbermouth. ‘Mind if I join you?’ If an individual were to put his head around the door and ask this question as your GP was taking a closer look at, say, a pimple on your bottom, then most of us would feel a sense of intrusion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the other hand, if 14 people were to put their heads around the door, all at the same time, saying ‘Mind if I join you?’ then — abracadabra! — we are meant to believe that the scene would be magically transformed into ‘a one-to-one clinical consultation delivered in a supportive peer-group setting’.</p><img id="i-20a311815dbfc544" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/09/01/4874088-0-image-a-4_1539045680246.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Slowly but surely, over the past few decades the world has grown more chummy.

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">In the days before rolling news, coverage of the conferences was about the only time voters got to see the politicians in action.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now MPs are in our faces around the clock. Never has the old saw about politics being showbiz for ugly people been more apposite. But their ubiquity shouldn't allow them to kid themselves anyone's taking any notice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For instance, one of the go-to bores on Brexit is Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a particular favourite of TV producers, usually in tandem with Here We Go Soubry Loo.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On Thursday night, I turned on the Andrew Neil show to see what regular panellist Alan Johnson made of the two main party conferences — only to discover arch-Remainer Umunna sitting next to Michael Portillo instead.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Earlier in the day, I'd been watching Pointless. The contestants are asked a series of questions and their answer is judged against the response of 100 people given 100 seconds to come up with a reply to the same question.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The lowest score wins. On this edition they were asked to name a number of prominent individuals born in 1978. One of them was the shadow business secretary between 2011-2015, initials 'CU'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The highest score was former Chelsea footballer, now Derby manager, Frank Lampard, who was recognised by 59 out of 100, followed on 37 by a Pussycat Doll (whatever that is) and ex-rugby star Mike Tindall, on 36.</p><img id="i-c3abf5747aa76a3" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/08/14/4728536-6252811-As_Dancing_Queen_by_Abba_played_Mrs_May_emulated_her_famous_danc-a-12_1539006680886.jpg" height="512" width="306" alt="As 'Dancing Queen' by Abba played, Mrs May emulated her famous dance moves" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-982909fde8614035" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/08/14/4728534-6252811-Mrs_May_showed_off_dance_moves_first_seen_in_Africa-a-13_1539006680890.jpg" height="512" width="306" alt="Mrs May showed off dance moves first seen in Africa" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">The lowest was CU, yep, Chuka Umunna, who was identified by just three people. That's right, three.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also trailed the golfer Bubba Watson and the actress who played Don Draper's missus in Mad Men.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So there you have it. Outside the Westminster bubble, only three per cent of people have ever heard of Chuka Umunna.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Next time Andrew Neil wants to ask someone about Brexit, he'd be better off inviting a Pussycat Doll.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Or Frank Lampard, come to that. At least Frank's got a track record of winning in Europe.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Four-day week? Talk about back to the future!</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Labour's latest vote-winning wheeze is a plan to reduce the standard working week from five days to four.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has hinted that the pledge could be included in his party's manifesto for the 2022 General Election. The TUC is already agitating for the introduction of a statutory four-day week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Labour believes that new technology and automation offer the opportunity to cut working hours for everyone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's an argument we've heard time and again ever since the advent of computerisation, which was supposed to lead to longer leisure time by freeing workers from drudgery. That was the theory, anyway.</p><img id="i-3908556f3b94386" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/09/00/4873574-6254677-image-a-1_1539042939685.jpg" height="364" width="634" alt="Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has hinted that the pledge could be included in his party's manifesto for the 2022 General Election" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">In reality, the opposite has happened. People may not be chained to desks or machinery as much as they were in the past, but the advent of mobile phones, texts and emails means that in many sectors of the economy hardly anyone is ever off duty.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Far from a reduction in the working week creating jobs, which is supposed to be a beneficial side-effect, all the evidence points to the contrary. When France introduced a legally enforcible 35-hour week, unemployment went through the roof.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's also been tried before. When I arrived in Fleet Street in the late Seventies, most staff were on a four-day week. As an economic model, it proved unsustainable as newspapers racked up enormous financial losses.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS debate" data-version="2" id="mol-cc5a9520-cb54-11e8-a52f-a7e6e7e784f2">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Labour voters won't get fooled again</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to an article she wrote for the Left-wing, anti-Brexit Observer — aka the Guardian on Sunday — Mother Theresa says she intends to reach out to traditional Labour supporters in a bid to stay in power.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She may have to, because it doesn't look like there's much danger of her reaching out to traditional Tory voters any time soon, especially the millions who voted for Brexit. But what makes her think Labour voters, who backed Leave in their millions, would switch their allegiance to her — especially as she has no intention of honouring her 'Brexit means Brexit' promise? Or fulfilling her threat of taking Britain out of Europe with no deal, rather than a bad deal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whatever else traditional Labour voters may be, they're not stupid.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was when the power of the unions was at its peak. No wonder the TUC wants to turn the clock back. Although the plan is being sold as liberating the workers, it is in effect merely part of a wider assault on individual freedom.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One significant element of the motivation behind the campaign to force part-time workers in the gig economy to be treated as full-time employees is to drive them into the arms of the unions and deny them the flexibility to pick and choose when and where they work. It's a way of imposing collective bargaining on fast-moving tech companies, such as Uber.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This isn't a great leap forward, it's back to the future.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And never mind the four-day week, we also experimented with a three-day week in the Seventies. It was a panic measure brought in by Grocer Heath's government to mitigate power shortages caused by the OPEC oil price crisis and industrial action by coal miners.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For just over two months at the beginning of 1974, companies could only operate three days a week to conserve energy. Pubs and cinemas were forced to close early and television shut down at 10.30pm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I recall vividly sitting in the office typing by candlelight, brewing tea on a Calor gas stove before going home in the dark to huddle in bed under a pile of scratchy sheets and blankets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was a struggle to keep warm because the pitiful storage heaters relied on a steady supply of cheap overnight electricity, which had been switched off.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As far as Britain's economy was concerned, the three-day week was a disaster. Productivity and output nosedived, firms started laying off staff and between January and March 885,000 more people registered for unemployment benefits. Still, Corbyn and McDonnell have a peculiar, rose-tinted nostalgia for the Seventies, which they seem to think was some kind of workers' nirvana.</p><img id="i-f384873b616aa7c5" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/09/00/4873594-6254677-image-a-2_1539042976246.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="British Prime Minister Theresa May greets supporters after her speech at the annual Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, England" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">All their main policies hark back to the decade before the Thatcher revolution, when the unions ruled the roost and the United Kingdom was considered the Sick Man of Europe. Demands for a shorter working week were routinely bolted on to extortionate pay claims in the late Seventies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Few under 50 can have the faintest idea what Britain was like then. Today's pampered and indulged Corbynista millennials wouldn't last five minutes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Accustomed to an unlimited selection of mobiles available online 24/7, how would they cope with being expected to wait six months before the Post Office Engineering Union got round to installing any kind of telephone?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once the four-day week's up and running, perhaps Labour could reintroduce some of the other quaint policies which contributed to life's rich tapestry four decades ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most people would only work Monday to Friday, eight-to-four or nine-to-five, when they would have to clock off. The shops would shut at six, close half-days on Thursdays and all day Sunday. Television would start at teatime and go off air before midnight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pubs would only open between 11am and 2.30pm, then reopen from 5.30pm until 10.30pm. Sunday lunchtime would be restricted to two hours between noon and 2pm and from 7pm to 10pm in the evening.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And you could forget about taking an Uber home back then. There weren't any. Nor would there be today if Labour had its way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you were lucky, the last bus might not leave until 11pm — that's always assuming the drivers weren't on strike in support of a demand for a four-day week . . .</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: In the days before rolling news, coverage of the conferences was about the only time voters got to see the politicians in action.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">How fascinating. How audacious. And how very revealing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">First and foremost, this latest manoeuvre is an indication that Mrs May is preparing for the possibility of having to fight an emergency general election in just a few weeks’ time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Prime Minister still thinks she is on the verge of striking a Brexit deal with Brussels. This could, believes Mrs May, be in place in time for the European summit being held in nine days, although it may have to wait until November.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the Prime Minister’s great fear is that her master plan will then be voted down in the House of Commons by a combination of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party, Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP and Tory Brexiteers who are unwilling to compromise in their pursuit of a clean break from the EU.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Were that to happen, I understand from a senior source within Number 10 that Mrs May intends to break the constitutional deadlock by calling a general election.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is why she is aiming to portray herself as Mrs Moderate – the only sensible alternative between Jeremy Corbyn’s hard-Left Labour Party and the hard Brexiteers in her own party.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is a strategy, as Mrs May well knows, which was used brilliantly by Tony Blair against John Major’s failing Tories in 1997.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Blair deliberately positioned New Labour as the halfway house between the rancid Tory Right on one side and the unions and Labour’s hard-Left on the other.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He won with a mammoth majority of 179 seats – and Labour stayed in power for the following 13 years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May is hoping that she can repeat the Blairite triumph, and I can see why. But there are large dangers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is always the chance that Labour voters tempted by the ersatz socialism on offer from Mrs May will decide that they prefer the real thing offered by John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, an even greater risk is that in her desperation to win over Labour supporters she alienates traditional Conservative voters.</p><img id="i-2968e35db8d579c8" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/08/00/4846064-6250371-image-a-1_1538953848697.jpg" height="453" width="634" alt="This is exactly the same judgment made by Tony Blair when he mounted his audacious bid for middle-class votes, shifting his party’s focus from its traditional working-class base" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In her Observer article yesterday, Mrs May repeated the promise made in her party conference speech last week to end austerity. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Though she did not say so, that will inevitably have to be paid for by higher taxation – anathema to the hard-pressed Tory voters of middle England.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her calculation is that these hardline Tories have no one else to vote for, and that rather than abstain or switch allegiance to parties such as Ukip they will suck their teeth and conclude that anything is better than Corbyn.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is exactly the same judgment made by Tony Blair when he mounted his audacious bid for middle-class votes, shifting his party’s focus from its traditional working-class base. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Blair’s adoption of the centre ground was so effective that following the election he was able to add two Tory defectors to the enormous numbers crowding Labour’s benches, with Peter Temple-Morris and Shaun Woodward crossing the floor within two years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How our Prime Minister would love a Labour MP to come over to the Tory side.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Former shadow cabinet minister Chuka Umunna, who has signalled his opposition to Corbyn, is one potential Conservative target. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is talk he may even be offered a Cabinet job as an inducement, though his strong opposition to Brexit means he may decide to stay put for now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These are strange times indeed. While the Tory leader copies Blair, in the Labour Party the triple election winner is regarded as a pariah. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the edge of what may yet be the third general election in three years, we have entered a period of political cross-dressing.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>At first sight it looks a brilliant stroke by Theresa May. Writing in the Left-wing Observer newspaper, she launched a direct appeal to disillusioned Labour voters. Her Tory Party, claims the Prime Minister, is the natural home for traditional Labour supporters horrified by Jeremy Corbyn’s lurch to the Left. ‘I want voters who may previously have thought of themselves as Labour supporters to look at my government afresh,’ wrote Mrs May. ‘They will find a decent, moderate and patriotic programme that is worthy of their support.’ How fascinating.

First and foremost, this latest manoeuvre is an indication that Mrs May is preparing for the possibility of having to fight an emergency general election in just a few weeks’ time.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Peter Oborne For The Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-08T11:59:20.000+02:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>May's attempts to win-over Labour voters political cross dressing</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-08T11:59:20.000+02:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/07/21/4844034-0-image-a-4_1538944982154.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1104735</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>AP</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6249767/20-people-killed-New-York-limo-crash-way-wedding.html" title="'How do you go on when four of your daughters die?'

<div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Democrats have promised that if they win the congressional elections in November, they’ll call for a full hearing into the charges against Kavanaugh. But before they get there, we can expect young women opponents of Brett Kavanaugh – a proxy for the president – to be out in force in the election campaigns.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Right now there is a gap of some 30 points between men and women college graduates in voting intentions. As political analyst David Frum observed: ‘It’s men versus women.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is a generalisation – obviously there are many male feminists who oppose Kavanaugh and many women who support him – but right now the most obvious feature of US politics is how much it is about gender.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Senate vote came to a head just in time for the first birthday of the #MeToo movement, and that was anything but an accident. In a way, the allegations are the political expression of that movement.</p><img id="i-365819ddd007cf49" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/07/01/4829820-6248349-image-a-22_1538871102395.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="U.S. Capitol Police arrest protesters from the steps of the Capitol in the hours ahead of a scheduled U.S. Senate vote on the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee  Brett Kavanaugh" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations – which struck everyone as wholly sincere – resembled that Simpsons sketch from 1994, in which Homer is accused of sexual harassment and a reporter tells his accuser when she is unable to support her charge: ‘That’s OK. Your tears say more than real evidence ever could.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was no actual evidence from Dr Ford that would have passed muster in a court of law, nothing that would have justified police in bringing a criminal case against Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But he still found himself undergoing something like a criminal trial rather than a Senate hearing to confirm his suitability to be a Supreme Court judge.</p><img id="i-35be89fee7dd3b5b" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/07/01/4830020-6248349-image-a-24_1538871149446.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Retired Justice Anthony M Kennedy, right, administers the Judicial Oath to Judge Brett Kavanaugh in the Justices' Conference Room of the Supreme Court Building" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The protests during the process tell us lots about the new politics of emotion. When Susan Collins, a wavering Republican, gave a 45-minute speech explaining that she supported him because due process mattered to her, she had to struggle to be heard because of angry protesters. When Democrat Senator Joe Manchin tried to explain his decision to back Kavanaugh, he was drowned out by demonstrators – mostly young women – shouting: ‘Shame, shame, shame… You betrayed us! Think of your daughters!’ Police had to escort him away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The strength of the #MeToo movement is that it brings into the open the experience of many women who have been harassed by powerful men. The trouble is, the weaknesses of the movement have been exposed by being harnessed to the Kavanaugh controversy: chiefly the contention that subjective experience is all you need, that a woman who accuses a man of assault must always be believed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a lawyer friend observed: ‘This whole thing is the apotheosis of Twitter, because on Twitter virtue is victimhood; victimhood is status and status is everything.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No one, not even Kavanaugh, disputed that she had been assaulted; what he did dispute was that he was the assailant.</p><img id="i-1cec454804b52e01" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/07/01/4830022-6248349-image-a-26_1538871212684.jpg" height="414" width="634" alt=" As Antonin Scalia, a formidable (conservative) Supreme Court judge, once observed, judges are deciding whether particular laws are consistent with the US Constitution" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The politics of anger seen last week is the subject of a new book called Nervous States: How Feeling Took Over The World, by political scientist William Davies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He had conservative populists in mind, like Trump supporters, but what is evident is that the primacy of personal feeling over everything else characterises the politics of gender too. The banners protesters held up during the past few days say it all: ‘Believe Her’. ‘Women Must Be Heard’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On Thursday, demonstrators chanted: ‘Arrest sexual predators, not protesters.’ They cheered at a banner saying: ‘We Believe All Survivors.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many recounted their own experience of assault: one woman wore a T-shirt saying: ‘Standing up for my 12-year-old self.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is real, felt emotion – it just shouldn’t play a part in appointing judges. The divisions over Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment are, I’d say, misplaced. As Antonin Scalia, a formidable (conservative) Supreme Court judge, once observed, judges are deciding whether particular laws are consistent with the US Constitution.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is for democratically elected representatives to make laws about abortion or gun control, not the Supreme Court.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">When will people grasp the difference between what the Tory Party says it is, and what it actually is? It is not as if it tries hard to hide it. Here is a clue. It is not conservative at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is a machine for obtaining power. It would cheerfully guillotine the Queen in Trafalgar Square if it thought that by doing so it could keep or gain office.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is why it has spent the past 20 years becoming more Blairite than New Labour.</p><img id="i-2dd4908e582c7e03" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/07/01/4827930-0-image-a-1_1538871479692.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Theresa May, who can seldom stop herself mentioning that she is a parson’s daughter, chose her party’s conference to declare that she now backs civil partnerships for heterosexuals" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It helps to pay attention. Last week’s single most far-reaching act by the May Government was to strike the final death-blow at the institution of marriage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You would have thought a self-styled ‘Conservative’ Party would like marriage. It is all about private life, the keeping of promises, and saving what we can of the Christian religion in a society that prefers to worship at shopping malls and football stadiums.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Theresa May, who can seldom stop herself mentioning that she is a parson’s daughter, chose her party’s conference to declare that she now backs civil partnerships for heterosexuals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unlike her grotesque attempts at dancing, this attracted little attention. That is a pity.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">After a period of ‘consultation’ in which conservative voices will be sneeringly ignored, this change will happen. And Britain will have roughly the same attitude towards family life as the old Soviet Union did – a temporary contract in a world where everyone’s real parent is the almighty state.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Civil partnerships are state licences for co-habitation. They are deliberately stripped of any remaining religious content. That is why radicals have been campaigning for them for so long. There is no room in them for the ‘sexist’ distinction between husband and wife. And they will be easier to get out of than a car-leasing agreement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But they will give those who enter them the same legal rights, in terms of pensions, inheritance and next-of-kin privileges, as those who make the much deeper commitment of lifelong marriage, still just about available at a church near you.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-dfa83310-c9c6-11e8-80ce-3fb1392fe5eb">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> Civil partnerships are state licences for co-habitation. They are deliberately stripped of any remaining religious content</div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">From now on, the only people who live together, but will not be able to get these protections, will be brothers and sisters, who continue to be driven from their former homes by inheritance tax when one of them dies. So why bother with the tougher option? Just as bad money drives out good, these feeble half-commitments will supplant marriage for most.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The change, designed for the convenience of adults who don’t want to be too bound by a deep pledge, will leave almost no barrier between children and the mighty forces of the government on one hand and greedy commerce on the other.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is the fulfilment of a prophecy made by the contraceptive fanatic and ultra-liberal moral reformer Helen Brook, who proclaimed in 1980: ‘From birth till death it is now the privilege of the parental State to take major decisions – objective, unemotional, the State weighs up what is best for the child.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the Tory Party believed in anything, it would never have accepted this revolutionary change, or many of the other ghastly, Left-wing things it does to try to keep its ratings up. But it believes in nothing. And that is why it could so very easily lose the next Election to a Labour Party which does believe in something.</p><div class="item">

It says: ‘In the discharge of their function to protect national security, the security service [that’s MI5] has a long-standing policy for their agent handlers to agree to agents participating in crime, in circumstances where it is considered such involvement is necessary and proportionate in providing or maintaining access to intelligence that would allow the disruption of more serious crimes or threats to national security.’ In other words, they are licensed to commit very serious crime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">British undercover police officers have also fathered children with women they were spying on, and then vanished, which seems pretty cruel and ruthless to me.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-ec255fa0-c9c6-11e8-80ce-3fb1392fe5eb">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> British undercover police officers have also fathered children with women they were spying on, and then vanished</div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the free West in general has not always been wholly competent. The CIA’s absurd attempts to kill Fidel Castro, including exploding cigars, come to mind. So does the more tragic episode of the Rainbow Warrior, the Greenpeace ship blown up by French spooks, in which an innocent man died. Remember the ridiculous ‘fake rock’, which MI6 installed in Moscow, a high-tech dead letterbox designed to look like a lump of stone? Russian agents detected it and in 2006 released film of MI6 handlers passing secret messages through it, presumably intended for Russian spies in British pay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Russian TV showed a British diplomat walking past the rock with his eyes shifting wildly as he was secretly watched by FSB counter-intelligence. Another British diplomat was filmed kicking the malfunctioning rock, and then picking it up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My advice in all such matters is ‘Calm down, dear’. Russia is in no position to attack us. Its economy is the size of Italy’s and failing badly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, we pay no attention to the real threat from China, which has now extended its influence into South America, and into Eastern Europe, and which grows more powerful every day.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>A people's vote?

This is the cause of the mess we are now in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But surely votes of all kinds must be final?

<p class="mol-para-with-font">At the Conservative Party Conference, <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/theresa_may/index.html" id="mol-f97d2700-c9c1-11e8-9974-fda3a82ad775">Theresa May</a> boasted about Britain's 'world-leading' universities. This has become one of her staple lines – in September she told world leaders that investing in Britain would give them access to the 'best universities'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I like Mrs May, but she's living in an alternate universe – one in which our academic institutions are beacons of intellectual development where students find the cure for cancer over a Pot Noodle. The reality is the complete opposite.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Almost every news story about universities is either depressing or bonkers. But mostly bonkers. Don't believe me? In one of the craziest examples, the University of Manchester Students' Union has decided to ban clapping and cheering at union events because it is discriminatory and non-inclusive. </p><img id="i-72bb8768dfe9e627" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/07/00/4829408-6248335-image-a-14_1538868869430.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="The University of Manchester Students' Union has decided to ban clapping and cheering at union events because it is discriminatory and non-inclusive" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, students will have to use 'jazz hands' – a wave of both hands in the air.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Union officer Sara Khan says jazz hands would encourage 'an environment of respect'. I say Sara needs to get out more.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While clapping has been deemed morally offensive by Manchester, Brighton University has decided prostitution is fine (although, of course, its students would never use that word). So fine, in fact, that it allowed something called the Sex Workers' Outreach Project to have a stall at its latest Freshers' Fair.</p><div>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">This event might, for many parents, evoke images of their little darling going to pick up a leaflet about the rugby club, am-dram society or chess group. Forget that at Brighton, where students can go along to weigh up whether to top up their loans by selling their bodies for sex.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I'd like to say these are rare examples of strange things happening, but the truth is Mrs May's 'world-leading' universities have become one of the worst elements of our culture and young people need to think very hard about whether they're worth bothering with at all. Perhaps the biggest question to ask about universities is: why do so many go in the first place?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the main reasons is that it's expected in our society, as the public still holds on to an old- fashioned view of degrees, believing them to be the great engine of social mobility. These days – except for at the top universities – almost the reverse is true.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A parliamentary report last year showed that 40 per cent of those aged 25 to 34 have degrees but 47 per cent of them work in non-graduate jobs.</p><img id="i-beffd6b3afeb34fa" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/07/00/4829508-6248335-image-a-15_1538868960700.jpg" height="663" width="634" alt="Jeremy Vine weighed into the ban with a tweet mocking it" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">A job market awash with over-qualified souls is one of Tony Blair's worst, but lesser-known legacies, courtesy of the arbitrary target he set for 50 per cent of school pupils to go to university.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This nonsensical idea created a massive number of unwanted graduates when the economy crashed in 2008. Most of them had been armed with theoretical lessons, but no practical ideas of how to get through a recession.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I know – because I was one of them, graduating in 2010. When unemployment is high, people need entrepreneurial nous more than ever, but these skills are in deficit because of the British emphasis on university above apprenticeship.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today the economy is much healthier, but there are still too many graduates for the number of graduate jobs on offer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There has long been a big disparity between the skills the economy demands, and what undergraduates decide to do at university.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our system gears up swathes of the young to understand Plato's philosophical musings, but do they know how to program computers? Or even how to wash their underwear?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet computer science graduates earn a whopping five times more than those with arts degrees. Engineering graduates are also in demand, but there is a 'fingers in ears' mentality from young people, many of whom continue to take courses that are objectively pointless. Unfortunately, women are the worst offenders, with analysis in the Times Higher Education supplement showing that social studies and creative arts and design are two of their favourite subjects, and computer science and mathematics the least popular.</p><img id="i-d0cab89b3925646f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/07/00/4829524-6248335-image-a-16_1538869029264.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Union officer Sara Khan says jazz hands would encourage 'an environment of respect'. I say Sara needs to get out more" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">These choices ultimately hurt women as their average starting salary will be low – £18,000 for creative writing graduates, against a student debt that could be as much as £50,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The uptake of artsy degrees is not just an economic problem, but one that increasingly poses threats to our society. This may sound dramatic, but it is no coincidence that the rise of the 'snowflake' culture coincides with more youngsters going to university and taking up softer subjects.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Renowned Canadian professor and psychologist Jordan Peterson argues that the post-modern ideology rife in Western universities is responsible for much of the current global disharmony. Students are taught that there is no objective reality and to view the world with suspicion – as a system stacked against them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That's why, Peterson says, so many are uniting against capitalism and every other given Western society knows.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To see what Peterson is talking about, one need only dig around the PhD subject pages on the websites of prominent British universities. On one, there's a study of 'gender, class and social stratification' on golf courses, while another PhD candidate examines 'social change, and the construction of community' at a food market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The truth is, many of our universities have become like religious cults – incubators for a profoundly illiberal form of zealotry, which is why students now apply quasi-fascistic bans on things as harmless as clapping.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This social engineering, sold as inclusivity, is actually a way to identify non-believers who must be ostracised and punished in the same way that the impure were once singled out by puritanical societies.</p><img id="i-4d6ffc404894d03f" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/07/00/4829554-6248335-image-a-17_1538869118275.jpg" height="358" width="634" alt="While clapping has been deemed morally offensive by Manchester, Brighton University has decided prostitution is fine" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are other symptoms of a new puritanism among students: the rise of consent lessons, for example, at establishments such as Oxford University, where students are certainly clever enough to negotiate the nuances of sex.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These lessons are an overreaction, generally, to a minority of badly behaved men. But they also result in the genders being segregated, just as they are in intolerant religions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The cultish mindset of students is a product of a toxic combination of reduced teaching hours (my BSc in psychology offered about two hours teaching time a week in my third year), and new-age sensibilities.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Because students are left with so much free time by the majority of courses – one of our famous red-brick universities has told politics undergraduates they will be penalised if their essays are longer than 1,000 words – they have inordinate periods in which to contemplate the evils of society. It's a major reason why student culture has become so deranged and censorious.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I do not believe universities are making students cleverer, more interesting or happy.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-41b98060-c9c0-11e8-9974-fda3a82ad775">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> For many, uni is little more than a pricey creche</div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mental health problems are on the rise, with the number of first-year students reporting psychological issues now five times the level of ten years ago – and the number dropping out for these reasons trebling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In response, the Government has urged universities to prioritise mental health. At Bristol, which has seen ten suicides and sudden deaths in 18 months, the vice-chancellor has promised a team of professionals to provide round-the-clock pastoral care in halls of residence. Other universities will inevitably follow suit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I fear that doesn't address the root cause – that university might be making students feel awful in the first place. Perhaps the dropouts are the ones with the healthiest response.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, the picture is not bleak for every university, and I do not attack them all. Britain has some of the best institutions in the world – Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial College London offer a path to great careers, and are major enticers of foreign investment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is evidence that universities are responding more to the job market, with many introducing a year in industry to gear graduates up to the world of work.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And in 2020, Britain will have its first specialist engineering university, New Model in Technology and Engineering (NMITE) in Hereford. These are exactly the sort of steps we need to take in order to compete with countries such as Japan and China.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But overall I believe we need a much tougher national conversation about our universities.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For every student whose life is enhanced, I suspect there are many others for whom university is little more than an expensive creche where they figure out their life and rack up ruinous debt. Our young people – and our country – deserve better.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Almost every news story about universities is either depressing or bonkers. But mostly bonkers.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">It was one of the strongest passages in what was widely acknowledged to be the most impressive speech of her premiership. 'No one wants a good deal more than me,' <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/theresa_may/index.html" id="mol-851eb9c0-c9bf-11e8-9974-fda3a82ad775">Theresa May</a> promised her party conference, 'but that has never meant getting a deal at any cost. Britain isn't afraid to leave with no deal if we have to.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was also a lie. In reality, the Prime Minister is terrified of no deal. And so are her Cabinet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the days before shimmying on to the stage to the strains of Dancing Queen, her aides were being deployed to sing a rather different – and much bleaker – tune.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a series of private briefings with key opponents and supporters of her <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/brexit/index.html" id="mol-851fa420-c9bf-11e8-9974-fda3a82ad775">Brexit</a> strategy, the stark reality of no deal was laid bare. In the words of one senior official, it would be 'a car crash'.</p><img id="i-d1c394334cf735a1" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/06/10/4816042-0-image-a-1_1538819812852.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="In a series of private briefings with key opponents and supporters of her Brexit strategy, the stark reality of no deal was laid bare. " class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Cartwheeling out of the EU would invoke no less than 'a number of separate COBRA scenarios' – emergencies requiring the activation of the Government's civil contingencies committee. As one adviser reportedly phrased it: 'Yes, the Remainers cried wolf with Project Fear. But remember, in the end a wolf did turn up – and it ate the boy.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Which won't stop May's back-bench enemies branding such warnings as Project Fear 2.0. To their eyes, this is just a final, desperate attempt to terrorise them into dropping their opposition to Chequers. They are wrong. May's anxiety is not confected, but chillingly sincere.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not least because it is shared by most senior Ministers. Speaking to members of the Cabinet across the Brexit spectrum – from committed Remainers, through born-again Brexiteers to battle-scarred Leavers – the message is the same.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">No deal would be a political extinction-level event that would almost certainly hand the keys of No 10 to Jeremy Corbyn. 'Think back to the 2012 fuel crisis,' a Brexit-supporting Cabinet Minister explained to me. 'We would be looking at the equivalent of one of those every week for about three months. Yes, after that things would calm down. But imagine the damage that would have been done by then.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another said 'there are just too many uncertainties with no deal'. A third stated simply: 'It would be a catastrophe.' On one level, this unanimity of dread is boosting May. With the effective deadline for a deal mere days away, there is a realisation there is no longer time for leadership game-playing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We have to stand behind her now,' one Cabinet member who harbours their own prime ministerial ambitions said bluntly. 'This is about the national interest.' But there is also growing agreement that the Government will need a fall-back position in the event Chequers fails to secure the support of a hostile EU.</p><img id="i-10fae0fa864ede6" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/07/00/50D7313F00000578-6248255-Last_night_Downing_Street_cautioned_that_Theresa_May_would_not_b-a-1_1538868249190.jpg" height="1046" width="633" alt="Last night Downing Street cautioned that Theresa May would not be bounced into a Brexit deal as the European Union said an agreement was imminent. The Prime Minister is preparing to table new proposals on how to avoid a hard border before a key Brexit summit on 17 October" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">For a number of senior Ministers, this means giving the various Government departments the green-light to begin preparing the ground for a deal that comprises elements of both Chequers and a free-trade Canada model. Or, as one Government insider dubbed it, 'the Chanada option'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If we can't pull off Chequers, then we're going to need an alternative to no deal,' a Minister explained. 'But it's also going to have be something that doesn't make it look like Chequers has been completely dumped. The Prime Minister has said we need a bespoke agreement, and she can't be seen to be folding to the ERG or the EU. So Chanada may be a halfway house.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Up until now, May has been resolutely sticking to the line it is her way or the landmine-strewn no-deal highway. But Ministers believe they have started to detect a shift in her stance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In her main conference interviews, and her speech, there was no mention of the C-word. Chequers had indeed been chucked. 'She's started using the phrase 'free-trade deal' instead of 'Chequers',' a colleague noted. 'That's a positive move. And a significant one.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's a move that has come very, very late. As one Minister explains: 'You can't just pivot to a new option. If you're going for a Canada-style deal, that needs all the departments to be in alignment. There are lots of highly technical details to get across. If we want a fallback, we have to start preparing now.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The dilemma for May is the signal that would send to her negotiating partners.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any suggestion of a change in stance would be seized on by the EU as evidence of weakness. If the PM isn't seen to be standing full-square behind Chequers, what chance is there of an endorsement from Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron or Michel Barnier?</p><img id="i-db27ebcae28472c6" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/07/00/4829362-6248255-image-a-2_1538868291401.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Cartwheeling out of the EU would invoke no less than 'a number of separate COBRA scenarios' – emergencies requiring the activation of the Government's civil contingencies committee" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But in truth May is facing a simple, and much more fundamental problem. Reality has finally caught up with her. 'No deal is better than a bad deal,' was a fine soundbite, and a logical starting point for negotiations. But it was also a fiction.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, Britain can indeed leave with no deal. But not, No 10 believes, without facing a political and economic cataclysm. Gridlock, food shortages, shortages of vital medicines.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eventually each of these crisis would pass, as businesses and the markets adjusted. But they would leave permanent scars.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brexit would be forever defined and aligned in the public's mind by those eight to 12 weeks of crisis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">AS WOULD the May Government. Corbyn would point to the empty shelves, the motorways turned into trailer-parks, the RAF flights bringing emergency medical supplies, and ask: 'Would I really be worse than this?' The answer, of course, is yes. But the motorist stuck in a ten-hour petrol queue would be forgiven for thinking otherwise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And that is what Theresa May is banking on: a hope that her rebellious MPs, and some of Corbyn's more moderate backbenchers, can be persuaded at the 11th hour by the cold, hard facts of a no-deal Brexit. It's why her advisers have been despatched to present, if not quite proclaim, the truth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In her conference speech she said of no deal: 'It would be tough at first, but the resilience and ingenuity of the British people would see us through.' They would. But not, she fears, before the little boy had been devoured by the wolf.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong> Daredevil Hancock hits the skids </strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I understand that Health Secretary Matt Hancock caused a mini-crisis for British diplomats on his recent trip to China – by demanding to toboggan down the Great Wall.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We were visiting the Mutianyu section,' an aide explains, 'and they have an area where tourists can get on a trolley and slide all the way back down.

'They told us it would be better if we walked down, but Matt insisted,' the aide adds. 'He started down, but every time he got up any speed this figure in a suit would appear and slow him down.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ambassador had apparently ordered a junior official to make the ultimate sacrifice and become a human crash barrier if needed.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">All eyes in Birmingham this week were on the battle for Brexit between <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/boris_johnson/index.html" id="mol-f7d4c4b0-c8f1-11e8-b2d5-a92010c96cb4">Boris Johnson</a> and <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/theresa_may/index.html" id="mol-f7d7f900-c8f1-11e8-b2d5-a92010c96cb4">Theresa May</a>, culminating in the Prime Minister’s triumphant party conference speech.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But over the long term, I predict that Mrs May’s admired oratory will be remembered for an entirely different reason. For the most important thing the Prime Minister said — overlooked by many — was that the era of austerity, inaugurated by <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/david_cameron/index.html" id="mol-f7d58800-c8f1-11e8-b2d5-a92010c96cb4">David Cameron</a> and <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/george_osborne/index.html" id="mol-f7d62440-c8f1-11e8-b2d5-a92010c96cb4">George Osborne</a> in 2010, is over.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From now on, according to Mrs May, Britain is returning to the sunlit uplands of lavish government spending.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What a disaster!</p><img id="i-cc17758ad0698dd6" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/05/23/4810060-6246009-image-a-3_1538779619894.jpg" height="450" width="634" alt="According to Mrs May, Britain is returning to the sunlit uplands of lavish government spending" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May’s cheery announcement — undoubtedly music to the ears of millions of voters — was clever politics, because it distracted attention from the vicious internecine Tory struggle on display at the Conservative conference.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I believe that in making this statement, the PM has betrayed Conservative values and — even worse — made a strategic mistake she will soon come to regret.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her announcement is, first and foremost, an abject intellectual and moral surrender to Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell’s Labour Party. No wonder Labour is exultant. Mrs May is in effect admitting that Jeremy Corbyn was right to call for more public spending, and conversely that Chancellor Philip Hammond — and his predecessors at No. 11 — has been wrong to keep a tight grip on national finances.</p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">How incredible that a Tory leader should prefer the philosophy of her far left Labour opponent to that of her own Tory Chancellor. As far as Mr Hammond is concerned, Mrs May’s party conference speech amounts to an act of calculated financial sabotage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remember that his Budget speech on October 29 is only three weeks away. Mrs May has tied his hands, and the timing could not be worse.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let’s remember that only recently Mrs May unveiled an extra £20 billion a year for the NHS in what was cynically called a ‘Brexit health dividend’. As for her decision to allow local councils to borrow extra money to fund social housing, this is madness.</p><img id="i-3703363c605bf9b2" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/05/23/4810102-6246009-image-a-6_1538779719586.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="All eyes in Birmingham this week were on the battle for Brexit between Boris Johnson and Theresa May, culminating in the Prime Minister’s triumphant party conference speech" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, we need to build more houses. But to encourage councils to borrow the many billions of pounds that would be needed is not the right answer. Councils hardly have an unblemished record for fiscal prudence, or for the quality of the houses and flats they build.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just think of Grenfell Tower.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I fear that Mrs May’s breezy conference rhetoric will in fact unleash a flood of spending decisions which local councils lack the wherewithal to monitor properly, and for that reason could even lead to some form of financial crisis in the medium term.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Prime Minister’s announcement of the end of austerity has already led to a Whitehall battle over the spoils. Let’s take defence. Before Mrs May’s speech, Philip Hammond — I am reliably informed — had laid down the law to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson that in the current spending round not a penny extra was available to add to the £37 billion defence budget.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now Mr Williamson will ask why on earth the British armed forces can’t get their own end-of-austerity dividend, amid renewed talk of a return to Cold War with Russia.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS debate" data-version="2" id="mol-ec6e54c0-c8f0-11e8-b2d5-a92010c96cb4">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">General panic </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Anyone who doubts the gravity of the current situation needs to know this. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">It has come to my knowledge that if Mrs May is defeated in the Commons over Brexit she will not quit as Tory leader, as some speculate. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">She will call a general election, meaning that within a matter of just a few weeks, Jeremy Corbyn could be in Downing Street.</span></p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for the Prime Minister’s vote-winning freeze on fuel duty, that will add tens of billions to the debt if kept going over three years. Most significant of all, Mrs May’s call for an end to austerity will unleash furious claims for extra money from public sector workers who believe they have been victims of miserly pay awards over the past ten years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The trade unions will see Mrs May’s speech as a green light for a new round of pay awards which will cost the Exchequer a fortune.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No wonder Treasury officials were aghast as they clustered round their TV screens in Whitehall to watch Mrs May’s speech.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jeremy Corbyn might as well have delivered parts of it. Certainly it was ill-advised to talk about ‘austerity’ at all, for that is the word Labour uses for an approach to economics that Conservatives call good housekeeping and sensible finances.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So why did Mrs May use the language of the Labour Party propaganda machine? Baffling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And bonkers. Out here in the real world, it’s time to recognise that Britain has not really undergone austerity at all. Anyone who doubts this should take a look at our neighbours.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Ireland, government spending as a percentage of gross domestic product contracted from a whopping 65.1 pc in 2010 to 27.1 pc in 2016. In Britain, it fell from more than 43 pc to 40 pc over the same period. That means in real terms, taking inflation into account, it actually rose!</p><img id="i-648837e71928ea29" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/05/23/4810058-6246009-image-a-7_1538779779353.jpg" height="408" width="634" alt="Why did Mrs May use the language of the Labour Party propaganda machine? Baffling" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Left-wingers who say Britain has been scoured by ‘savage Tory cuts’ are in dreamland. They never mention the fact that British government debt has exploded from 40 pc of the gross domestic product in 2007 to an unsustainable 86 pc today. Total debt will soon surge over the once unimaginable sum of two trillion pounds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow chancellor John McDonnell couldn’t care less, of course. For them, blind political ideology has long trumped fiscal rectitude. But a Tory leader like Mrs May ought to mind desperately.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While manageable during a period of economic growth like today’s, it makes Britain vulnerable to a sudden recession or financial crisis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At this stage of the economic cycle, Britain should be running a fiscal surplus. Theresa May is now threatening to wreck that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nevertheless, I can understand why she did what she did. All governments want to be popular. It is no good being financially prudent but out of power. But her crowd-pleasing move raises a very serious question which she did not even attempt to answer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Where is the money coming from? There are only two choices, and hapless Chancellor Hammond will have to decide which it is to be in his budget, caught as he is between the Scylla of higher taxation and the Charybdis of more borrowing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I predict that he will end up going for more government borrowing, and that he’ll be forced to follow the example of his predecessor George Osborne and abandon all hope of ever bringing the national deficit into balance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The trouble is there’s an infectious illness going round Westminster. Victims suffer from a desire to put up taxes and spend large sums of public money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The consequences can be very severe, and in exceptional cases national bankruptcy can result.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Doctors have an official term for this illness: they call it ‘Corbynitis’. It is well known the leader of the Labour Party has suffered from this problem since the Seventies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We now learn he has passed on his debilitating illness to Mrs May. And over the years to come, all of us will have to pay the price.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-large">Russia's not the only superpower to fear</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the wake of this week’s espionage revelations, there is understandable alarm about the threat posed by Vladimir Putin’s Russia to Britain and Europe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I am coming to believe that the conduct of China is equally alarming. The Chinese, who will soon replace the United States of America as the world’s pre-eminent economic power, are now beginning to exert their muscle internationally. A small example of this new arrogance took place at this week’s Tory Party Conference, when a journalist from Chinese state television appeared to physically assault a volunteer at a meeting in favour of human rights in Hong Kong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead of apologising, the Chinese Embassy in London has now demanded an apology from the organisers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, Victor Mallet, the respected Financial Times correspondent in Hong Kong, has been refused an extension to his visa.

What a disaster! Mrs May’s cheery announcement — undoubtedly music to the ears of millions of voters — was clever politics, because it distracted attention from the vicious internecine Tory struggle on display at the Conservative conference. But I believe that in making this statement, the PM has betrayed Conservative values and — even worse — made a strategic mistake she will soon come to regret.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Peter Oborne For The Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-06T10:31:39.000+02:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>PETER OBORNE: May's caught Corbynitis - and we're all going to pay </mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-06T10:31:39.000+02:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/05/23/4810060-0-image-a-10_1538780016031.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1104735</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>AP</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6237985/PETER-OBORNE-Yes-great-challenges-ahead-Mrs-finally-PM-power.html" title="PETER OBORNE: Yes, there are great challenges ahead but Mrs May is finally becoming a PM not just in name - but in power "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6233307/PETER-OBORNE-Johnson-incoherent-glib-hit-back.html" title="PETER OBORNE: Johnson was incoherent and glib but May has to hit back "></link></item><item><title>DAILY MAIL COMMENT: Unilever and a great victory for UK plc</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6245951/DAILY-MAIL-COMMENT-Unilever-great-victory-UK-plc.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Oct 2018 22:28:43 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6245951</guid><description><![CDATA[The decision of consumer goods giant Unilever to abandon plans for the relocation of its corporate headquarters from London to Rotterdam is a spectacular victory on every conceivable level.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

But it would also have made the firm’s shares far less attractive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Britain has vastly greater inward investment than any other European country and infinitely more dynamic financial markets. For Unilever to turn its back on that would have been an act of insane self-harm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would also have forced large British investors including pension funds which track the FTSE 100 to sell their shares, disadvantaging countless ordinary savers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So the dramatic U-turn, while crushing for the board, is a huge relief to everyone else.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Above all perhaps, this has been a great victory for the reputation of UK plc. With Brexit approaching, it provides a welcome reminder that Britain is still the country where the world wants to do business.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>No deal, no money</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, could it be that we are inching slowly towards a Brexit trade deal? Irish premier Leo Varadkar – previously so pessimistic about the progress of negotiations – now says an agreement could be reached ‘within two weeks’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And arch-Eurosceptic minister Liam Fox gave tacit support to the Chequers plan by saying any flaws could be ‘revised later’.</p><img id="i-81a7f711473d9460" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/05/23/06087F86000007D0-6245951-image-a-18_1538777942240.jpg" height="387" width="634" alt="Irish premier Leo Varadkar – previously so pessimistic about the progress of negotiations – now says an agreement could be reached ‘within two weeks’" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, the devil will be in the detail and there are many hurdles to negotiate yet. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the meantime, Theresa May should refuse to hand over any of the £39billion divorce bill until a comprehensive agreement is reached. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brussels is desperate to get its hands on this huge tranche of cash.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The grass is immaculate, mown in straight lines to a Wimbledon-standard finish.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s odd to think of this vast tract of lawn — nearly half a mile long and 50 yards wide — as a sea of red. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet that was the scene which drew the Queen, the Royal Family, politicians, celebrities and five million members of the public to this spot four years ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The poppies at the Tower of <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-b164fcb0-c8ed-11e8-ae97-5763eab121a0">London</a> proved to be one of the most powerful and popular pieces of contemporary art this country has ever seen when they filled the great moat in 2014 to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the Great War.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what on earth is the Tower going to do by way of an encore as we approach November 11 and the centenary of the Armistice of 1918?</p><img id="i-e2ab52da33674c42" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/05/22/4809188-6245903-image-a-1_1538776632922.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The poppies at the Tower of London proved to be one of the most powerful and popular pieces of contemporary art this country has ever seen when they filled the great moat in 2014 to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the Great War" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is about to be another show in the moat. However, things are going to be very different this time. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And let us hope that, on this occasion, the Government, the arts establishment, the Left and the critics rally round this admirable tribute to the fallen, unlike 2014. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back then, they either ignored or mocked the poppies, only embracing them when they belatedly woke up to the depth of public feeling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have no doubt the public will be back in great numbers, as contemplative and respectful as before. </p><div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But next month it will not be poppies at the centre of this vast commemorative exercise but flames.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, from next Tuesday, Daily Mail readers will have the chance to play a very special part in the proceedings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was back in the summer of 2014 that artist Paul Cummins started planting 888,246 ceramic poppies in the moat around our most famous fortress — one for every soldier who died for King and country in World War I. He called the installation Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red.</p><img id="i-a7050b7abaac247" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/05/22/4809182-6245903-image-a-2_1538776644306.jpg" height="406" width="634" alt="By the time the last poppy went into the ground on Remembrance Sunday, more than 20,000 volunteers had helped the project’s designer, Tom Piper, to install a display which, for days on end, brought the streets around the Tower to a silent, tearful standstill" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">As more poppies appeared, so the crowds grew, too, along with the number of volunteers wanting to help. This stunning depiction of a lost generation struck an instant chord with much of the country.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By the time the last poppy went into the ground on Remembrance Sunday, more than 20,000 volunteers had helped the project’s designer, Tom Piper, to install a display which, for days on end, brought the streets around the Tower to a silent, tearful standstill.</p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">There was also a short twilight ceremony each night as the Last Post was played and a guest speaker stood amid the poppies reciting names from the Roll of Honour. The names — 180 each night — were nominated in advance by the public.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On one evening, an entire village from Derbyshire turned up to hear a list of local lads read out. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">People flew from Australia and Canada just to be present when a kinsman was being honoured. Everyone wanted to be involved.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One night, the organisers invited Helen Mirren to do the honours. Oscar-winning actress she might be but even her voice cracked at times.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The only sour note was that those bodies charged with supporting the arts — including the National Lottery — failed to see any merit in the idea. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The artist had to take out a high-interest loan to underwrite his brilliant idea, while the Tower’s appeals for help from all our main arts organisations were rejected.</p><div class="item">
    

</div>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">There will be no need for that this time, for generous backers have come forward to support what should be a very fitting conclusion to four years of national commemorations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During that time, we have seen poignant parades and services right across the World War I battlefront led by the Royal Family, ministers and Royal British Legion standard-bearers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From Mons to the Somme and Vimy, from the North Sea ceremonies to mark the Battle of Jutland, to a heartbreaking service in memory of the staff and pupils of an East End primary school killed in 1917 during London’s first daylight bombing raid, Britain has faithfully honoured the memory of a noble generation who are no longer with us.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now comes the final episode in this great commemorative undertaking, with a series of events planned for next month. Historic Royal Palaces, the charity which runs the Tower of London, has once again teamed up with poppies designer Tom Piper to create a fresh work called Beyond The Deepening Shadow: The Tower Remembers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But whereas the poppies sought to convey monumental loss and sacrifice, this display will be about remembrance — but also forward-looking, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the outbreak of war, the Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey grimly declared that ‘the lamps are going out all over Europe’. From November 4, on successive nights until November 11 itself, we will see them slowly come back on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unlike the poppies, this is an idea which has evolved from a long series of collective discussions between the Tower staff and their advisers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Spread throughout the moat of the Tower, roughly three feet apart and at various heights, will be 10,000 torches. The precise number has no particular significance and will simply be determined by the surface area of the moat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As with the poppies, no one knows for sure what it will look like until it actually happens.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The power of this piece will be in the creeping wall of flame as it gradually spreads out until the whole moat is ablaze, while a choral tribute plays throughout. It will begin each evening at 5pm as the Tower is cast in to darkness and a lone bugler plays the Last Post. Then comes what Tom Piper calls the ‘ignition’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This, he explains, is as much a part of the spectacle as the end result. ‘It will have a strong dramatic element,’ says the award-winning theatre designer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Led by the Yeomen Warders of the Tower in their traditional Tudor ‘Beefeater’ uniforms, a team of 80 volunteers will move outwards from the walls armed with wand-like zappers and begin lighting the torches one by one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We are not talking tea lights. Each will produce a deep orange flame up to a foot tall from a canister the size of a small paint pot.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘One of the things people found most appealing about the poppies was watching the volunteers planting them,’ Tom Piper tells me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the same time, the specially commissioned choral work will ring out from loudspeakers stretching the length of the moat. Each torch will have enough (alcohol-based) fuel to last precisely four hours in all weathers, whereupon the flames will cease at around 9pm and the Tower will flick the lights back on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As in 2014, large crowds are expected. This time, however, a few lucky members of the public can actually immerse themselves in the display.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A limited number of tickets are on sale (for just £5 each), allowing people to enter the moat and walk along a path through this sea of fire from one end to the other — at a safe distance, of course.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The health and safety manual for this event is this big!’ exclaims Commander Debra Whittingham, the Deputy Governor of the Tower, stretching her arms wide. A former Royal Navy officer and the first female Deputy Governor in the Tower’s 1,000-year history, Commander Whittingham is in charge of all the practicalities.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her duties extend to deciding on the clothing the volunteer torch-lighters must wear each night. Thankfully, the commander has already vetoed one inevitable demand. Whatever the health and safety commissars may say, there will be no hi-viz jackets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We want people dressed appropriately,’ she says, adding that a range of dark, weatherproof, flame-retardant kit is being sorted out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She is seeking a pool of 300 volunteers to be part of the torch-lighting programme, and a further 300 to help replenish all the torches the following morning. After the poppy experience, there should be a stampede.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for the Yeomen Warders, they are very much looking forward to taking part.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It will be in our own time, so we have asked for volunteers and everyone wants to be part of it,’ says Yeoman Gaoler (second-in-command) Bob Loughlin MBE, 63. He joined the Beefeaters at the Tower after 36 years in the RAF Regiment, and well remembers being on duty here during the poppy saga.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most of all, he recalls the evening when he was picked to read out the roll of honour. ‘It was just astonishing to hear people in the crowd crying as I was reading out the names,’ he recalls.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I suggest that some people will, inevitably, be concerned for the ravens. Might not the sudden appearance of ten thousand flames be enough to drive these famous residents away — and thus spell doom for the Tower, the Crown and the nation, as legend foretells?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Don’t worry, the ravens will all be safely tucked up in bed by then,’ Bob assures me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is still much planning to do. Eva Koch-Schulte, creative producer for all the Historic Royal Palaces is presently working out the shape and timings of the torch procession.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It is all about light seeping out from the shadows and that sense of shared sacrifice,’ explains German-born Eva, who has commissioned composer and artist Mira Calix to create the music.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like the title of the display, the words of the choral piece will be based on Sonnets To A Soldier by Mary Borden, a war poet and nurse on the Western Front during World War I who went on to run an ambulance service in World War II.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are going to be major events all over Britain to mark the centenary of the Armistice, including a ‘people’s parade’ at the Cenotaph, and a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey involving the Royal Family and (almost certainly) the President of Germany.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the blazing moat at the Tower will surely be among the most memorable tributes. And this display will also be less financially precarious than the 2014 poppy show. It seems astonishing now, but Paul Cummins risked bankruptcy to create that dazzling Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The National Lottery, so ready to toss money at any modish tat masquerading as culture, had refused to cough up a bean towards the Tower’s costs. Ditto the Arts Council.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps, if Cummins had said he wanted to create a sea of white flags or a giant Tracey Emin bed, it might have found some cash. He might even have been nominated for the Turner Prize.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But no. His war-themed work was not worthy of public funding. For good measure, a Guardian columnist weighed in and attacked it as a ‘Ukip-style memorial’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So Cummins had to take out a hefty loan to get it all off the ground and pay for a ceramic production line, using unemployed youngsters in Derby.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Historic Royal Palaces (which runs the Tower without a penny of public money), agreed to foot the bill for crowd control and logistics. Yet when the time came to take the display down, there was an outcry. The public wanted ‘their’ poppies to stay. So, a compromise was found.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To recoup his costs, Cummins sold the poppies for £25 each, with any profit going to charity. Such was the demand that they generated a whopping £9.5 million for good causes.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox debate floatRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-c32a2d50-c909-11e8-9529-5f8b614b97b2">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Fifty pairs of tickets to be won  </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">The Mail is honoured to have 50 pairs of tickets to Beyond The Deepening Shadow at the Tower of London to give away to worthy nominees.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The winners will get the chance to be there as the Yeomen Warders light the first torches of the evening.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They will then be able to walk through the displays as it comes to life, accompanied by the stunning new choral music based on the work of the poet Mary Borden, before standing back to admire the sight of the whole moat ablaze.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It promises to be a spectacular and emotional experience as we commemorate a century since the end of the Great War and honour the memory of those who gave their lives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Entries are not yet open, but full details on how to nominate someone who deserves to take part in this unique and deeply moving event will be published in Tuesday's Daily Mail.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">A group of philanthropists also bought the two most dramatic aspects of his display — ‘Wave’ and ‘Weeping Window’, the two great arches of poppies — and gave them to the nation in perpetuity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The then Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, produced a further £2 million to take these two displays on tour around the United Kingdom.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They have enjoyed astonishing success, with a further 4.5 million people coming to see them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tom Piper has spent much of the past four years touring the country re-erecting the poppies at regional sites, and has been bowled over by the reaction to them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was particularly touched when he took them to Caernarfon Castle where his great-uncle, Lieutenant Arthur Griffiths, is among the thousands of gallant Welshmen listed in the Roll of Honour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I felt this very powerful connection,’ he says. ‘It left me very proud and very moved.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He tells me how Newcastle’s Woodhorn mining museum enjoyed a 1,500 per cent increase in visitors when the poppies went on show there. And so it continues.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This weekend, Weeping Window has gone on display at the Imperial War Museum in London, while Wave is on show at the IWM North in Manchester.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Four years on, Poppy Power is undiminished. The judges of contemporary art’s increasingly ludicrous and tawdry Turner Prize might continue to ignore Cummins.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet, it is a measure of the enduring — almost sacred — status of his work that, to this day, you will not find a single one of those 888,246 original ceramic poppies on eBay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fortunately, funding for the flames is already in place.
