I recently learned that, on the first day of commemoration, in 1919, the silence was often far from silent. In many places, when the traffic and the factories stopped, the sound of uncontrollable weeping could be heard in many towns. Nearly three quarters of a million young men had died far away. In an age when death was still marked by elaborate rituals of mourning, they’d had no funerals.

She appeared no fewer than five times in the first 15 minutes and it was she who had the last word, finishing the programme by describing the caring, lighter side of Charles she would like us all to see. She came across as his standard bearer, extolling his virtues with becoming humour in that husky ex-smoker’s voice of hers. Whether she was shown jollying him up on a tedious foreign tour or describing him playing with her grandchildren, this was not so much about our future King but, whisper it, our future Queen. I have been one of Camilla’s fiercest critics, not least about the way in which she and Charles betrayed Diana.

For the immediate future at least, we stay on as a member of the European customs union. Britain has also agreed to the controversial Northern Irish ‘backstop’. This means that we will remain as part of the customs arrangement — and therefore subject to European courts — until such time as a trading arrangement with Europe is agreed. Perhaps, and this is the fear of the Brexiteers, it is where we will remain for ever. Such is the deal that Theresa May has fought for. It’s the deal which big business has argued for. She believes it will protect British jobs and prosperity. It should be seen as a personal triumph for the Prime Minister. But it’s also a deal which represents many thing those who sought a clean break from Europe fought against. So expect cries of betrayal. Not just from Nigel Farage, either. We should also expect an eruption in the Conservative Party.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Peter Oborne For The Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-11-10T00:15:02.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>PETER OBORNE: Mrs May’s deal could spark a Tory eruption</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-11-10T00:15:02.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6372857/The-Johnson-family-feud-Brexit-finally-healed.html" title="'United in dismay': How the resignation of Boris's 'quieter and cleverer' Remainer younger brother Jo could end bitter feud that has split the famous Johnson family"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6373771/ROBERT-HARDMAN-Sombre-silent-Theresa-pays-tribute-fallen.html" title="ROBERT HARDMAN: Sombre and silent, Theresa May pays tribute to the fallen as the as the Prime Minister marks the centenary of Armistice Day"></link></item><item><title>TOM UTLEY: My very embarrassed prep school head and why I pity any teacher who has to give orgasm lessons to giggling girls (as Labour MP Jess Phillips suggests) </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6370285/TOM-UTLEY-pity-teacher-orgasm-lessons-giggling-girls.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Nov 2018 01:45:03 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6370285</guid><description><![CDATA[Labour MP Jess Phillips has demanded that girls should be taught about orgasms during sex education lessons at school.

Mr Khan is pinning his hopes on a ‘public health approach’ that has been tried out in Glasgow, where the murder rate has halved since 2005. However, the Mayor of London says it could take ten years to cut crime. However, his critics have savaged him, pointing out his many overseas trips and red-carpet appearances as evidence that he wasn’t tackling the critical issue (pictured).</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Stephen Glover for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-11-08T00:21:03.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>STEPHEN GLOVER: Ten years to beat knife crime, Mr Khan?</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-11-08T00:21:03.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6364989/Roald-Rotten-disturbing-secrets-unstoppable-lothario-penchant-cruelty.html" title="Roald the Rotten!

But like many an eagerly anticipated return, things didn’t go quite according to plan. And that’s not just because of the crowd on opening night, still protesting at the Tricycle Theatre’s unwelcome rebranding as ‘the Kiln’. Smith’s book is a Dickensian soap opera covering nearly 50 years and Steven Sharkey’s plucky adaptation never really finds a motor for her multi-cultural bunfight. He’s obviously torn his hair out trying to find a way of staging the sprawling novel, and with the Kiln’s boss Indhu Rubasingham directing, the answer has been to create a brand new heroine. She takes the shape of Rosie Jones, a young woman trying to find out who her father is after she’s put into a coma by a patient at her dental practice – a set-up that’s at least in keeping with Smith’s own comic whimsy.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Patrick Marmion for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-11-07T01:57:34.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>PATRICK MARMION reviews White Teeth at London's Kiln Theatre</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-11-07T01:57:34.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6360315/Dine-dash-queen-faces-jail-time-walking-22-50-bill-croissant-mojito.html" title="'Dine-and-dash queen' who made headlines after angry restaurant owners posted her picture online faces jail time after 'walking out on a $22.50 bill for a croissant and a mojito'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6357691/Sweet-toothed-customers-slam-Fantastical-Chocolate-Festival.html" title="Furious chocolate lovers are left with bitter taste: 'Poorly-run, hideously overpriced' £17-a-head Fantastical Chocolate Festival 'wasn't fantastic... and didn't have much chocolate' "></link></item><item><title>QUENTIN LETTS: Hired-grief Phil is like a man chewing soft cabbage in Treasury Questions </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6361153/QUENTIN-LETTS-Hired-grief-Phil-like-man-chewing-soft-cabbage-Treasury-Questions.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Nov 2018 01:34:56 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6361153</guid><description><![CDATA[While Matt Hancock leapt about the place, yelped, whacked the despatch box and created a sense of occasion, the Chancellor Philip Hammond presides over Questions with mournful detachment.]]></description><content:encoded></content:encoded><dc:abstract>While Matt Hancock leapt about the place, yelped, whacked the despatch box and created a sense of occasion, the Chancellor Philip Hammond presides over Questions with mournful detachment.

It was a characteristically weak and defeatist response from a man who seems to be doing everything to exonerate himself from responsibility in this matter. The scale and the urgency of the crisis (pictured left floral tributes are left for 15-year-old Jay Hughes stabbed to death last Thursday) appear to have eluded a mayor more at home posing for virtue-signalling selfies than attending to the wounds that are staining his city’s streets with the blood of its young.

It is about the people they have failed.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Peter Hitchens for The Mail on Sunday</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-11-04T01:44:40.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>PETER HITCHENS: If moaning cut crime we'd have best police in world</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-11-04T01:44:40.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6349187/Schizophrenic-South-African-raped-pensioner-putting-bins.html" title="Mentally-ill man, 22, raped pensioner as she put out her bins then fled with her dead husband's ashes while police hunted him over separate attack on Cambridge student "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6345317/Nearly-70-THOUSAND-children-wounded-one-year-attacks-Wild-West-Britain.html" title="Violence in 'Wild West' Britain has led to 69,000 children being wounded amid a 'constant torrent' of murders and knife attacks "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/" title="Mail Online - Peter Hitchens blog"></link></item><item><title>PETER OBORNE: I voted for Brexit, but claims of Russian influence are deeply troubling</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6348317/PETER-OBORNE-voted-Brexit-claims-Russian-influence-deeply-troubling.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Nov 2018 00:31:03 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6348317</guid><description><![CDATA[Let’s imagine that rumours emerged that Labour’s biggest political donor was not what he seemed.

And let’s also imagine that soon afterwards rumours emerged that Labour’s biggest political donor was not what he seemed. And that the real source of the money was none other than Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin.

William Sitwell was responding to a dreary email from a freelance journalist who had suggested a series about ‘plant-based meals’. Mr Sitwell’s brisk response was “how about a column called The Honest Vegan, a millennial’s diary of earnest endeavour and bacon sandwiches…” Selene Nelson was mightily offended and so were the bosses at Waitrose, who said his words were ‘extremely inappropriate and insensitive’. As a result, Sitwell is eating a massive slice of Waitrose’s best artisanal humble pie, apologising profusely, issuing a grovelling statement claiming to ‘love and respect people of all appetites, be they vegan, vegetarian or meat eaters’.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Janet Street-Porter For Mailonline</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-11-01T11:04:26.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>If you can’t take a joke you shouldn’t have joined the human race</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-11-01T11:04:26.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>MSN Push</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6335477/Meghan-Markle-Prince-Harry-arrive-Rotorua-final-day-marathon-royal-tour.html" title="Meghan Markle wears a traditional Maori cloak made from pheasant feathers to protect her during pregnancy as she and Prince Harry begin the final day of their marathon royal tour"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6335277/Secret-plan-make-Charles-Prince-Regent-three-years.html" title="Arise the Shadow King!

He relaxed the iron grip of austerity and many of us will soon be feeling a little richer as a result. And about time too, after ten long years when incomes have stayed put or fallen in real terms.

MRS MAY SAYS: Let me be perfectly straightforward, Susan. It’s right at this stage that the British people should have the choice between, on the one hand, a cardigan, with its buttons down the middle, and, on the other, a pullover, with either no buttons at all, or a basic minimum of buttons, supplemented by a hole at the top, for the head to go through. But there is, of course, a third option, The Pulligan. This combines the very best of, on the one hand, the cardigan and, on the other, the pullover. As we have explained in numerous discussion documents, The Pulligan has no buttons, but does away with the burden of a hole at the top.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Craig Brown for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-23T06:32:59.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>CRAIG BROWN imagines Theresa May answering all your travel questions</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-23T06:32:59.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6288751/CRAIG-BROWN-ponders-ones-castle-tidy-2.html" title="Top tips for candles - and fork handles!

And Britain is far weaker than the giant German empire that is the EU. Sooner or later, if we truly want to get out of that empire, we are going to have to grasp this. Poor, hopeless Theresa May hasn’t a chance, not least because she has never really wanted to leave. So she flounders between wild fake militancy, adopted to protect her right flank, and pathetic weakness – her actual position. But I have even less time for the posturing braggarts, on all sides of the question, who now pretend that their positions are so pure and wonderful that they cannot give an inch.

After initial laughter at the caricature greediness, two immediate thoughts: is Facebook really sure it wants to be represented by such a slippery hypocrite? And what about Clegg’s British political allies, who may be feeling distinctly sore at his Yankee volte-face? Facebook has hired him for his EU contacts – he was once a Brussels official and an MEP.

Yet EU hardliners such as Macron and the arch-federalists in Brussels keep throwing it back in her face. Why? Because some, like Macron, beset by plummeting popularity ratings, want to show their home audience that they are tough on the treacherous Brits. It is also because they are deploying a dangerous strategy: the tougher the deal, the more likely (so the theory goes) that Britain will be pushed into holding a second referendum.

How can I survive? How can I claim some credit? How can I say, ‘See, I was right all along’? For politicians it is the desire to get one over opponents in the House and enemies in their own parties.

Fewer and fewer clothes shops have individual changing-rooms. Sports clubs and ‘leisure centres’ no longer offer the timid and the paranoid a place to change by themselves, away from prying eyes. Even the act of reading has become a group activity, leading to a boom in book clubs and literary festivals. Now it looks as though the GP’s consulting room, once so private and personal, is set to turn into a hive of group activity. Most of us dread a doctor in hospital saying, ‘Would you mind if we were joined by a student?’ But now there is news of people being asked to share their appointments with up to 14 other patients. A GP who runs one of these group sessions, Dr Emily Symington, says: ‘If we are going to start to address the tide of lifestyle conditions and long-term conditions, we need to start thinking about how we do things differently. Group consultations have started to address that. It is putting people in control.’</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Craig Brown for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-09T00:57:19.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>As doctors try group appointments, CRAIG BROWN says 'No, I do mind'</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-09T00:57:19.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content></item><item><title>RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: Labour's four-day week pledge?

So how reliable are claims of a ‘growing dossier’ against the PM? Brady, the soul of discretion, never talks about the leadership election process, but he has now given a mischievous hint of what’s really going on. Speaking at a conference event held by think-tank the Centre for Social Justice, he suggested that the ‘difference between what colleagues say they might have done and what they have done can be considerable’.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Andrew Pierce for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-08T01:21:52.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>ANDREW PIERCE: Will anti-May Tory MPs ever put the boot in?</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-08T01:21:52.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content></item><item><title>PETER OBORNE: May's attempts to win-over disaffected Labour voters was political cross dressing that would make Blair proud</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6250371/Mays-attempts-win-Labour-voters-political-cross-dressing-make-Blair-proud.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Oct 2018 23:45:42 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6250371</guid><description><![CDATA[At first sight it looks a brilliant stroke by Theresa May.

Writing in the Left-wing Observer newspaper, she launched a direct appeal to disillusioned Labour voters. Her Tory Party, claims the Prime Minister, is the natural home for traditional Labour supporters horrified by Jeremy Corbyn’s lurch to the Left. ‘I want voters who may previously have thought of themselves as Labour supporters to look at my government afresh,’ wrote Mrs May. ‘They will find a decent, moderate and patriotic programme that is worthy of their support.’ How fascinating. How audacious. And how very revealing. First and foremost, this latest manoeuvre is an indication that Mrs May is preparing for the possibility of having to fight an emergency general election in just a few weeks’ time.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Peter Oborne For The Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-08T09:59:20.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>May's attempts to win-over Labour voters political cross dressing</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-08T09:59:20.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6249767/20-people-killed-New-York-limo-crash-way-wedding.html" title="'How do you go on when four of your daughters die?'

But I believe that in making this statement, the PM has betrayed Conservative values and — even worse — made a strategic mistake she will soon come to regret.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Peter Oborne For The Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-06T08:31:39.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>PETER OBORNE: May's caught Corbynitis - and we're all going to pay </mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-06T08:31:39.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6237985/PETER-OBORNE-Yes-great-challenges-ahead-Mrs-finally-PM-power.html" title="PETER OBORNE: Yes, there are great challenges ahead but Mrs May is finally becoming a PM not just in name - but in power "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6233307/PETER-OBORNE-Johnson-incoherent-glib-hit-back.html" title="PETER OBORNE: Johnson was incoherent and glib but May has to hit back "></link></item><item><title>DAILY MAIL COMMENT: Unilever and a great victory for UK plc</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6245951/DAILY-MAIL-COMMENT-Unilever-great-victory-UK-plc.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Oct 2018 22:28:43 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6245951</guid><description><![CDATA[The decision of consumer goods giant Unilever to abandon plans for the relocation of its corporate headquarters from London to Rotterdam is a spectacular victory on every conceivable level.]]></description><content:encoded></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The decision of consumer goods giant Unilever to abandon plans for the relocation of its corporate headquarters from London to Rotterdam is a spectacular victory on almost every conceivable level. It’s a victory for shareholders, who rose in furious rebellion against the Unilever board’s ill-considered proposal and have now succeeded in thwarting it. It’s a victory for the City of London, confirming once again its position as Europe’s undisputed financial hub. And it’s a victory for the Daily Mail, which has highlighted the deep folly of this plan from day one, campaigned passionately to kill it off, and helped give an estimated 35,000 small investors in the firm a voice they would not otherwise have had.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Daily Mail Comment</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-06T01:48:14.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>DAILY MAIL COMMENT: Unilever and a great victory for UK plc</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-06T01:48:14.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content></item><item><title>Why the new Tower tribute will set your heart ablaze: Four years after that profoundly emotional sea of poppies, a fiery new spectacle will mark a century since the end of the Great War </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6245903/Fiery-new-spectacle-mark-century-end-Great-War.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Oct 2018 22:26:24 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6245903</guid><description><![CDATA[The grass is immaculate, mown in straight lines to a Wimbledon-standard finish.

It was the speech in which she struck all the right notes to unite the warring factions in her party. At the same time, the Prime Minister displayed a human side and a self-deprecating sense of humour that endeared her to an audience previously inclined to write her off as a hard-to-love automaton and a bit of a bore. If the pundits are to be believed, it was also the speech that changed the political landscape. For not only did it put Boris Johnson in his place and make other challengers for the leadership think again (for the moment, at least). It also set out perhaps the clearest appeal in the Conservatives’ history for the support of people who would hitherto never have dreamed of voting anything but Labour. Her message was unmistakable: if you’re appalled by Jeremy Corbyn’s ugly and destructive extremism, and searching for a party that’s ‘decent, moderate and patriotic’, then the Conservatives under her leadership are the party for you.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Tom Utley for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-10-05T11:14:39.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>I’ve a word or two to say about real star of Theresa May’s performance</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-10-05T11:14:39.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Theresa May</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6241913/Teri-Hatcher-recalls-molested-child-tells-Trump-wrong-mock-Christine-Ford.html" title="'Do not add mocked by the president to the injury list of a sexual survivor': Teri Hatcher reveals she was molested as a child in open letter to Trump, telling him it's 'plain wrong' to ridicule Christine Ford"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6241663/The-five-key-steps-catching-hapless-beer-guzzling-GRU-spies-face-global-humiliation.html" title="Caught red handed: The five key steps to catching the hapless, beer-guzzling GRU spies who now face global humiliation after bungling their mission from the Kremlin "></link></item><item><title>'No-deal?
