</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">For a while, Warner managed to convince even himself that his 'Bull' persona — the bundle of venom who regarded no sledge as too contemptible — was a thing of the past.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After marrying Candice Falzon, a former professional ironwoman, in 2015 and becoming a father, he seemed to mellow. He stopped drinking, and his wife introduced him to John Novak, a mind coach. In turn, Novak introduced Warner to mindfulness — the western world's adaptation of Buddhism's search for inner calm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It appeared to do the trick. Warner would deal with stick by telling himself three positive things about his critic. He adopted preacher-like poses to celebrate his centuries. In 2016, he was named Australia's Sporting Father of the Year. He scored runs for fun, especially in one-day cricket.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I don't know where they've taken the old Davey Warner,' said a team-mate. 'But I quite like this new version.' </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Warner and captain Steve Smith are set to be banned after the recent ball-tampering scandal</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The media happily bought into the transformation. Here was the definitive Aussie larrikin, who had stacked shelves at Woolworths as a teenager, paid off his parents' credit card bills, and overcome some hairy moments — including an infamous punch thrown at Joe Root in a Birmingham bar in 2013 — to rise to the Test vice-captaincy. What was not to like?</p><div class="mol-img-group floatRHS mol-hidden-caption" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The boys call me the Rev now because they reckon the Bull's been tamed a little bit,' he said.

The rules are in place for a reason. If you're not going to use them, why bother having them?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The sermon has not aged well. </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

  </div>

</div>    </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Worse, the Bull has since had other ideas. <span class="mol-style-italic">Sportsmail </span>revealed on Monday that Warner told England players at an end-of-series drinks party how he had used a bandage on his hand to rough up the ball during the Ashes and help Australia's bowlers achieve reverse swing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And Cricket Australia's investigation into the events that led to opening batsman Cameron Bancroft shoving an incriminating piece of sticky tape down his trousers in Cape Town, and captain Steve Smith admitting to cheating, is sure to focus on Warner's role in the fiasco. A ban seems inevitable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet the signs were already there that the Reverend's halo had begun to slip. Ahead of the Ashes, Warner went full Bull, saying: 'As soon as you step on that line it's war. You try and get into a battle as quick as you can. I try and look in the opposition's eyes and try and work out, 'How can I dislike this player? How can I get on top of him?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You have to delve and dig deep into yourself to actually get some hatred about them to actually get up when you're out there.' </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

  </div>

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Sportsmail revealed Warner told England players he roughed-up the ball during the Ashes</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Warner was true to his word, leading the personal abuse aimed at Jonny Bairstow and generally rubbing England up the wrong way. This was the Warner of old, a character so addicted to nastiness that his abuse of a Test team-mate in an Australian domestic match once persuaded the victim not to shake his hand at the end of the game — cricket's ultimate snub.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Candice deserved all the sympathy she got when her past was used as sledging material by South African players and fans. The trouble was, no one had any sympathy for her husband.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The reason was summed up by Gilchrist. 'All his team-mates are saying, 'The Reverend's gone, Bull's back'. It's always a worry when someone is so extreme in one direction or the other. I think Davey's got to find somewhere in between that.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If Australia's board, who stood him down from the vice- captaincy during the Cape Town Test, impose further sanctions, Warner will have plenty of time to consider his options.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Getting a decent nickname will be the least of his problems.</p><div>

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Experience</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The two men are at relatively similar stages of their respective careers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Parker, a world champion with 24 fights and 24 wins, 18 of those by knockout. Joshua, a world champion with 20 fights and 20 wins, all coming by knockout. But when it comes to a comparison there is one name that sets the two fighters apart.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Joshua’s stunning victory over Wladimir Klitschko was seen as a passing of the torch moment for a division that the Ukrainian dominated for over 10 years. Parker has more rounds under his belt but has never beaten someone on the level of Klitschko nor fought on a stage like this one. When it comes to the one man both have faced, Carlos Takam, neither shone but Joshua secured a stoppage while Parker was taken all the way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Parker is still waiting for his breakout fight, Joshua has had his. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Joshua: 7.5/10 </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Parker: 6.5/10 </strong></p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

Parker has 18 KOs to his name so there's no doubt he has power in his hands but what can’t be ignored is the fact the Kiwi has failed to finish any of his three fights since stepping up to world level. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Taken the distance by Hughie Fury, Razvan Cojanu, Ruiz and Takam not long before that, Parker's power is nothing special at the top end of the division. The same can't be said for his big-punching adversary, who has toppled all 20 of his opponents since turning pro. Joshua maintained that record with his controversial 10th-round stoppage of Takam in October and while he does not possess the one-punch knockout power of Deontay Wilder, there is only so many clean shots anyone standing across the ring from the Brit can handle. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Joshua: ‪9/10 </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Parker: ‪7/10 </strong></p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

The 25-year-old has proven that he can take a punch as good as anyone. The New Zealander has never been dropped and never even been wobbled despite being caught flush on a number of occasions. Joshua, meanwhile, has long been linked with a suspect chin with tales of his sparring troubles having circulated the boxing world for years. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniel Dubois and fellow British Olympian David Price have both knocked down the Brit in the gym. The 28-year-old was also rocked badly by British rival Dillian Whyte in the second round of their grudge match and sent to the canvas when Klitschko landed a straight right hand during their clash at Wembley. Whether Parker has the power to capitalise is another question. </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

The WBO champion’s defence is leaky and his lack of head movement sees him get caught regularly whenever the opponent applies real pressure. In his last outing against Fury, one many argue he lost, the 26-year-old ate plenty of shots while Takam was also able to land numerous times when they met. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Joshua, who fights in a more cautious style, has good defensive awareness with his right hand up protecting his chin while also using his lead hand to parry his opponent’s jab and measure distance. The Englishman is liable to getting dragged into a war, however, and when he does he leaves himself open to sharp counters that Parker could take advantage of. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Joshua: 8/10 </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Parker: 6/10</strong></p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

But his finish smacked the post.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wales were lucky again when Ashley Williams failed to get a pass-back to Wayne Hennessey and put Suarez clear.

Cavani marked his 100th cap by striking early in the second half as Uruguay sliced through a lapsed defence and showed the strides Wales need to make when the competitive action begins for Giggs. Gareth Bale will need to play better too if Wales are to reach Euro 2020 although Giggs defended his talisman by arguing Oscar Tabarez's side worked in packs to limit his threat.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>James Dutton</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T06:28:55.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Wales 0-1 Uruguay: Edinson Cavani settles China Cup final</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T06:28:55.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Uruguay Football,Wales Football</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5544209/Wales-vs-Uruguay-China-Cup-final-LIVE-Follow-action.html" title="Wales 0-1 Uruguay, China Cup final RESULT: Edinson Cavani goal denies Gareth Bale and Co in Nanning"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5544589/Swansea-ready-sign-Andy-King-Leicester.html" title="Swansea 'ready to sign Andy King on a permanent deal from Leicester' if they avoid Premier League relegation"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5543025/Bale-admits-Chinese-Super-League-switch-tempting-amid-fears-Real-Madrid-future.html" title="Wales star Gareth Bale admits Chinese Super League switch is tempting amid fears around his Real Madrid future: 'I'm sure that if I ever did come I'll be looked after very well'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5542487/Wales-star-Gareth-Bale-targets-2022-World-Cup.html" title="Wales star Gareth Bale targets 2022 World Cup as he admits missing out on Russia was a 'massive disappointment'"></link></item><item><title>Premier League transfer fees may be crazy but the original big spenders were Italian clubs in the 90s - from £13m Gianluigi Lentini to £35m Hernan Crespo (and Christian Vieri's nine clubs in nine years!)</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5545675/Meet-original-big-spenders-Italian-clubs-90s.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 21:42:52 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5545675</guid><description><![CDATA[AMITAI WINEHOUSE: If some of the transfer fees thrown around this summer made eyes water and fists shake, at least they did not incur the wrath of god, unlike Gianluigi Lentini.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

  </div>

</div></div><div class="clear"></div><p class="imageCaption">Jean-Pierre Papin (left) and Gianluca Vialli both broke the world transfer record in 1992</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Archbishop of Canterbury did not comment on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's £35m move to Liverpool. There were no missives from the chief rabbi when Chelsea paid £70m for Alvaro Morata. The Dalai Lama kept out of the debate on Alexandre Lacazette's £46.5m switch to Arsenal. But the Vatican even felt moved to comment on Lentini's transfer, calling the fee 'an offence to the dignity of work'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prices in the Italian game were spiralling. In 1992, the transfer record was broken three times, twice by AC Milan either side of Gianluca Vialli's £12m move to Juventus, with Lentini the last. Milan were the first team to break the £10m threshold when they bought Jean-Pierre Papin that summer. The Premier League may have launched that year, but the eyes of the world were on Italy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, between 1990 and 2000, the world-record transfer fee was broken 10 times. On all but three of those occasions, the buying club played in Serie A. The last one, Hernan Crespo's move to Lazio from Parma for £35.5m, was both the peak and the moment before the fall of the Italian game – the Argentinian's move is the last time a club from the country has broken the record.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It caused a reporter from the BBC to ask the question: 'Has the world gone mad?'</p><div>



</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back to Lentini and 1992, though. Deities aside, at least the move initially seemed to work on the pitch. He was a key cog in Fabio Capello's side as Milan captured the Serie A title and reached the final of the Champions League, where they surprisingly lost to Marseille.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That would be Lentini's final hurrah as a player. In 1993 he was involved in a serious car accident and while he recovered, he was never the same player again. Too much was expected of a man who was dogged by memory loss and blurred vision.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Marcel Desailly summed it up: 'You could see the skills, how he was before the accident and after the accident, the balance was completely different'. Who knows how that £13m fee, exorbitant in retrospect, would have been viewed these days if he had not made the decision to drive back from a pre-season tournament in Genoa in August 1993?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Lentini was just one symbol of a period in which the Italian game ruled both the pitch and the transfer market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was not even those headline signings that stand out to this day. Take Christian Vieri, for example.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Bolognese striker was a good striker. But between 1991, when he made his debut for Torino, and 1997, he did not score more than 12 league goals in any campaign.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That did not stop him being at the centre of the market. Every year over an eight-year period, he switched clubs. Torino to Pisa. Pisa to Ravenna. Venezia to Atalanta. Atalanta to Juventus. 'Like Brigitte Nielsen', said Juventus owner Gianni Agnelli, 'he's not on the market.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wrong. Juventus sold him to Atletico Madrid, where he finally marked himself out as an elite goalscorer, with 24 goals in 24 La Liga games. But even then he did not settle, joining the nouveau riche of Lazio for £25m. </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

That was not the only challenge for Inter at that point.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lazio may have lost Vieri in 1999 but they gained something far greater within a year – only the second scudetto in their entire history.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cragnotti's arrival as owner in 1992 had changed the face of the club. He was responsible for Paul Gascoigne's signing, which had a big part to play in the United Kingdom's fascination with the Italian top flight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sven Goran Eriksson was the manager and built a brilliant attacking football side. He also had access to incredible resources, bringing in the likes of Marcelo Salas (£16m) and Juan Sebastian Veron (£18m).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the summer of 1998 alone, he spent eight-figure fees on Vieri, Salas, Sinisa Mihajlovic, Dejan Stankovic and Ivan de la Pena. Sky blue shirts aside, the comparisons with a modern day Manchester City are obvious.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And even after they won the title, they were not sated. Crespo was snapped up from Parma in a world-record £35.5m deal.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

Over Eriksson's four years at the club, they won seven trophies. In their entire history to the point of the Swede's arrival in 1997, Lazio had captured just three pieces of silverware. 'It was very good because in Italy, if you win the league and you are not Milan, Inter or Juventus, it is a very big thing,' Eriksson recalled.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lazio really marked the end of Italy's peak spending years. There were notable moves after that point. Gianluigi Buffon's £33m transfer to Juventus from Parma in 2001 was the highest fee paid for a goalkeeper until Ederson joined Manchester City this summer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it was probably symbolic when Real Madrid smashed the world transfer record that same year to pluck Zinedine Zidane from Juventus for £46.6m. The previous Italian dominance of the market was over. The real wealth now lay elsewhere.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Still, they'll always have the 1990s.

Media across the country, across the world, went wild at this ever-growing market, Lentini being the apparent cap.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">This is not Jordan Henderson’s fault, but the moment when Gareth Southgate’s England plan may finally come to fruition is when he is no longer such an integral member of the side.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Henderson did well against Holland last week. He may even be England’s captain at the World Cup. And, if he is, he will fulfil his role with the usual diligence and selflessness. He will work hard, he will hold his position, he will use the ball to the best of his abilities; but it will not be enough.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To get out of the group, yes. England can overcome <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/tunisia/index.html" id="mol-d9f12b20-313c-11e8-a7c2-f33cd881bd81">Tunisia</a> and Panama just as they are and then the result against Belgium is largely immaterial.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img" style="height: auto;">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Jordan Henderson will use the ball to the best of his abilities; but it will not be enough</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their knock-out round opponents will come from Group H and there is little to choose between Poland, Senegal, Colombia and Japan. England may well be happy in that company, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet in the quarter-finals it is different. If all goes to form, England will probably be matched with Germany or Brazil, at which point the limitations in midfield, in particular, are going to show.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is only so far a team can travel without a gifted footballer at the heart of the team, a player who can keep possession and dictate the pace and flow of the game. England do not have that man. Henderson is not a fit and nor are his contemporaries.</p><div>



</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jack Wilshere is the nearest but is not at the level of, say, Toni Kroos and, even if he were, it is very hard for a manager to scheme his strategy around a player who could get injured crossing the tarmac to board the plane. Making Wilshere critical to England’s World Cup is a risk Southgate cannot afford to take.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So there is, in all probability, a limit to England’s ambitions right now. While Henderson is still the pivot of England’s midfield there is only going to be so far this team can go before games are taken away from them.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

  </div>

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Making Jack Wilshere critical to England’s World Cup is a risk the boss cannot afford to take</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would need a stunning plan, and extraordinary shifts at the back and from the forwards, to overcome the absence of a playmaker. Henderson is doing all he can, but even on his best days the flaws are visible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He made 91 passes against Holland, but 76 were sideways or backwards and only 15 moved the ball forward. Of those 15, just 10 were successful. Meaning Henderson’s accuracy suffers the more expansive he tries to become — and this was in a non-competitive game when he probably had more time on the ball.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric Dier, who could well be Henderson’s partner in the biggest games if Southgate plays safe against the stronger nations, is no more inventive and the attack-minded options, such as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who started the move that ended in Jesse Lingard’s goal in Amsterdam, are still not the type of individuals who dominate play.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Adam Lallana could not be relied upon to hold his position, Jake Livermore is willing but very average, and it appears Southgate was unimpressed with Danny Drinkwater’s decision to stay at Chelsea when called up to the squad towards the end of last year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of the younger options, Harry Winks has played six minutes of Premier League football for Tottenham since December 16, while Ruben Loftus-Cheek played a minute for Crystal Palace in their last match at Huddersfield, his comeback after an injury sustained in December.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He did well against Germany in November, but can hardly be saddled with being England’s Andres Iniesta in time for June, having missed the handful of opportunities to play international football since. Southgate may have to go with what he knows.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img" style="height: auto;">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Gareth Southgate may have to go with what he knows and should be cut a little slack</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">And therefore, should be cut a little slack. For the first time since the days of Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle, an England manager is trying to take the team in a new, and ambitious, direction.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sven Goran Eriksson got England organised but, like Roy Hodgson, the football was functional. Fabio Capello had England looking good in qualifying, but lost his nerve and his way at the tournament in South Africa.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Steve McClaren came with big plans to change England’s system of play, making it more flexible, but one bad night in Zagreb frightened him off.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Southgate has had his scares, too, but is determined that England will evolve. And remember, in central midfield, Venables had Paul Gascoigne, Hoddle had Paul Scholes — if Southgate could choose from options like that, his problems would be solved. Instead, he has to find other routes to goal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His forwards try to move the ball quickly, his defenders play out from the back. He used Kyle Walker and Kieran Trippier inventively against Holland, and the experiment worked, meaning more new ideas will be entertained with less scepticism. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Undoubtedly, there is progress. If England are going through a relatively barren scoring spell — three goals in five games — that is because between the defensive and forward units is a patch of rough terrain.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img" style="height: auto;">  <div class="image-wrap">

No matter the limitations of his squad, Southgate should be able to steer this team from Group G, even if they end up playing second fiddle to Belgium. Do that, however, and whatever happens next — even defeat — must be tempered by an acceptance of the ambition of his project.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Right now, this is a waiting game. Southgate is improving what he can but in other areas must make do until the player that makes the whole system fall into place comes along. He needs a playmaker.

Henderson did well against Holland last week. He may even be England’s captain at the World Cup. And, if he is, he will fulfil his role with the usual diligence and selflessness. He will work hard, he will hold his position, he will use the ball to the best of his abilities; but it will not be enough. To get out of the group, yes. England can overcome Tunisia and Panama just as they are and then the result against Belgium is largely immaterial.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Daniel Matthews</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T01:53:07.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>There is only so far England can go without a playmaker </mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T01:53:07.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>England Football,World Cup 2018</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5541995/This-Australian-team-scared-losing-decided-pursue-foul-play.html" title="Cameron Bancroft's deceit couldn't have been more obvious had he taken a Black &amp; Decker to the ball... captain Steve Smith and his leadership group should be exiled for a year"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5537897/Holland-0-1-England-Jesse-Lingard-proves-Gareth-Southgates-matchwinner.html" title="Holland 0-1 England: Jesse Lingard proves to be Gareth Southgate's matchwinner as he scores his first-ever goal for the Three Lions in friendly win"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-5533675/No-Hitler-analogies-Boris-Johnson-flew-flag-Beijing.html" title="No sign of Adolf Hitler analogies when Boris Johnson flew the flag for Beijing"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5530827/Jose-Mourinho-isnt-bully-hes-boss-high-standards.html" title="MARTIN SAMUEL: Jose Mourinho isn't a bully, he's a boss with high standards that Luke Shaw isn't meeting - what's he supposed to do, sub him in secret? - plus, more howling about Wolves and agreeing with Neil Warnock"></link></item><item><title>West Brom chief Mark Jenkins shocked by state of club's finances and admits: 'There is NO more money for wages'</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5545305/West-Brom-chief-Mark-Jenkins-shocked-state-clubs-finances.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 14:02:36 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5545305</guid><description><![CDATA[West Brom chief executive Mark Jenkins admits the club have 'no more money for wages' and is shocked at the state of the Baggies.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">On first glance, he appears to be the perfect modern coach.

There remains, however, one major reason why Tuchel would not go to Arsenal. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just a few months ago, Arsenal spent several million pounds luring Borussia Dortmund super scout Sven Mislintat to the Emirates. One of Mislintat’s biggest reasons for leaving his home club was the fallout from his clash with Tuchel. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A power battle which centred around the failed signing of Atletico Madrid’s Oliver Torres and ended with Tuchel banning Mislintat from the training ground, Tuchel’s ongoing feud with Mislintat was a key element of his fall from grace at Dortmund.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The bad blood between Tuchel and the super scout is the most convincing argument against a move to Arsenal. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unai Emery and Conte, though, are also set to leave their respective positions this summer, and Tuchel could well end up at either PSG or Chelsea.

A young football coach, known for his tactical innovation, has decided to take a gap year, and now all anybody wants to know is where he will go next. In 2013, Guardiola surprised everyone by choosing Bayern Munich. Now, Thomas Tuchel has surprised everyone by turning them down. For Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Tuchel was always the first choice to succeed caretaker coach Jupp Heynckes, and had finally persuaded president Uli Hoeness of his cause, before both men were left blushing when Tuchel reportedly turned them down this weekend.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Nathan Salt</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T15:44:31.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Tuchel is similar to Guardiola and would be ideal fit for Arsenal</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T15:44:31.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang,Premier League,Arsenal,Bundesliga,Arsene Wenger,Bayern Munich,Pep Guardiola,Borussia Dortmund</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5541551/Thomas-Tuchel-turns-Bayern-Munich-order-coach-abroad.html" title="Thomas Tuchel 'in contact' with Arsenal claims Germany legend Lothar Matthaus with ex-Borussia Dortmund boss tipped to replace Arsene Wenger after 'turning down Bayern Munich'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5520435/Thomas-Tuchel-suggests-bus-attack-hastened-Borussia-Dortmund-exit.html" title="Former Borussia Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel suggests bus bomb attack hastened his exit from the club"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5504775/Borussia-Dortmund-decline-turbulent-season.html" title="Borussia Dortmund have endured a year of managerial changes, poor form and big name departures... exit from the Europa League would be further proof of their decline"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5473079/Bayern-Munich-boss-Jupp-Heynckes-backs-Thomas-Tuchel-succeed-him.html" title="Bayern Munich boss Jupp Heynckes backs Thomas Tuchel to succeed him at Allianz Arena: 'I enjoyed watching his Borussia Dortmund side... they played great football in a good system'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/intligen/startseite/720202/artikel_bayern-absage_tuchel-wechselt-zum-fc-arsenal.html" title="Thomas Tuchel wird Trainer beim FC Arsenal - Absage an den FC Bayern - Int.

The Dutchman endured a frustrating afternoon stuck behind Fernando Alonso and despite possessing a much superior car could find no way past the fifth placed McLaren. It was not just the Red Bull driver who struggled to make an overtake, as many drivers up and down the grid struggled in Melbourne including Lewis Hamilton who was pipped to victory by Sebastian Vettel.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Dan Ripley</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T14:10:05.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Max Verstappen blasts 'boring and completely worthless' Australian GP</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T14:10:05.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-5543899/Lewis-Hamilton-beaten-Melbourne-remains-title-favourite.html" title="Lewis Hamilton may have been beaten in Melbourne but he remains my favourite for a fifth title... plus a mixed weekend for McLaren, and how to make the Australian GP more exciting"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-5542657/Grid-kids-era-starts-selection-hardly-ethnically-diverse.html" title="'Grid kids' era starts in Melbourne at Australian Grand Prix... but the selection was hardly ethnically diverse"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-5541199/Sebastian-Vettel-wins-controversial-Australian-GP-Lewis-Hamilton.html" title="Sebastian Vettel wins incident-packed Australian Grand Prix ahead of Lewis Hamilton after safety car confusion costs world champion opening 2018 race"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-5541727/Sebastian-Vettel-accepts-goading-Lewis-Hamilton-good-spirits.html" title="Sebastian Vettel accepts goading from Lewis Hamilton was in good spirits after pipping the Brit to victory at F1 curtain-raiser in Australia "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/verstappen-switched-off-worthless-melbourne-race-1019097/" title="Verstappen would've switched off &quot;worthless&quot; Australian GP"></link></item><item><title>Wales 0-1 Uruguay, China Cup final RESULT: Edinson Cavani goal denies Gareth Bale and Co in Nanning</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5544209/Wales-vs-Uruguay-China-Cup-final-LIVE-Follow-action.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 09:38:03 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5544209</guid><description><![CDATA[Edinson Cavani pulled back his trademark bow and arrow celebration and the hopes Ryan Giggs had for starting his Wales reign with silverware were shot down.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p class="mol-para-with-font">Edinson Cavani pulled back his trademark bow and arrow celebration and the hopes Ryan Giggs had for starting his Wales reign with silverware were shot down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Uruguay mastered a bad pitch better than Wales and though Giggs will have learnt more about his players a morale-boosting victory was beyond them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>READ: </strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5545193/Wales-0-1-Uruguay-Edinson-Cavani-settles-China-Cup-final.html">The full match report from the China Cup final </a></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ryan Giggs will be out to continue his fine start as Wales manager when his side take on Uruguay in the final of the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/china/index.html" id="mol-60bc9bd0-30d9-11e8-8ce8-21f7b4e361aa">China</a> Cup.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After beating the hosts 6-0 in his first game in charge Giggs will now hope to see off Uruguay in the final of the tournament after the South American outfit defeated Czech Republic 2-0 in the other semi-final.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Follow all the action from the Guangxi Sports Centre, Nanning, with kick-off at 12.35pm BST.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" class="" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5544209/Wales-vs-Uruguay-China-Cup-final-LIVE-Follow-action.html">If you are using the app, please click here to view today’s live blog </a></p><div>   <br /></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Ryan Giggs will be out to continue his fine start as Wales manager when his side take on Uruguay in the final of the China Cup.

Flowers were dropped into the stadium from an aeroplane and placed on the right wing, the crowd chanted Gigi's name and Torino won 4-0.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

The revelations are the latest in a series to emerge during an extraordinary few days as the disgraced Australia side arrived at Cape Town International airport under a police escort. Warner, captain Steve Smith, under-pressure coach Darren Lehmann and Cameron Bancroft were all pictured in the departure lounge ahead of travelling to Johannesburg for the fourth Test against South Africa on Friday. </dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>James Dutton</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T11:23:42.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>David Warner has 'gone rogue' after Australia ball-tampering shame</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T11:23:42.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5546677/David-Warner-disliked-player-worlds-disliked-team.html" title="Goodbye Reverend, hello again Bull... despite attempts to change his image, Warner is still the most disliked player in world's most disliked team"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5548315/Steve-Waugh-deeply-troubled-Australia-ball-tampering-scandal.html" title="Ex-Australia captain Steve Waugh 'deeply troubled' by ball-tampering scandal and accuses current players of 'failing our culture'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5548407/Australians-aim-hilarious-video-ball-tampering-saga.html" title="Australians take aim at their Test team with hilariously satirical rendition of 'Dreadlock Holiday' in a tongue-in-cheek dig at the ball-tampering saga"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5548381/England-coach-Trevor-Bayliss-embarrassed-Australias-ball-tampering-scandal.html" title="England coach Trevor Bayliss 'embarrassed' by Australia's ball-tampering scandal in South Africa"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5548209/Australia-call-Matt-Renshaw-fourth-Test-against-South-Africa.html" title="Australia call up Matt Renshaw for fourth Test against South Africa with Cameron Bancroft and David Warner under fire over ball-tampering scandal"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5548315/Steve-Waugh-deeply-troubled-Australia-ball-tampering-scandal.html" title="Ex-Australia captain Steve Waugh 'deeply troubled' by ball-tampering scandal and accuses current players of 'failing our culture'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/australia/aussie-cricket-cheating-scandal-david-warner-drinks-champagne-at-hotel-players-want-him-out/news-story/4d13aa1f3b1af2dc5412d38ea9479b37" title="www.foxsports.co..."></link></item><item><title>The glory days of Gazzetta Football Italia: Forget the Premier League, in the 1990s the only show in town starred Gazza, a snake, James Richardson and the primeval roar of 'Golazzo!'

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The formation of the Premier League and its poaching by Sky meant a generation were starved of live, top-level English football. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Everyone knew one kid who had Sky, but their resulting arrogance tended to mean you wouldn't want to go round their house to watch it. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Match of the Day highlights were the only access to the new Premier League, while terrestrial TV was left to show live Football League matches. Super Sunday meant Port Vale vs Grimsby.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A canny Channel 4 executive spotted the gap in the market and snapped up the TV rights to Serie A for peanuts. The shows used all the momentum of Italia 90 like a skateboarder grabbing the back of a bus and became a big hit: three million tuned in for the first live match — a 3-3 draw between Sampdoria and Lazio. We were hooked.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">The title sequence started with pumping music and shouted Italian football phrases </p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">A rumble of drums, a blaring horn, a crowd cheering. This is how it started. A football (black and white panelled, like they should always be) shoots through the air, trailing vapour, towards a giant Channel 4 emblem. The ball strikes hard and bruises it red, white and green.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A strangled synth riff kicks in, followed by a thumping house beat and wails of electric guitar — <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upFmi6KruUc">Definitive Two's 'I'm Stronger Now'</a> (the 7' version, released on Deconstruction in 1992, if you're interested). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Blurred images of whirling footballers flash past, but not before a much more important shot of a bald referee and linesman.

This was not an undisguised ode to Lazio, but a bellowed version of a terrace roar that translates, as one Italian speaker said recently, as: 'Triffic goal'. (The producers of the title sequence had it wrong too; their subtitle read: 'Gol accio.')</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Go Lazio' would, however, have made a lot of sense. It was just two years after Italia 90, the tournament that proved football was more than just tiny shorts and street fighting. It had made superstars of Paul Gascoigne and Pavarotti, and one of the two had just signed for a Serie A club. Yes, Gazza. And yes, for Lazio.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gascoigne was even signed up to be the host for Gazzetta Football Italia, the magazine show that rounded up all the latest goals, news and transfer stories from the week before the live match on Sunday's Football Italia. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 'Gazzetta' element was a play on both Gazza's name and the pink-paged Italian sports newspaper that became iconic thanks to the show: La Gazzetta dello Sport.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gazza's starring role, unsurprisingly, did not last long. As Dino Zoff, the legendary goalkeeper who was the England midfielder's coach at Lazio, put it: 'He ate ice cream for breakfast, drank beer for lunch and when injured blew up like a whale.'  </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

Although he probably could have gotten away with it on Men and Motors. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite his questionable off-field habits, Italy and England were still in love with Gazza. His first game for Lazio saw him score an injury-time equaliser in the Rome derby, the stuff of fantasy, except in Gazza's world. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His fans back in England lapped up the chance to follow his exploits in the best league in the world.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And his brief presenting career yielded some notable highlights: a tour around a zoo, featuring a terrified Gazza's close encounter with a python, and a lion nearly biting his fingers off; plus a glorious exchange that contained the phrase: 'I know that story about you and the goat.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gazza was no longer the frontman, but that accidentally opened the door to an Italian-speaking producer who stumbled into the glare of the camera.

And while ardent fans of the English top flight were watching Brian Deane, Andy Ritchie and Dean Holdsworth, Football Italia viewers had Gianfranco Zola, Gabriel Batistuta and Ronaldo.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The AC Milan team of Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard, Franco Baresi, Paolo Maldini, Zvonimir Boban et al might still claim to be the best ever seen on the Continent. They were certainly the coolest, God-like in devilish red and black stripes. Even Richardson's pronunciation of 'Meelan' added an extra layer of romance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Serie A was home to nearly every superstar of the era, snapped up by super-rich owners and clubs ready to flash huge wads of cash thanks to a bonanza in TV broadcasting rights stakes (sound familiar?).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Italy even had a whole type of player never seen in English football: a free-spirited, super-talented playmaker, given license to roam free — or stay put as was often the case — in the hope that just a few moments of their magic would decide a game. They were called 'fantasista'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Roberto Mancini, Juan Sebastian Veron, Rui Costa, Alessandro Del Piero, Francesco Totti and, of course, the divine-ponytailed demigod of No 10s, Baggio all fitted the mould.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even the supporting cast was box office: Beppe Signori and his thunderous left foot, the folically-challenged Popeye Attilio Lombardo, Sinisa Mihajlovic, a defender whose left foot conjured greater goals than most forwards, with the exception of the ludicrously talented but forever frustrating Alvaro Recoba. Other names were forever etched into impressionable minds: Daniel Fonseca, Fabrizio Ravanelli, Moreno Torricelli.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

(Buffon, Cannavaro, Thuram, Sensini, Dino Baggio, Veron, Crespo, Chiesa, Fiore. Staggering).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In addition to Gazza, there was a further sprinkling of top-class English talent to be proud of:  Paul Ince at Inter, David Platt at Bari, Juventus and Sampdoria, where  Des Walker also had an, albeit less successful, spell.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Platt was the biggest hit. 'I want to be an Italian.

But anyone listening to the battle cries of the school playground would know that we weren’t watching the Premier League. The team on everyone’s lips was not Liverpool, Manchester United, Tottenham or Chelsea, or even one from these shores. It was not even the biggest team in Rome. Back then every ball, or so it seemed, booted between jumpers for goalposts provoked the same celebration: ‘Gooooooooooo Lazio!’ It was all thanks to Channel 4’s Football Italia, and its sister show, Gazzetta Football Italia. Its title sequence – and particularly the climactic primal scream of ‘Golazzo!’- left such an impression that confused schoolchildren up and down the country could not stop shouting Lazio’s name.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Joe Strange</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T13:21:03.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>A tribute to the glory days of Gazzetta Football Italia</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T13:21:03.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Serie A</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5541517/Chelsea-manager-Conte-wanted-PSG-Mancini-Ancelotti-set-battle-Italy-boss.html" title="Chelsea manager Antonio Conte wanted by Paris Saint-Germain with Roberto Mancini and Carlo Ancelotti set to battle it out to be Italy boss "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5523373/Raiola-drops-hint-Donnarumma-leaving-Milan.html" title="Gianluigi Donnarumma could be set to leave AC Milan after agent Mino Raiola tips player's rival Pepe Reina to be No 1"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5518485/Gianluigi-Buffon-play-Italy-tribute-Davide-Astori.html" title="Gianluigi Buffon trains with Italy team as he looks to pay tribute to Davide Astori against Argentina and England"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5504707/Ferdinand-Lampard-reveal-love-Roberto-Baggio.html" title="Golazzo!

<p class="mol-para-with-font">It is often said that the captain of the Australian cricket team is the second-most important job in the country after the Prime Minister. It's why an entire nation is so outraged by Steve Smith admitting he tried to cheat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In England, you are very aware as a cricketer that you operate in the shadow of football. But when you arrive in Australia, things are different. I've always said that an Ashes tour is about more than taking on a team — it's taking on an entire country. And at the head of it all is the captain, the man who dictates the team's culture. Australians take the position very seriously.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And while they expect the captain to ensure their team play hard, they also expect them to play fair. That's why this hurts so much. All the Aussie captains of recent years have done their best to impose their stamp on the team. When Allan Border took over in the 1980s, they were a mediocre side, but he set about making them incredibly tough. </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Border was good friends with Graham Gooch from their time at Essex, but when he captained Australia in England in 1989, he walked past Gooch as if he didn't exist. He was fed up with being a good loser — and Border is now held in the highest regard.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His successor Mark Taylor is someone I have a great deal of respect for. He didn't ease up on what Border did, but turned the Australians into winners. His tactical acumen was second to none. And then came Steve Waugh.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His challenge was to take the team to the next level, which wasn't easy. So he made a big thing about the culture of the baggy green cap. He made sure his players knew about the history they were buying into, and the fact that they were just passing through. There were times when I found it all a bit much. </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">The Australian captain (right) addresses the media alongside opener Cameron Bancroft</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I felt as if Waugh was lecturing other sides about how the Australian way was the best, and how they were mentally tougher than everyone else.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I wanted to turn round and say: 'Hang on, you're in charge of possibly the best side in history. You've got Hayden, Langer, Ponting, Waugh, Gilchrist, Warne and McGrath. It has nothing to do with mental toughness!'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once, Waugh and a couple of his team-mates turned up to Wimbledon wearing their baggy greens. I have to say it all felt a bit sickly. But Waugh did the job. His side went on a record run, and raised the bar.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I never had much to do with Ricky Ponting when we were up against each other, but what I do know from working with him in commentary boxes is that he is someone I would want with me in the trenches. </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

And it's why, I think, Steve Smith's side have taken the route they have taken. Along with coach Darren Lehmann and vice-captain David Warner, Smith probably decided the Australian side were in danger of regressing to the time in the mid-1980s when they lost more often than they won. So he decided to reinstate some of the snarl, a bit like Border did so successfully.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I don't have a problem with that, but in Smith's case it's all gone too far. They've operated in such a bubble that they've lost sight of what's right and wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Previous Australian sides have come close to the line. Border was in charge when Merv Hughes abused everyone, and there were nasty moments with Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But those sides didn't get themselves into a tangle like Smith's team have. If you gave it back to them and performed well, they would show you respect. It was a two-way thing. That's been lost under Smith, whose players seem to think the opposition shouldn't fight back, and believe they are above the law. Their public expect better. As captain of Australia, Smith is on a pedestal. His mistake has been to forget that.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img" style="height: auto;">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Griezmann feels he is ready for the biggest move of his career, playing alongside Lionel Messi at one of the two stadiums he has always dreamed about calling home – the other being Old Trafford.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His arrival makes three things certain. Firstly, players will need to be sold. His arrival will open the floodgates with up to five forward or midfield players departing the club if buyers can be found.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Secondly, both Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele will have to get used to not playing every game. If they thought being the club's two most expensive ever signings would grant them that right then they were wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And thirdly, this is another signal towards the gradual morphing of Messi into a midfielder. There will be times when he takes up a position closer to Sergio Busquets than to centre forward Luis Suarez. Although that won't stop him arriving alongside Suarez with the ball at his feet seconds later.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Few transfers have been so heralded before they have actually happened as Antoine Griezmann's to Barcelona. The Catalans have done their best not to crow about the fact that they are convinced they are getting him in the summer. Atletico have done their best not to public mourn his almost inevitable departure. Until the signing is complete there is always the possibility of a U-turn from the player but it seems unlikely either side will put out and it may well be that they would face contractual financial compensation claims if they did. The No 7 shirt is waiting for him at the Camp Nou.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Robert Summerscales</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T12:45:36.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Griezmann's move to Barcelona likely to push Messi towards midfield</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T12:45:36.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Leo Messi,Luis Suarez,La liga,Transfer News,Phillipe Coutinho,Atletico Madrid,Barcelona,Antoine Griezmann</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5544117/Samuel-Umtiti-leave-Barcelona-Manchester-United.html" title="Samuel Umtiti could leave Barcelona this summer with Manchester United ready to pay £50m release clause"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5543841/Barcelona-meet-Atletico-Madrid-days-sign-Griezmann.html" title="Barcelona to meet Atletico Madrid officials 'in the next few days' as they look to complete deal for France forward Antoine Griezmann"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5542321/Paul-Pogba-Kylian-Mbappe-Antoine-Griezmann-train-France.html" title="Paul Pogba, Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann are put through their paces as France train ahead of friendly with World Cup hosts Russia"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5541401/Antoine-Griezmann-willing-pay-cut-order-join-Barcelona.html" title="Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann 'willing to take pay cut in order to join Barcelona' this summer"></link></item><item><title>Steve Smith steps down as Rajasthan Royals captain after ball-tampering scandal... so will Australia follow suit?</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5544441/Steve-Smith-steps-Rajasthan-Royals-captain.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 09:58:15 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5544441</guid><description><![CDATA[Steve Smith has been stripped of the captaincy of IPL franchise Rajasthan Royals on the eve of the new campaign for his role in Australia's ball-tampering scandal in South Africa.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

There are fears that Gomez could be ruled out for up to four weeks, which would leave him sidelined for both legs of the quarter-final against Pep Guardiola's team, as well as the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park on April 7.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Matt Maltby</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T22:33:07.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Liverpool fear Gomez could miss crunch Man City and Everton matches</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T22:33:07.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Liverpool</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5545329/Liverpool-train-wait-international-stars-Mohamed-Salah-Roberto-Firmino-return.html" title="Liverpool train as they wait for international stars Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino to return"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5544637/Liverpool-defender-Joe-Gomez-reveals-benefiting-hugely-working-Virgil-Van-Dijk.html" title="Liverpool defender Joe Gomez reveals he is benefiting hugely from working with January signing Virgil Van Dijk: 'It's a great opportunity to learn'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5542609/Heres-Gareth-Southgate-thinking-23-man-England-squad.html" title="Gareth Southgate is set to pick his 23-man squad for Russia... here's who the England manager is thinking will make his selection for the 2018 World Cup"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5542145/Gareth-Southgate-chats-Harry-Kane-England-train-Tottenham.html" title="Gareth Southgate chats to Harry Kane as England use Tottenham's facilities to train ahead of Italy clash while defender Joe Gomez is forced to leave the squad due to ankle injury"></link></item><item><title>Nick Kyrgios sparks war of words with Fernando Verdasco after world No 20 tweets about wanting the Spanish player to lose against fellow Aussie Thanasi Kokkinakis at Miami Open: 'Verdasco is the saltiest dude'</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-5547035/Nick-Kyrgios-sparks-war-words-Fernando-Verdasco.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 22:04:02 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5547035</guid><description><![CDATA[Nick Kyrgios sparked a war of words with Fernando Verdasco on Monday night after the world No 20 tweeted the Spanish player and called him 'the saltiest dude'.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

On Monday night the agency insisted that the attack, possibly by the same Russian hackers who accessed the data of other doping agencies in the past two years, had failed. Staff were called to a UKAD meeting in London on Monday but sent home after the agency was forced to shut down its servers.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I thought of that while reading a mammoth new biography on Tiger, entitled Tiger Woods, that reaches the bookshelves on Tuesday and which the publisher, Simon and Schuster, hopes will be seen as the definitive work.

Despite defeat last time around, the Italians looked in good spirits as they took a look around the pitch at the home of English football.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Patrick Boyland</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T20:25:29.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Italy check in at Wembley ahead of Tuesday's friendly against England</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T20:25:29.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>England</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5544185/Italy-new-generation-Azzurris-young-hopes.html" title="Italy and the new generation: After their World Cup qualifying failure, who are the young guns aiming to fire the Azzurri back to the big time? "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5546305/The-incredible-story-Gigi-Meroni-Italys-answer-George-Best-just-24-killed.html" title="The incredible story of Gigi Meroni: Italy's answer to George Best who at just 24 was killed after being hit by a car driven by adoring teenage Torino fan – who then became club president!"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5544359/Gianluigi-Buffon-poses-selfie-fan-Italy-stars-leave-hotel-training.html" title="Gianluigi Buffon poses for selfie with supporter as Italian stars leave hotel for morning training ahead of facing England at Wembley"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5544809/England-players-use-rockets-bands-medicine-balls-training.html" title="England players use Nerf rockets, medicine balls and resistance bands in action packed training session ahead of Tuesday friendly with Italy"></link></item><item><title>Jack Butland handed starting role for England against Italy as goalkeepers battle for No 1 spot at World Cup 2018</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5545065/Jack-Butland-handed-starting-role-England-against-Italy.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 13:10:36 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5545065</guid><description><![CDATA[Jack Butland will be given the chance to audition for England's No 1 jersey at this summer's World Cup after being given the nod to start in Tuesday's friendly with Italy.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

If you see a two-yard pass, pass it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘When I used to dribble, I’d be on the wing and I’d control it with the outside of my foot. It slows the ball down. He brings you back to what you used to do with the under eights, open your body up, get the rhythm going again. It’s little details like that. When you’re playing a game you probably don’t pick up on it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Little touches outside your foot, trapped under your foot, he’s telling you to get to the left back quicker, open your body out and take it with you instead of just controlling it and stopping. Little details, even though you’re thinking I already know this.’</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group mol-hidden-caption">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption"> </p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sterling described the Catalan as ‘a good person’. ‘Especially for young players,’ he said. ‘I feel before I was more raw; when I got the ball I wanted to take someone on, beat someone. Now I am trying to pick my moments, if it is on, if it is not, and try to get in the box as much as I can. That’s mainly where I am now.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Southgate was already listening intently but his interest in the exchange escalated when Sterling referenced him. Asked why it has been three years since he last scored for England, Sterling jokingly blamed the man to his left.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It is because the gaffer takes me off early,’ he said with a smile. ‘No, it is a different environment, a different set-up. I should be scoring a lot more for England. I put a lot of pressure on myself. I’ve done that at my club. I wasn’t scoring a lot of goals there either, but that’s changed.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He did, however, stress that ‘even at Liverpool’ many of his goals ‘came late in games’. And the fact is no other player in the Premier League has scored more goals in the last 10 minutes of a game this season. So maybe Southgate should leave Sterling on when he has hooked him in five of the seven games he has started.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"><div class="splitLeft"><div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

He started the press conference by insisting that England had not yet benefited from his own rise in standards, stating that on the international stage there was still plenty of room for improvement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That might well be true, however composed he looked against Holland last Friday, but it remains a significant step up from where he was two years ago. ‘I had a rough year, my first at City, a big club for a big transfer fee,’ he said. ‘There was a lot of talk, a lot of pressure. I didn’t think I was being spoken about in a fair manner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘As a young boy, I was 20-21, I didn’t think I was being treated right. It can affect anyone. So it was about how I bounced back, how I had to try and move on. Not let that defeat me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It was disappointing when you put on the shirt and get negative feedback. But at the same time the fans want to see you perform well. They’re not doing it in a malicious way, it’s to make you know you need to step up.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ahead of England’s last game before he picks his squad for this summer’s World Cup, Southgate could not have seemed happier. Here, after all, was an important member of his side in good form off as well as on the pitch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And he encouraged Sterling to take some credit, however influential Guardiola might have been. ‘If a player isn’t willing to learn, and have the mindset and determination to improve, then all of those messages are wasted,’ he said.</p><div>

Alvin Martin credits former England coach Don Howe with transforming his career when he told him to defend on the half-turn.

And, judging by the season he has so far enjoyed, Guardiola has had a similar impact on Sterling.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Daniel Matthews</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T22:42:10.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Pep quick fix has got me firing again, claims Raheem Sterling</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T22:42:10.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>England</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5533671/England-adopt-Man-Citys-4-3-3-instead-three-back.html" title="Gareth Southgate may be set on playing a back three but England should adopt Manchester City’s 4-3-3 ...

Whatever happened to playing for the interval?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It may be harsh to single out Ben Stokes when he batted so well for his slowest half-century in Tests, but his 66 off 188 balls was ended by a brainless piece of cricket all too common in England's Test batting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Neil Wagner had been undertaking one of his trademark long spells full of short-pitched, aggressive bowling when he rattled Stokes and tempted him into a terrible shot that saw him hole out to point three balls before the dinner break.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At that stage, with England at 300 for six, Stokes and Chris Woakes had batted throughout the middle session and England really did look like replicating their nail-biting draw here in 2013 when they ended up nine wickets down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alas, it was not to be and once Stokes had gone the end was nigh for England, the wholehearted Wagner ending with three victims in an excellent New Zealand display.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Worryingly, Stokes had to take painkilling tablets for soreness in his back towards the end of his innings and there will be another 'will he play, won't he play' debate ahead of the second Test in his home city. </p><div class="mol-img-group xwArtSplitter"><div class="mol-img" style="height: auto;">  <div class="image-wrap">

When England were bowled out for 51 in Jamaica in 2009 they dropped Ian Bell. That proved a catalyst for their improvement under new captain Andrew Strauss.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, as Root continues making his way as a leader, there is a case to replace Moeen with a wild card in Lancashire's Liam Livingstone or a specialist spinner in Somerset's Jack Leach to shake things up. It has reached the point where there is very little to lose.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Similarly, Woakes might have made a battling half-century and almost taken England to safety but, while it would be unthinkable to drop him at home, his record in his principal role as a bowler overseas is getting worse.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Woakes went wicketless here and is now claiming his victims away from home at more than 60 apiece. Surely it is time to give the extra pace of Mark Wood a go.

Their Test travel sickness is becoming acute. England's failure to bat out the last day of the first Test here leaves them with no margin for error in the last match of their longest modern winter tour. They have to win in Christchurch to arrest their worst away run since the war. The statistics are damning. England are without a win in 12 away Tests and have lost 10 of them, five innings defeats coming in their last eight games.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Robert Summerscales</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T21:00:31.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>New Zealand thrash England by an innings and 49 runs at Eden Park</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T21:00:31.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>England Cricket</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5542575/Australia-hated-team-world-cricket-disbanded.html" title="Australia are the most hated team in world cricket...

However, he will have a more realistic chance of being fit to play against Swansea City on April 7.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Jonathan Spencer</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T17:48:56.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Daniel Sturridge back training with West Brom physios</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T17:48:56.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Premier League,Liverpool,West Bromwich Albion</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5545305/West-Brom-chief-Mark-Jenkins-shocked-state-clubs-finances.html" title="West Brom chief Mark Jenkins shocked by state of club's finances and admits: 'There is NO more money for wages'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5544721/Liverpool-goalkeeper-Simon-Mignolet-vows-stay-fight-No-1-spot.html" title="Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet vows to stay and fight for place despite losing No 1 spot to Loris Karius: 'It's never easy but all I can do is try change that and prove I'm ready'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5539541/Vardy-10-fastest-players-PL-history-top.html" title="Jamie Vardy and Carl Jenkinson are among the top 10 fastest players in Premier League history... but which flyer tops the rankings?"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5545263/Man-United-target-Stefan-Vrij-snubs-elite-clubs-Inter-Milan.html" title="Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal target Stefan De Vrij 'ready to snub elite clubs and join Inter Milan'"></link></item><item><title>Samuel Umtiti could embarrass Manchester United like Sergio Ramos did in transfer chase... but if Barcelona do not hand 'Big Sam' a big pay rise he WILL head to Old Trafford for £53m</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5548763/Umtiti-embarrass-Manchester-United-like-Ramos-did-transfer-chase.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 09:50:50 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5548763</guid><description><![CDATA[PETE JENSON: The news that Samuel Umtiti is stalling on a new contract and is available at £53m will have had some Manchester United supporters dreaming of an Umtiti-Bailly partnership.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Manchester United are ready to pounce if the France defender does not agree a new deal</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Barcelona players and supporters will be up in arms if he leaves this summer, and the player knows it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That's why he is playing a patient waiting game to get the best new deal possible before next season begins.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Few signings have worked out as well for Barcelona over the last five years than their acquisition of Umtiti for just £22m from Lyon in 2016.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the first three months of last season he looked as good as any central defender in Europe, and at a third of the price of the 'going rate' for a good centre back it was the best money Barcelona had spent in a long time.</p><div>



</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">He's loved by a dressing room that has dubbed him 'Big Sam' and hailed by supporters who waited a long time for the club to replace Javier Mascherano. Gerard Pique has not been this comfortable alongside a central defensive partner since the days of Carles Puyol. Left-footed, quick and powerful, Umititi can play to Pique's left in the middle and cover the forward runs of Jordi Alba.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His form has dipped ever so slightly since coming back from a torn thigh muscle in December but he would still be in the running if there were such a thing at the Nou Camp as fans' player of the year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In short, the board needs to renew his deal so that his buy-out clause can be bumped up to something that will keep the likes of Jose Mourinho away. Umtiti has a deal until 2021 and he also wants a new contract  that will put him on around £8m net per season. Barcelona's wage bill is constantly at bursting point and they have so far balked at those demands.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For now, Barca's general manager, Pep Segura, is not expecting the worst. The player is managed by his brother, Yannick, and there is no indication that he wants to move Samuel out at any cost. The player is happy at Barcelona and looking forward to sharing a dressing room with close pal and France team-mate Antoine Griezmann next season.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But he wants to be respected in the club's salary scale and he has sufficient confidence in his own ability to have an impressive World Cup, boosting his market value even higher, and so even further beyond that low buy-out clause.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So is this Ramos mark II for United? Ramos would have gone to United three years ago had Real Madrid not caved in to his demands. Likewise Umtiti will be wearing red next season if Barcelona don't give him the pay rise he wants.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img" style="height: auto;">  <div class="image-wrap">

If he is moved up to £8m then his salary will have more than doubled according to estimates of his current earnings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The market for central defenders has changed drastically in the last two years and the price that Liverpool paid Southampton for Virgil van Dijk and Manchester City paid Athletic Bilbao for Aymeric Laporte mean various big clubs will not blink before laying down £53m for Umtiti.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Barcelona are confident that he will be going nowhere but options such as Sevilla's Clement Lenglet, who has a £26m buyout clause, have been mentioned just in case the seemingly inevitable renewal never comes to pass.</p><div>

South Africa took a 2-1 lead in the four-Test series in Cape Town on Sunday, thrashing the Aussies by 322 runs in a match that was overshadowed by events on the third day. Steve Smith was given a one-match ban and stood down from the Australian captaincy after admitting to deliberately trying to alter the condition of the ball.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>James Dutton</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T17:18:22.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>MCC criticise player conduct in South Africa-Australia series</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T17:18:22.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5544441/Steve-Smith-steps-Rajasthan-Royals-captain.html" title="Steve Smith steps down as Rajasthan Royals captain after ball-tampering scandal... so will Australia follow suit?"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5544221/BUMBLE-TEST-Australia-golden-chance-set-new-values.html" title="BUMBLE AT THE TEST: Australia have a golden chance to come up with a new set of values after this ball-tampering scandal... how many will be thought of as champions when they retire?"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5544667/Joe-Root-not-aware-ball-tampering-Ashes.html" title="Joe Root 'not aware of any ball tampering' during the Ashes but admits Australia scandal is 'disappointing for Test cricket' "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5544129/Cricket-Australia-chief-jets-South-Africa-investigate-ball-tampering-scandal.html" title="Cricket Australia chief jets out to South Africa to investigate ball-tampering scandal as former coach John Buchanan questions current boss Darren Lehmann's role in saga"></link></item><item><title>Joe Root admits England will undergo 'soul searching' after crushing defeat by New Zealand extends winless away run to 12 Tests... the worst in 80 years</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5544747/England-undergo-soul-searching-crushing-New-Zealand-defeat.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 11:26:45 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5544747</guid><description><![CDATA[PAUL NEWMAN IN AUCKLAND: Joe Root admitted England would undergo some 'soul searching' after another crushing defeat in the first Test to New Zealand.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Making four appearances and scoring one goal, King has been part of a revitalisation under Carlos Carvahal, which has seen the club move up to 14th in the table.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Alex Martin</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T16:10:08.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Swansea 'ready to sign Andy King from Leicester'</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T16:10:08.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Swansea City,Transfer News,Leicester City</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5532377/Paul-Clement-appointed-new-Reading-manager-24-hours.html" title="Paul Clement could be appointed new Reading manager in the next 24 hours"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5541935/Didier-Drogba-Jose-Mourinho-harsh-Paul-Pogba-likes-him.html" title="Didier Drogba says Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho is only harsh on Paul Pogba because he likes him as former Chelsea striker admits: 'It was heated between us more than once'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5541603/Jose-Mourinho-best-fighting-claims-Carlos-Carvalhal.html" title="Manchester United's Jose Mourinho is at best when 'fighting', claims Carlos Carvalhal: 'He's a different personality to me... he likes confrontation'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5539541/Vardy-10-fastest-players-PL-history-top.html" title="Jamie Vardy and Carl Jenkinson are among the top 10 fastest players in Premier League history... but which flyer tops the rankings?"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/swansea-want-sign-loanee-andy-12251360" title="Swansea want to sign loanee Andy King from Leicester permanently - but only if they avoid relegation - Mirror Online"></link></item><item><title>UEFA confirm Champions League and Europa League teams can name 12 players on the bench in the final and use a fourth substitute in extra time</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5548783/Champions-League-Europa-League-teams-12-substitutes-final.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 09:57:53 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5548783</guid><description><![CDATA[The new rules, which will come into action next season, also state that teams can use a fourth substitute in extra time during the knockout stages.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

After that his schedule is likely to take in at least one of the outdoor hard-court bottom-tier Futures tournaments due to take place in Tunisia in May as he starts out on the long road back from testing positive at last year’s Barcelona Open.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Will Griffee</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T00:41:46.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Dan Evans set for comeback from cocaine ban in April</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T00:41:46.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/esports/article-5545943/Gamers-play-French-Open-tennis-makes-esports-debut.html" title="Gamers will play at the French Open as tennis makes its esports debut with a tournament hosted by Roland Garros"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-5542183/Jo-Konta-beats-Elise-Mertens-straight-sets-Miami-Open.html" title="Jo Konta impressively beats Elise Mertens in straight sets at Miami Open as she looks to be returning to form"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-5540417/Maria-Sharapova-mountain-climb-battle-world-tennis.html" title="Maria Sharapova's injuries and split from her coach mean ex-champion has a mountain to climb if she is ever to battle back to the top of world tennis"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-5539895/Caroline-Wozniacki-says-Miami-Open-fans-wished-death-her.html" title="Caroline Wozniacki says Miami Open fans 'wished death' on her family and told fiance's young niece and nephew to 'shut the f*** up' during defeat"></link></item><item><title>Ipswich to decide future of manager Mick McCarthy before the end of the season, says owner Marcus Evans </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5544737/Ipswich-decide-future-Mick-McCarthy-end-season.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 11:14:41 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5544737</guid><description><![CDATA[Reports have suggested the 59-year-old's six-year spell in charge at Portman Road could end this summer.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">For five-and-a-half rounds he was pummelled and pounded into a bloody mess and if this felt like the true beginning of Whyte's life at the top table, it could well spell the end for a man who once held the WBA 'regular' world title, for a few days at least.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The disparity in skills was obvious from the first bell, as Whyte regularly punished Browne, the challenger who made ever more crude attempts to set up his hammer right hand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By the second round, the hometown fighter had opened up a nasty cut above his opponent's left eye. By round three a number of big right hands had rendered the Australian's face crimson.

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Scotland trained ahead of their friendly, having lost to Costa Rica in McLeish's first game back</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">MTK Hungaria's stadium in Budapest - now demolished - was the scene for the fateful game against Nazi Germany and Pele's iconic overhead kick.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Big Jock had said to us: "If anyone wants to stay on and be extras...",' McLeish recalled ruefully. 'I always regret that film never had a ginger-headed Scotsman in it...' One regret from Hungary is more than most men will ever acquire.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And Big Eck has no desire to add a second by becoming the first Scotland boss since Berti Vogts to lose his opening two games in charge of the national team.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The criticism which followed Friday's uninspiring, experimental defeat to Costa Rica has been prolonged and sometimes fierce.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Failure to beat a Hungary team 50th in the FIFA rankings after a 3-2 home defeat to Kazakhstan on Friday would be unlikely to improve the negativity and indifference surrounding Scotland's national team.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I have to get a result,' McLeish admitted. 'We have to change the culture and get a winning mentality. The evidence has to be there for the players but it will only be there if they win.</p><div>



</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It can start with one big performance and result. We've got to believe that. This game takes on more importance after the defeat to Costa Rica. I guess if we don't get the right result then I'm a bigger dud than I was on Friday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm going to have to have rhinoceros skin but I'm pleased with the players and the way they've adjusted. The second half was better on Friday and they were happy with what we showed them on Sunday. Now it's about taking it to the next stage.' By his own admission, McLeish found himself in no-win territory against Costa Rica.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sticking with a Gordon Strachan team offered no guarantees of victory and would have brought criticism from those who think the national team desperately needs new blood. Yet, by fielding five new caps, McLeish always risked a performance lacking fluency.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I've not read all the critiques,' he insisted. 'I've only seen one or two things. But I tend not to get my knickers in a twist over something like that. I'm on a kind of pathway here where I feel I am doing the right thing and at the end of it I believe it was the right thing to do. I am sticking to that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's not good to lose your first home game, especially at Hampden.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We made enough chances in the second half to at least get something from it.' The concern is obvious. Scotland's next three friendlies are away from home in Budapest, Peru and Mexico before a Nations League warm-up against Belgium in September. None can be considered a gimme.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

Changes will be necessary after Scott McTominay, Grant Hanley and Matt Ritchie returned to their clubs injured.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Celtic's Jack Hendry is likely to start in defence. The midfield three is also likely to feature Stuart Armstrong, Callum McGregor and John McGinn of Hibs.

The withdrawal of Hanley - and Russell Martin from the original squad - leaves central defence and right-back desperately short.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

He is a young centre half who is a great prospect.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Attacking options are also thin on the ground. McLeish believes Oli McBurnie had a 'smashing' debut, yet the lack of strikers in the squad shows how little he has to work with. Stick with Strachan's old guard and he's damned if he does. Fail to try out new players and he's damned if he doesn't.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If I continue with things and we get a reverse it's even worse,' he said.

You have to take a step back to go two forward.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Under Gordon they had a defeat-free season and it would have been nice to continue the unbeaten run.

</div>    </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Italy's next full-time coach will be announced on May 20. The favourites are Carlo Ancelotti, Antonio Conte and Roberto Mancini. Claudio Ranieri is a dark horse. But few reporters are giving Di Biagio a chance of keeping the job, even if he masterminds a win at Wembley.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The task facing Di Biagio was always daunting. As soon as Italy failed to qualify for the World Cup, dramatic cries of 'revolution' filled the gloomy air. Everyone from fans to press demanded a fresh start and the changing of the guard.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Di Biagio, and anyone within the game, knew that you can't axe a squad overnight. Some retired, like Daniele de Rossi, others, like Gianluigi Buffon will probably bow out after these friendlies. But Leonardo Bonucci, Ciro Immobile, Jorginho, Alessandro Florenzi, Andrea Belotti, Marco Verratti and Lorenzo Insigne still have a future in blue.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In these two games Di Biagio is trying to usher in young talent like Fiorentina winger Federico Chiesa and AC Milan striker Patrick Cutrone, but also select enough of the established side to avoid embarrassing defeats. </p><div>



</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some goals would help too. After the blank against Argentina, Italy haven't scored in three games. They have only found the net three times in the last 630 minutes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Di Biagio is a strong character, and overcame adversity in his playing career. Most notably in the Italy shirt. A tenacious and courageous central midfielder, Di Biagio missed a penalty in the shootout against France in the quarter-final of the 1998 World Cup.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Walking up to the ball he was confident in his ability to score, having converted a dozen in training the day before. But his shot cannoned off Fabien Barthez's bar, and Italy were out. The Azzurri gave France the hardest match of that tournament, but it was in vain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Di Biagio had his redemption though. In another match against the hosts, this time the Euro 2000 semi-final against Netherlands, spot-kicks were required to find a winner. </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style"><div class="splitLeft"><div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Italy were beaten 2-0 by Argentina despite Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero being in the stands</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I wasn't supposed to take a penalty, but [Alessandro] Del Piero and [Filippo] Inzaghi had gone off during the game. The boss, Dino Zoff, asked me to take a penalty, and despite my fear and uncertainty, I didn't think about saying "no" for a second. This time it went well.' Di Biagio told the Italy team's YouTube channel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A reliable player with hometown club Roma, Inter and then Brescia, Di Biagio began his coaching career in 2008. Three years later he entered the national team system, taking over the Under 20s. Making impressive progress, Di Biagio became Under 21 coach in 2013.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 46-year-old guided Italy's youngsters in two European Championships. In the first of those tournaments his side faced England, led by Gareth Southgate. The match finished 3-1 to Italy. Last year the Azzurri reached the competition's semi-finals, losing to a brilliant Spain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then came the senior side's Armageddon against Sweden, and the resignation of coach Giampiero Ventura. An interim boss was needed, and Di Biagio seemed the obvious solution. Although not for everyone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Claudio Gentile, ferocious right back of Italy's 1982 World Cup winning team, and a former U21 coach himself, told Radio Sportiva: 'It looks to me that there aren't any good options. Di Biagio failed with the Under 21s, a side with six players from the senior team, after he'd said it was the best Under 21 group for 20 years. I don't think he's earned this opportunity.'</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Di Biagio falls on his back after missing a penalty in the quarter-final shootout against France at the 1998 World Cup</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Others have been more encouraging. Gazzetta dello Sport's Sebastiano Vernazza wrote 'if this is 'year zero' for Italy, it's right to press 'reset', like coach Fulvio Bernardini did after the disaster at World Cup 1974, and Azeglio Vicini did after Mexico '86. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The fewer players from the play-off against Sweden there are at Wembley, the more Italy can bring in the future. Be bold, Di Biagio.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In what could be his final game in charge, Di Biagio could move from a 4-3-3 to a 4-2-3-1, with Atalanta's revelation Bryan Cristante in the No 10 role. Cristante, 23, was once considered the next big thing at Milan, making his debut in the Champions League aged 16. But his habit of taking too many touches slowed him down and he slipped out of contention, joining Benfica.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But now he has been revived by wily Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini, and scored 11 goals this season. Midfield will be a pressing issue for the next Italy coach. Jorginho of Napoli has tremendous quality, but is yet to shine for the Azzurri.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there is the eternal promise of Marco Verratti. On the scene since 2014, the PSG player is confident and has got the ability to be the fulcrum of the national side. But a combination of injuries and indiscipline have stunted his development.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At 25, Verratti has time on his side, but the sooner the national team can find the best way to use him, the better. His persistence, agility and energy are formidable and he is blatantly capable of more than he has shown in his 25 appearances so far.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Far from a meaningless friendly, Tuesday night's game is an opportunity for several players to stake their claim. And if it is Luigi Di Biagio's last match, he'll want to go out with a bang, at the very least a goal.</p><div>

Australia was plunged into turmoil after captain Steve Smith admitted on Saturday that senior players had conspired with opening batsman Cameron Bancroft to tamper with the ball during the third test against South Africa in Cape Town. Sutherland, who already asked Smith and David Warner to step down as captain and vice-captain respectively, is expected to come down hard on the team's senior figures after being given a report into the scandal.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>James Dutton</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T07:00:48.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Australia chief arrives in South Africa over ball-tampering scandal</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T07:00:48.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5545867/Steve-Smith-set-stripped-Australian-captaincy.html" title="Australia set to kick out shamed captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner... with coach Darren Lehmann also expected to step down after ball-tampering scandal"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5546545/NASSER-HUSSAIN-Baggy-green-tainted-Steve-Smiths-snarl.html" title="Australia's baggy green is tainted by captain Steve Smith's snarl"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5546677/David-Warner-disliked-player-worlds-disliked-team.html" title="Australia vice-captain David Warner is the most disliked player in the world's most disliked team"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5545063/Ex-South-Africa-captain-Fanie-Villiers-reveals-told-cameramen-look-ball-tampering.html" title="Ex-South Africa captain Fanie de Villiers reveals he instructed cameramen to look out for signs of ball tampering... and it took an hour and a half: 'We said go out and have a look, boys.
