In it, she described the alleged affair that took place between her and Donald Trump in July 2006, claiming to have had a sexual encounter with the president.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the interview, Daniels stated that Trump said she was ‘special’ and also offered her a role on his hit TV show Celebrity Apprentice. She also stated that she ‘was never a victim’ and that her coming forward was not part of the broader #MeToo movement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In perhaps the biggest bombshell from the interview, Daniels claimed that she was threatened in 2011 by an unknown man who told her to ‘leave Trump alone’ after she agreed to sell her story to the magazine In Touch Weekly. The man also appeared to subtly threaten Daniels after motioning to her infant daughter and stating that 'it would be a shame if something happened to her mom'. The incident left her ‘rattled’ but she declined to go to the police because she was too frightened about the ordeal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the explosive interview, Daniels also said that Trump told her not to worry about his wife Melania since they slept in separate rooms and that she viewed her relationship with Trump as primarily a business deal. She also said that she declined a number of ‘large paydays’ because she never wanted to ‘kiss and tell’ about the alleged affair.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to reports, Daniels’s relationship with Donald Trump goes back to July 2006 when they met at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. Daniels claims that she and Trump had unprotected sex and he later promised her an appearance on Celebrity Apprentice. Daniels also claimed that Trump invited her to his office at Trump Tower in New York City and a Trump Vodka launch party event in <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/california/index.html">California</a>. She also stated that she and Trump met in 2007 about a year after their reported affair in his private bungalow in Los Angeles, to discuss the details of a possible role for her on Celebrity Apprentice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Later, after agreeing to sell her story of the reported affair to In Touch Weekly in 2011, Daniels claimed to have been threatened by a mysterious man who was reportedly somehow linked to Trump. She subsequently denied a report on a celebrity gossip website of the alleged affair with Trump that surfaced mere months later.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the eve of the 2016 election, Daniels was reportedly paid $130,000 (£91,477) backed by a nondisclosure agreement by Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen to stay quiet about their alleged encounter, with Daniels agreeing to sign off on the arrangement out of fear for her personal safety and the safety of her family.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

The directing legend said that films released by the video-streaming service are essentially just 'TV movies', adding that studios would rather make tent-pole movies than take a chance on smaller productions, thus potentially threatening the future of theatrical movie-making.

If it’s a good show, you deserve an Emmy.
