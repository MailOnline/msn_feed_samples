</div><div class="clear"></div><p class="imageCaption">Around a third of pre-menopausal women and half of older women are reporting sexual problems (FILE photo)</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s now 20 years since Viagra provided an instant fix for men who struggled to achieve an erection, however scientists have not been able to produce as successful a pill to help women feel more in the mood.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some experts think the reason this has proved so elusive is that many women are dealing with underlying health conditions, from incontinence to menopausal symptoms and pelvic pain, that affect their interest in sex, and no ‘pink Viagra’ is going to sort this out. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet for years a female Viagra has been the Holy Grail. So there has been some excitement about a drug called bremelanotide, which has just undergone successful phase 3 clinical trials in the U.S., the last stage before a drug can be licensed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was originally tested as a tanning pill in the Eighties but was found to boost muscle recovery. Body builders of both sexes found unexpected benefits — the men reported spontaneous erections, the women said it put them ‘in the mood’. The drug company, Palatin Technologies, switched their efforts to developing it as a treatment for female sexual dysfunction.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The drug works by binding to chemicals in the brain involved in sexual desire, increasing production of the ‘feel-good’ chemical dopamine which plays a key function in arousal. For best effects, the woman must inject herself around 45 minutes before sex.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trials found it worked better than a placebo but the development of the treatment suffered a setback in 2007 when the original nasal spray version was found to cause high blood pressure in some, leading the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S. to halt trials.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The manner of administering the drug was changed to an injection. The latest trials have shown that as well as improving a woman’s libido generally, bremalanotide also makes sex more satisfying for premenopausal women. Palatin Technologies now hopes to make billions from worldwide sales.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But before the champagne is opened, experts urge caution. Not least because bremelanotide would not be the first ‘female Viagra’ to be licensed and promise much —only to then fall short. Addyi was also labelled the female Viagra when it was launched in 2015.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Originally developed as an antidepressant, it reduces the effect of the brain chemical serotonin, which in turn leads to an increase in dopamine levels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the UK, Addyi is yet to receive approval due to the cost (up to £700 for a month’s supply) as well as concerns about its effectiveness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even in the U.S., where it is licensed, take–up has been slow, probably because Addyi doesn’t help all women — only around 10 per cent found any increase in ‘sexually satisyfing events’ compared to those taking a placebo, and around 75 per cent of those who take it experience side-effects such as nausea, headache and dizziness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It also has to be taken daily, and drinking alcohol can make side-effects worse.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But if a pill isn’t the answer, researchers at the University of Michigan in the U.S. have been trying out a new device which sends electrical signals from a needle inserted in a woman’s ankle to stimulate nerves and blood supply in the genital area.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although it reportedly creates a pleasant tingling, there are concerns about how practical it is during energetic love-making sessions (as the needle needs to remain in situ). </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Study  published in the journal BMJ Open found that more than a third of 5,000 women aged between 16-74 had lost interest in sex</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The focus on pills — and zappers — misses the bigger problem, say experts. This is not just that there are so many complex factors in female desire, such as stress and breakdown of relationships — though clearly these play a role.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘A woman seeks intimacy which leads her to be receptive to sexual stimuli and only then feels desire,’ says Dr Catherine Hood, a consultant in psychosexual medicine at St Pancras Hospital, London.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However experts are increasingly admitting that often low libido in women is nothing to do with what’s going on in their head — there are a whole range of physical issues that can kill desire.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It might be that the muscles in their pelvis are so tense it makes it difficult to have sex, or the impact of the menopause makes it painful. Fix the physical problem, they say, and a woman’s normal desire for sex will return.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There are many physical reasons why women lose their desire for sex, including illness and pelvic pain,’ says Dr Hood.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It may be that drugs could help solve issues that are caused by genuine chemical or hormonal imbalances, but these are just one small part of a bigger picture when it comes to low libido in women.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet these physical factors are often overlooked, says Myra Robson, senior women’s health therapist at the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We see women who are trying to maintain good sex lives while dealing with issues such as endometriosis, [where womb lining-like tissue develops elsewhere, causing scarring and irritation] which can cause deep pelvic pain; fibroids, which affect the lining of the womb, and stress incontinence, which affects one in three women after childbirth,’ she says. ‘These things need to be sorted out first before we go for the candles and the chocolates, and long before we even think about female Viagra.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dyspareunia, or painful sex, is a common cause of low sex drive in women. Around 30 per cent of women experience this according to an article in the Journal of Sexual Medicine in 2015. Large numbers of women do not tell their partner when sex hurts. They might want to have sex, but go off it as it is so painful for them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It’s a common and distressing complaint and it has been a neglected female health problem and can affect young women, women after having children and women who are already through the menopause,’ says Mike Bowen, a consultant gynaecologist based in London and Oxford. ‘It can be felt as deep pain within the pelvis or superficial pain in the vulva during intercourse.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is associated with issues such as vaginal dryness and anxiety about sex as well as a range of physical problems, from painful skin conditions to urinary tract infections and endometriosis. Women who have perineal scars after childbirth are also more likely to find sex painful until the scar tissue has stretched and softened, which can take years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Fortunately, there are many ways to treat dyspareunia, by treating the underlying causes, whether they be physical, emotional or a combination of both,’ says Mr Bowen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any form of incontinence can put women off sex: Stress incontinence, the most common form that leads to small leaks of urine when someone coughs, sneezes or laughs, affects around one in three women in the UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Women may feel dirty and unclean and they may not want to have sex at all,’ says Dr Hood.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

  </div>

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">According to the Sexual Advice Association, the main cause is a lack of desire</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stress incontinence occurs because weakness around the pelvic floor (the band of muscles that stretch from the pubic bone to the front to the spine) means the neck of the bladder is not well-supported, so urine can leak out when the bladder is put under pressure. This commonly happens after childbirth, as the ligaments that support the pelvic floor become stretched during pregnancy or labour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pelvic floor exercises can help — although ideally these should be done under the guidance of a specialist physiotherapist, who are in short supply.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Apps such as Squeezy and gadgets such as Innovo, which emits electrical impulses to contract the pelvic floor muscles, can help.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There is a place for these devices but women can also try simple techniques like going to the loo before sex and abstaining from coffee and tea, which are mild diuretics,’ says Dr Hood.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A lesser-known issue is pelvic tension, when muscles in the pelvic floor are knotted and tight, which can make sex virtually impossible. Yet it is surprisingly common: up to 15 per cent of women aged between 18 and 50 are affected, according to a study published in the March 1996 issue of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It can be caused by stress and anxiety, slouched posture, chronic constipation and even over-exercise. It is a recognised medical condition which can be treated by internal massage, widely available on the NHS.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Amanda Savage, a specialist pelvic floor physiotherapist at the private South Cambridge Physiotherapy clinic in Hauxton, Cambridge, treats many women who suffer from pelvic tension.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We often find that women have such overly tense muscles in their pelvic region, their muscles are unable to let go and relax. This can cause long-term pain.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s generally assumed that desire will naturally drop with age, especially following the menopause, but there is no evidence that this should happen to women.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed when Tim Spector, professor of epidemiology at King’s College, London, looked at the effect of the menopause on women’s libido he found that sexual dysfunction problems didn’t increase but stayed constant, affecting around 22 per cent of women. Some women actually saw improvements in sexual function after the menopause.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The results of the four-year study, published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine in 2015, were ‘a little surprising’, Professor Spector admits. ‘They suggest that menopause has been exaggerated as an excuse for everything.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘By modifying your life and attitudes towards desire, you can change things sometimes surprisingly for the better, although you are older,’ he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any reduced libido is usually associated with hot flushes or vaginal dryness (which can make sex painful). ‘As oestrogen levels drop, there can be problems like vaginal dryness,’ says Kathy Abernethy, specialist menopause nurse and Chair of the British Menopause Society, adding that if these are treated, for example with hormone replacement therapy (HRT), oestrogen creams and lubricants, a woman can find her desire returns.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Hood says that women who maintain active sex lives are more likely to keep thinning and dryness at bay: ‘There’s a maxim, use it or lose it, which definitely applies to women having a great sex life past the menopause. Sexual intercourse helps to keep the walls of the vagina thicker and more elastic.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some doctors believe that a lack of sexual desire in women is linked to low levels of the male sex hormone, testosterone, which in women is produced in small amounts in the ovaries and drives sexual arousal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Testosterone patches deliver small amounts of a synthetic form of the hormone while testosterone creams can be used by peri and post-menopausal women on an ‘off-label’ basis (i.e. the drug has not been approved for that use).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Martin Galy, a hormone specialist practising in London, says that at least half of his female patients complaining of loss of sex drive have inadequate levels of testosterone. However, this is a controversial area, and Dr Galy admits that the science for what counts as ‘inadequate’ is ‘inexact’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘A woman’s testosterone levels could be very low and her libido is fine,’ he explains. ‘It works for some women, but not everyone.’ There are also a range of potential side-effects such as bone softening, hair loss and acne. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whatever the cause, the impact a lack of desire can have on women should not be underestimated, explains Denise Knowles, a sex and relationship counsellor for Relate. ‘A healthy sex life is good for your relationship and how you feel,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Sex stimulates the production of feel-good hormones dopamine and oxytocin, making you feel closer to your partner as well as improving blood flow, which helps keep the circulatory system in good shape and burning calories. There are all sorts of good reasons why you should take steps to foster your desire.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Hood says people do have to make an effort. She often sees couples where the woman complains she no longer feels spontaneous desire and the man complains his partner won’t initiate sex. ‘But perhaps we put too much emphasis on “spontaneous desire”, which only really happens in new relationships. After two years or so, spontaneity is replaced by a new cycle of desire, which requires him to initiate intimacy to which she can respond sexually.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is also very often a difference in libido between a man and woman, suggests Dr Hood. Generally speaking, one person, usually a woman, loses spontaneous desire, she has said previously. ‘They don’t think about sex that much, they don’t initiate it and don’t really feel like having it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But when they do have sex, they often enjoy it — they have what’s known as reactive sex drive.

I need to keep fit to do my shows. I do pilates three times a week (I have a very strong pelvic floor as a result) otherwise I’d look like a mushroom.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>GET YOUR FIVE A DAY?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m on the Paleo diet, so I eat lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. But I don’t always trust the word ‘organic’. Those foods are too expensive. It’s like eating the Prada of the food world.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>EVER DIETED?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yeah, every diet known to man. I went on a grapefruit diet 20 years ago and ended up in hospital. A few years ago, I just juiced, shovelling pounds of vegetables and fruit into a blender. I felt sick for a week. On the Paleo diet, I eat everything that once had a pulse.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>ANY VICES?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I work really hard — but I enjoy it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>ANY FAMILY AILMENTS?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, mental illness. My great grandmother and great aunt suffered from ‘agitation’, as it was called, and ended up in psychiatric hospitals.

They fled the Nazis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WORST ILLNESS?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’ve suffered depression most of my life. At times I felt so immobilised I thought there was something physically wrong. I manage it with medication and mindfulness. It led me to set up Frazzled cafes, free meetings at M&amp;S cafes for people who feel overwhelmed. You get tea and cookies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>EVER HAVE PLASTIC SURGERY?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, but only for my career.

Otherwise, I’d think it stupid.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>COPE WELL WITH PAIN?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m tough, really tough and I don’t have a lot of pain. But, if I did, I’d hit the medication pretty quick. I’m not one for sitting it out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>TRIED ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, it’s fabulous material for my shows. I’ve tried acupuncture, herbs, flower essences and healing. I’ve also done rebirthing: they put me in a bath tub and shouted at me to go through my own birth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>HANGOVER CURE?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I don’t really drink, apart from the occasional Martini.

So there has been some excitement about a drug called bremelanotide, which has just undergone successful phase 3 clinical trials in the US. Women, it seems, are increasingly losing interest in sex. Around a third of pre-menopausal women and half of older women report sexual problems, with lack of desire a main cause, according to the Sexual Advice Association. This is not a problem unique to women — around one in five men experience low libido at some point, but they definitely have the advantage when it comes to treatments, hence the excitement for bremelanotide.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>The Daily Mail</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Danny Hussain</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T00:20:34.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Female Viagra called bremelanotide could have been found</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T00:20:34.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5543179/Sisters-law-birth-day-hours-apart-other.html" title="Look who I bumped into on the labour ward!

She was also chronically tired and lacking in energy. Yet the numerous doctors — including a private dermatologist — she saw during this time failed to find what was causing it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All manner of diagnoses were considered, from scabies and allergies to lymph cancer. It was only in February this year that she finally got a diagnosis, with a simple <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-27657110-3159-11e8-b0d2-ad146aff4764">NHS</a> blood test. This proved that her itching was due to a vitamin deficiency, a lack of vitamin B12, a relatively common cause of itching, albeit one that some experts say isn’t always considered by doctors.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Within hours of her first B12 injection Paulein’s itch improved. While relieved she also felt angry that she’d had to put up with the problem for so long.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact the British Association of Dermatologists has recently drawn up new guidelines to prevent others whose lives are blighted by a chronic itch having to wait for a diagnosis as long as Paulein.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While we all have the occasional urge to itch, for one in six people pruritus, the medical term for itching, is a chronic problem lasting for more than six weeks. It can continue for months even years and can be very intense, says Dr Emma Wedgeworth, a consultant dermatologist and spokesperson for the British Skin Foundation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Living with a chronic itch can be as bad as living with chronic pain, according to a study in the Archives of Dermatology in 2011.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It impacts sleep and quality of life,’ adds Dr Wedgeworth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The itch sensation occurs along the same sensory nerves in the skin as pain, travelling to the spinal cord, explains Dr George Millington of the British Association of Dermatologists. There, the pain and itch pathways separate and travel to different parts of the brain where the sensation of itch is perceived.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">After a simple NHS blood test she eventually realised that her unbearable need to itch was because of vitamin deficiency</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The most common causes of a chronic itch are skin conditions such as eczema or urticaria [hives],’ he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some people are more prone to chronic itching — for instance, it’s more common with age, as the skin becomes drier says Dr Millington.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The problem is that itching without a rash can be a result of many conditions, not just skin complaints, so GPs are often not sure at first what the cause might be.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the more common non-skin related causes of itching is iron deficiency anaemia, says Dr Wedgeworth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why this form of anaemia should cause itching is unclear, but when people with anaemia itch it can cause redness and bumps that look like rashes, which confuses the diagnosis. Blood tests can confirm iron-deficiency anaemia and it can be treated with iron pills.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Paulein’s itch was due to a different form of anaemia, pernicious anaemia, which led to her B12 deficiency and the itching. Most common in the over 60s, pernicious anaemia is an autoimmune condition caused by antibodies destroying a protein needed for the absorption of vitamin B12.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This can give rise to itching because B12 is needed to form the fatty sheaths that cover nerves. If these don’t form correctly it can affect the way nerve impulses are transmitted and this can lead to the sensation of itch, says Dr Moez Dungarwalla a consultant haematologist at Milton Keynes University Hospital. Confusingly for doctors, patients with pernicious anaemia are prone to the skin condition psoriasis, which can also cause itching, he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An underactive thyroid gland can cause an itch too says Dr Wedgeworth as the condition leads to dry skin. As can liver problems, because they lead to a build-up of bile under the skin. When kidneys fail, a build-up of wastes in the blood can sometimes cause itching.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Rarely it may also be a sign of certain types of cancer such as lymphoma (cancer of the lymph system),’ says Dr Wedgeworth. This can cause a rash and itching as the cancer encourages the production of chemicals called cytokines which irritate the nerves in the skin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Paulein’s itch began in 2015, it started on her back and forearms and spread to her trunk. The itching became so bad that she couldn’t sleep at night and she went to the doctor who told her she had scabies, a contagious skin disease caused by an infestation of the ‘itch mite’ sarcoptes scabiei.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s directly transferred from skin to skin and a relentless unbearable itch is the main symptom as the mites burrow under the skin and lay eggs. As well as itching it can cause a rash.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her doctor sent her to the pharmacy for cream. This made no difference and four days later she went back to the GP. This time she was told she had an allergy and was given antihistamines.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But again, they didn’t work,’ Paulein recalls. ‘I was in agony with indescribable itching. I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t think. I used to belong to groups and loved painting cat portraits and playing the piano. I could do none of this any more because of the itching and inability to sleep. I was slumped on the sofa all day.’ Three weeks later, during another consultation with her GP this time by telephone, he suggested she see a private dermatologist — who just looked at Paulein’s skin and told her she probably had lymphoma.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I was absolutely stunned,’ Paulein says. ‘I was so upset that I actually fell silent and wasn’t able to communicate. No other tests had been run and yet she was giving me this diagnosis of a type of cancer. I was devastated.’</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Several doctors and all manner of diagnoses were considered, from scabies and allergies to lymph cancer</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was referred for a CT scan and blood tests. It was not lymphoma. These private tests and scans cost Paulein £1,200.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I was relieved, of course, not to have cancer,’ she says. ‘But I was also angry. I’d gone private but still no one had an answer. By now the itching was so bad I wasn’t sleeping at all.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She had no choice but to put up with her symptoms, trying to manage with E45 cream.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then this February, three years after her symptoms began, she went to her GP surgery for a routine blood pressure check-up. She saw a different doctor and mentioned her itching.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The doctor said: “Let’s run a blood test.” I felt so disillusioned with the medical profession that I remember thinking there was no point after 23 previous blood tests coming back negative. But I went anyway,’ says Paulein.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When she went back for her results, the doctor finally had a diagnosis: pernicious anaemia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘After three years of hell and so many invasive tests and misdiagnoses, at last I had an answer.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The condition is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency. Other causes include diet — vegans and vegetarians can sometimes become deficient as they do not eat foods such as meat, eggs, milk, and cheese which are rich in B12 — parasitic infections, and drugs such as metformin used for diabetes. It is also more common in elderly patients.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other symptoms include tingling, itching, tongue soreness, fatigue and general weakness, low mood, jaundice and brittle nails.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new British Association of Dermatologists guidelines say that all patients with chronic pruritus should have a full blood test to check things such as their iron and B12 levels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We are becoming more aware that chronic itching is a problem, which is why we produced the guidelines,’ says Dr Nick Levell, president of the British Association of Dermatologists. ‘It has highlighted how many unanswered questions there are about the causes of itching, and the shortage of treatments available.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Three days after her blood test result Paulein had her first vitamin B12 injection.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Within hours of getting home I felt less fatigued and was able to get off the sofa,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But most of all, I was itching a lot less. It was still itchy, but more bearable. It was an incredible transformation.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Paulein needs a vitamin B12 injection every month initially, though she may need more frequent doses.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I hope telling my experience will help others who might be in a similar situation with similar symptoms to ensure they push for a diagnosis.’ </p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Lunch cruncher: How to make your calories go further </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just two small Scotch eggs add up to more than 500 calories, which aren’t calories well spent when you consider you could have scrambled eggs on toast, yoghurt, fruit and popcorn instead. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The second lunch is also healthier — it has around a third less cholesterol-raising saturated fat (6.4g versus 9.8g) and is lower in blood pressure-raising salt (1.5g versus 1.8g).

Her need to scratch was so intense that she was unable to sleep and her body was covered in weeping wounds. ‘I was awake all the time, scratching,’ says Paulein, 72, from Epping, Essex who runs a craft business with her 65-year-old husband Robert. She was also chronically tired and lacking in energy. Yet the numerous doctors — including a private dermatologist — she saw during this time failed to find what was causing it. All manner of diagnoses were considered, from scabies and allergies to lymph cancer. It was only in February this year that she finally got a diagnosis, with a simple NHS blood test. This proved that her itching was due to a vitamin deficiency, a lack of vitamin B12, a relatively common cause of itching, albeit one that some experts say isn’t always considered by doctors.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>The Daily Mail</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Danny Hussain</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T08:00:39.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Craft business owner found her itching was due to a vitamin deficiency</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T08:00:39.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5547087/Single-jab-help-treat-multiple-allergies-including-hay-fever.html" title="Single jab containing a cocktail of six different allergens will help treat multiple allergies including hay fever "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5547139/Experts-review-gadgets-help-eye-symptoms.html" title="The gadgets that help you keep an eye on your own symptoms - just like a real doctor: So from lung disease to heart problems and gout, which are the ones experts say are worth buying? "></link></item><item><title>From wrinkles to liver spots to crows' feet: How your skin will change as you age - and how to deal with it</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5545449/How-skin-change-age-deal-it.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 14:51:45 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5545449</guid><description><![CDATA[Ageing skin has a big impact on self-esteem - we spend nearly $5 billion per year on skin care.

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Michelle Rodrigues, a dermatologist in Melbourne, demystifies the changes you will face over time, why some are more prone to certain changes than others, and how to treat each thing</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Intrinsic ageing of the skin</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rates of intrinsic (also known as chronologic) ageing are predicted, to a degree, by our genetic makeup, including our skin colour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With age, the epidermis (the top layer of the skin) becomes thinner and more transparent. This means that it reflects less light and so appears less luminous as time goes on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The epidermis may also start to develop growths, including small brown dots (dermatosis papulosa nigra and seborrhoic keratoses) and overgrown oil glands, as well as spots that result from ultra-violet (UV) light exposure such as lentigines (freckles), melasma (pigmentation), solar keratoses (sun spots) and skin cancers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our dermis (the layer of skin under the epidermis) loses collagen and elastin as we age, causing the skin to sag and develop wrinkles when our muscles move under the skin. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The blood vessels in the dermis also become thinner, which leads to easy bruising. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And because the dermis and epidermis are thinner and hence closer together as we age, the blood vessels become more visible on the surface of the skin with time.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The reason collagen decreases as we age is complex, but is partly due to the reduced function of the cells that make collagen (fibroblasts) and an increase in the enzyme that breaks down collagen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Research has also shown that fat is lost and bone is resorbed from different compartments of the face at different rates, and this affects our perceived age.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When fat disappears from under the eyes (usually in our 20s or 30s), a dark shadow appears, making us look tired. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And as the fat pad around the cheeks moves downwards (in our 30s and 40s), lines are created that extend outwards from the nose. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Decreases in collagen and elastin cause frown lines and crows feet to develop, alongside other dynamic wrinkles (wrinkles from muscle movement). </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

Our lifestyle, environment and habits also play a role in skin ageing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Extrinsic ageing of the skin</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Extrinsic ageing can be induced by environmental factors such as UV exposure, smoking and air pollution. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This means the skin's apparent age and its chronological age are not always the same.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">UV light breaks down elastin in the dermis, causing saggy, stretchy skin. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The skin also bruises and tears more easily and takes longer to heal with ongoing exposure to UV rays.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">This is a pulse oximeter that can be used to monitor patients by measuring the amount of oxygen in the blood</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an umbrella term for lung diseases such as emphysema and bronchitis, may want to monitor their lung function.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">THE TEST: Pulse oximeters are used widely in hospitals. They measure the amount of oxygen in the blood by checking levels of a protein called haemoglobin. Levels can drop for several reasons, including some lung problems; it can happen when there is a flare-up of symptoms or as a condition deteriorates.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One pulse oximeter that can be used at home is the Beurer PO30 (£49.99, stressnomore.co.uk). You place the tip of your finger into a small device that looks a bit like a bulldog clip. This passes beams of infrared and red light through your finger to a detector.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Infrared light is absorbed by haemoglobin carrying oxygen, while red light is absorbed by haemoglobin that isn’t carrying oxygen. The device calculates the amount of oxygen in the blood according to the amount of each type of light reaching the detector.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Blood oxygen levels of less than 94 per cent suggest you may require treatment with extra oxygen or that your current treatment may need increasing — and you might need to contact your GP or specialist.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This device is not currently supplied for home use by the NHS.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Expert opinion: ‘While some patients with COPD and asthma quite like the idea of having an oxygen saturation number, for most it doesn’t provide any useful information,’ says Dr Steve Holmes, a GP and regional clinical chair for the British Lung Foundation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Patients with asthma and COPD will often experience symptoms [such as breathlessness and feeling tired] a day or more before oxygen levels fall, so this won’t help you predict the early stages of an asthma attack or COPD exacerbation, as you would already know that your condition was deteriorating by the time you noticed a drop in oxygen levels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It can, however, help a few people — and clinicians would normally advise on this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Importantly, if someone becomes too fixated on readings, they could be falsely reassured and not seek medical help when they need it.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="health-ccox">Verdict</span></strong>: Not worth it.</p><div>

However, this can be affected by diet and alcohol.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">THE TEST: Doctors monitor clotting levels using the international normalised ratio (INR), a number that reflects the time it takes for the patient’s blood to clot compared with a healthy sample.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Traditionally, testing is done in GP surgeries every few months, but devices such as the CoaguChek INRange (£467.87, medisave.co.uk) allow patients to do this at home. Using a lancing device, a drop of blood from your finger is placed on a strip inserted into a mobile-phone-sized reader, which displays the result after a minute.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You then ring your doctor or nurse for advice on adjusting your medication.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While patients have to buy the device, the test strips can be prescribed on the NHS, though this varies around the country.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is the only device of its kind that has been assessed by NICE.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Expert opinion: ‘Home INR testing offers convenience for patients and has the potential to save time,’ says Maureen Talbot, a senior cardiac nurse with the British Heart Foundation. ‘However, it’s important that it’s also affordable for all patients.’ The technology, she adds, is generally reliable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Verdict</strong>: May be worth it — but the cost could make it prohibitive for many.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Pressure test for glaucoma</strong></p><div class="mol-img-group floatRHS" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Certain antibodies may be able to remove Alzheimer’s plaques from the brain, according to new research carried about in mice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As much as 20 years before the symptoms of Alzheimer’s set in, people with the disease begin to develop amyloid beta plaques that build up in the brain and, scientists believe, interfere with neural signals to cause cognitive and memory losses.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But researchers at Washington University School of Medicine have developed an antibody that can remove the proteins these plaques are made of altogether, according to their new research. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Several recent clinical trials have tried to use antibodies to target the plaques, but none have gotten past these trial phases, and many treatments have come with unsustainable side effects.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new approach may offer a way around these side effects and stop Alzheimer’s plaques before its heart-breaking symptoms begin, the researchers hope.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Antibodies (red) target and bind to a smaller protein within the amyloid beta proteins plaques (blue) that clog the brains of Alzheimer's sufferers. The antibody clears the whole protein away</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on Alzheimer’s disease each year, we are still largely helpless against the disease once it sets in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We now know some of the key genetics behind the disease, as well as the key biological marker of it in the brain: the amyloid beta protein plaques.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These plaques are composed of pieces of protein that come from the fatty membranes that coat neuron cells.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Normally, if these fragments break off, naturally occurring enzymes can break them so that they do not have a chance to turn into a clump.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For whatever reason, this natural waste removal does not seem to happen in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Scientists suspect that as these proteins build up and stick together – either wrapped around neurons or roaming freely through the brain – they block the electrical signals fired across the synapses different parts of the brain try to communicate with one another.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Academic researchers as well as pharmaceutical and biotech companies have looked to antibodies to target these plaques, but, recently, pharmaceutical giant Eli Lily had to drop the most promising drug it had been developing with this approach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Antibodies have specific identities that make them suited to fight particular invaders, or pathogens, in the blood.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new study experimented with an antibody that matches not the amyloid beta proteins themselves, but a smaller protein contained within them, called APOE.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Certain variations of the gene for APOE are the single greatest genetic predictor for Alzheimer as well, and the same research team had previously found that they could mitigate some of the damage done by amyloid beta proteins by aiming treatment at the APOE protein.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, ultimately, the bigger goal in Alzheimer’s research is to stop, undo or even prevent the development of the plaques in order to stop Alzheimer’s.</p><div class="mol-article-quote floatRHS health" id="mol-292b50e0-3141-11e8-99c2-afacc5e979f3">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper

class="mol-article-quote-attribution"><div>Dr Holtzman </div></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">So the team designed an experiment to see if they could use APOE for a search-and-destroy purpose, rather than just a containment one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They tested a number of antibodies that were good fits for human APOE, which they had given to mice, along with Alzheimer’s plaques.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once the antibodies made it to their target proteins, they acted like beacons, calling the attention of other immune cells to come joint the attack against small protein and the whole vicious protein it sat inside.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The performance of one of these antibodies was particularly impressive. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over the course of six weeks, the level of amyloid beta proteins in the mice treated with HAE-4 fell to half what they had been prior to treatment. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The antibody was able to pick out the APOE protein, and, when it dislodged it, take the rest of the larger amyloid protein with it.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The researchers had worried that, because APOE plays an important role in eliminating fats and cholesterol from the blood stream, attacking the protein could have collateral damage for its helpful purpose too.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, 'it turns out that the APOE in the plaques has a different structure than the form of APOE found in the blood,' senior study author Dr David Holtzman said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The HAE-4 antibody recognized only the form found attached to the plaques in the brain,' which meant it would not target the helpful blood proteins. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It also did not seem to cause the same inflammation that other antibodies had induced by targeting the larger amyloid proteins. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The anti-amyloid antibodies are going to be binding to most of the molecules that are in the plaque, but the anti-APOE antibody would target just a very small component of the plaque,' said Dr Holtzman. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This means we may find less immune activation, and we might not see the unwelcome side effects,' he added. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the treatment works as well in humans as it did in the experiments in mice, it may well provide a more effective and safe key therapy those whose brains 'build up amyloid over many years and...just can't get rid of it,' said Dr Holtzman.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'By removing plaques, if we start early enough, we may be able to stop the changes to the brain that result in forgetfulness, confusion and cognitive decline,' he said. </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>On the heals of failed attempts by major pharmaceutical makers, Washington University scientists cut levels of

</div><div class="clear"></div><p class="imageCaption">Registered dietitian-nutritionist Vanessa Rissetto said she doesn't see how skim milk is a much better alternative than whole milk</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1. Skim milk is not better than whole milk</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Registered dietitian-nutritionist Vanessa Rissetto said she'd only recommend skim milk, which contains zero grams of fat, to clients who consume a lot of milk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is in an effort to reduce calorie consumption.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She'd also recommend it to people if whole milk bothers their stomach, but other than that she doesn't see how skim milk is more beneficial than whole milk. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, research has shown there are more health benefits associated with drinking whole milk than skim milk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A 2016 study published in the journal Circulation found that people who ate or drank full-fat dairy products had a 46 percent lower risk of developing diabetes than those who consumed low-fat or skimmed milk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although the researchers couldn't explain exactly why full-fat dairy led to a reduced risk of developing diabetes, they believed that the saturated fats, vitamin D, and omega-3 fats found in dairy may have defended them against insulin resistance <span style="font-size: 16px;">and helped control body weight.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Also, fat helps people feel full longer. And when people cut out fat, they tend to replace it with sugar and carbohydrates to satisfy their hunger. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, another 2016 study published in the American Journal of Nutrition revealed that women who consumed the most high-fat dairy products had an eight percent reduced risk of being overweight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Researchers of this study said it could be to do with the fact that the vitamin D, proteins and calcium in dairy appear to help keep energy metabolism moving.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nutritionist Julie Upton warns it is not cut and dry. Skim milk does have clear benefits, she says, since it contains less saturated fat and calories, which drive up levels of  LDL cholesterol and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rissetto said that while skim milk may be beneficial for people concerned about their heart health, switching from whole milk wouldn't make a significant impact to a person's diet or calorie intake unless they drink multiple glasses of milk a day, otherwise they're just depriving themselves of the benefits of whole milk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. 'Gluten-free does not equal good for me'</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While many gluten-free products, like bread and pastries are touted as healthy, Upton said these foods are high in added sugars, saturated fat and calories. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said a growing number of people think gluten-free products are healthier alternatives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, a 2017 study conducted by Mayo Clinic found that more than three million people in the US are avoiding  gluten -  proteins found in grains such as wheat, barley, rye.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Approximately 72 percent of those people on a gluten-free diet don't  have celiac disease or a sensitivity to the protein.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They think "Oh, Miley Cyrus doesn't eat it so I'm not going to eat it,"' Upton said. 'Unless you have celiac disease, there's no clinical reason to avoid gluten.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gluten is responsible for the shape and texture of baked goods - it is what makes bread so soft and chewy. Upton said when this protein is removed, it's substituted with sugar and chemicals to make up for the lost of the protein.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Upton also noted that these products lack necessary nutrients.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, a study published earlier this year in the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics found that, with the exception of crackers, gluten-free foods contained more fat, salt and sugar than their gluten-containing equivalents and also had lower fiber and protein content.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Furthermore, another 2013 study revealed that people on gluten-free diets had an inadequate amount of nutrients, including  folate, vitamin A, magnesium, calcium and iron.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So before you cut gluten out of your life, check with your doctor first to see if you have a gluten allergy or sensitivity,' she said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. Frozen fruits and vegetables may contain more nutrients than fresh produce</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fresh isn't always best when it comes to produce.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That's because it's constant degrading nutrients as days go by.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So by the time it's purchased at a market, taken home and finally eaten, it may have fewer nutrients than frozen fruits or vegetables.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'That "fresh" food may have been in transit for weeks,' Upton said. 'And the more days it foes without being eaten the more nutrients it loses.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, freezing fruits and vegetables preserves vitamins and minerals and stops this nutritional depletion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Furthermore, a 2017 study published in the Journal of Food Composition and Analysis found 'frozen produce outperformed “fresh-stored” more frequently than “fresh-stored” outperformed frozen' when assessing nutrient and vitamin contents.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In other words, frozen food may have just as much or more greater nutritional value than its frozen counterparts. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4. Agave sweetener vs refined table sugar</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many people think Agave sweetener and coconut sugar are healthier alternatives to refined sugar.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is less likely to cause blood sugar spikes due to it having a lower glycemic index - a value that determines how slowly or how quickly those foods cause increases in blood glucose levels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, Upton said that despite this, Agave sweetener and sugar contain virtually the same amount of calories per teaspoon.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There's no appreciable difference between regular table sugar and natural sugars on the market,' Upton said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I see so many people going for coconut sugar but it's not going to be a healthier alternative to table sugar,' she added.    </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Registered dietitian-nutritionists Vanessa Rissetto and Julie Upton break down which 'healthy' alternatives aren't that much better for you than their counterparts.

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Hum Fleming, 28 pictured, suffers from epilepsy and says she has seizures once or twice a month</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hum Fleming was just 13 when epilepsy first announced its presence in her life. Watching television at the family home in Oxfordshire with her father, Roddie, she suddenly experienced what can best be described as an ‘out-of-body experience’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I felt everything go out of focus,’ says Hum (short for Hermione).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘At the time, I was learning about near‑death experiences in Religious Studies at school and that was exactly how I felt — as though I was watching myself from outside my body.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I honestly thought I was having a heart attack and dying. I was having palpitations and panicking, but I couldn’t move.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The next minute I’m back in the room, saying to my dad: “Something just happened to me.” But I couldn’t tell him what because I didn’t know.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I burst into tears and he was looking at me, white as a sheet and dribbling slightly, saying: “What’s up, Humster?”’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just as suddenly the tears return now, over a pot of tea in a Central London cafe. A decade-and-a-half has passed since that day, but the memory, and the prolonged period of confusion which ensued, still cuts deep.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even that simple word — memory — must come with a caveat. Hum, now a 28-year-old fashion PR, cannot actually remember what happened that day but has pieced it together from information others have provided.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While her memories before then remain intact (‘As a kid, I was like a computer — names, dates, I could give you instant recall on anything’), everything since then is enveloped in impenetrable fog.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her long-term memory has gone, leaving her with good recollection of the past six weeks to six months, but a blank space prior to that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today she suffers just one or two seizures a month, thanks to effective medication and leading what she describes as a ‘responsible’ lifestyle. When she has one of these episodes, as they’re known, she looks ‘absent’, pale and maybe dribbles a bit, she explains.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is unlike the more typical seizures of epilepsy, associated with loss of consciousness, stiffened muscles and jerky movements.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Epilepsy is an umbrella term; the experience can vary hugely for different people,’ she says. ‘My main side-effect, the thing which has affected my life the most, is accelerated forgetting.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style"><div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div><div class="clear"></div><p class="imageCaption">She is the great niece of James Bond author Ian Fleming and is fronting a new campaign to raise awareness about epilepsy</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The difficult thing for me is trying to measure what I have forgotten, because how could I possibly know? I’ve forgotten what I’ve forgotten!’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This last statement is delivered with a giggle. A natural optimist, Hum tackles the issue head on, which is one of the reasons she has teamed up with the charity Young Epilepsy to raise awareness of the true impact of this condition in a new campaign, In The Moment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Launched this week, it is encouraging those affected, their friends and family to talk about the ‘moment’ epilepsy changed their lives for ever.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of nerve cells misfire. In most cases, as with Hum, it’s not clear what causes its onset, but these episodes can leave scars on the brain, with loss of memory one of the most common problems for which people with epilepsy seek help.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It occurs as a result of damage to the temporal lobe of the brain — specifically the hippocampus — where short-term memories are converted into long-term ones.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hum admits to being ‘relieved’ when she was finally diagnosed at the age of 15. This came after a battery of tests over two years. By that stage, she was having around three episodes a week. Initially, they were thought to stem from blood pressure, heart issues or panic attacks. ‘We’d reached the point where the words “brain tumour” were being bandied around, which was pretty terrifying,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Oddly, it was such a relief to have the label of epilepsy rather than endlessly trying to explain I wasn’t just some hysterical girl.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hum readily admits to being fortunate that her family had the resources to seek out the best doctors. She is the great-niece of James Bond’s creator Ian Fleming, while her father runs the Fleming &amp; Partners bank, and she counts the likes of Lady Kitty Spencer and fashion darling Millie Mackintosh among her closest friends.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Health, however, is a great leveller, and as a teenager Hum was on a steep learning curve.</p><div class="mol-img-group floatRHS" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">She did well in exams because of her short-term memory but admits she can't remember her dissertation</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘My only understanding of epilepsy at the time — so old-fashioned and uneducated — was that it was someone frothing at the mouth on the ground who couldn’t look at flashing lights.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I’m afraid that’s how an awful lot of people still see it. Actually, while around one in 100 people is epileptic, only 4 per cent of those are photosensitive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘For many of us, it’s an invisible condition, which brings a different set of challenges.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At her boarding school in Oxfordshire, Hum was open about her condition. Her twin, Chloe, was ‘hugely supportive’. Though they are not identical, the sisters are extremely close, and as children they would trick gullible adults into believing they were telepathic by always answering ‘44’ when asked to think of a number.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thanks to her short-term memory, Hum did well in her exams and went on to study history of art at university. But when I ask about her dissertation, however, I am met with a blank look.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘This is what it’s like for me every day,’ she says. ‘I couldn’t even name any of the artists I studied. It’s a good thing I’ve gone into fashion PR as it’s always looking to the next season. For a future‑focused person like me, that’s ideal.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This positive attitude can come across as fearlessness, but Hum admits to a certain vulnerability.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Even in normal conversations, I can have this knot of anxiety in my stomach because people are talking about things I should know but I’ve forgotten.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I see people I might have known for years but I’ve no idea who they are. I even introduced myself to a cousin once.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Oddly enough, I’m almost more comfortable socialising with strangers than my oldest friends, because I don’t have to pretend to know things which I don’t.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hum has been able to control her condition through medication, though this hasn’t always been straightforward. At one point she was prescribed levetiracetam, which reduces the transmission of nerve signals in the brain.

Kind-hearted strangers continued to donate and now she has raised £81,000 towards a drug called Bevacizumab, also known as Avastin.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Four months after she was diagnosed with bowel cancer, Fiona Backler, 55, had died. For a year she’d complained of agonising stomach pains, going back and forth to her GP several times, to be told it was ‘probably’ kidney stones.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By December 2014, she was waiting to find out when her hospital appointment with a specialist for further tests would be. But then the pain became so unbearable she went to A&amp;E, believing she might finally get treatment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, she was told she had bowel cancer which had spread to her liver. A week later she was told that the cancer was so advanced she had only a year to live.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The news came as a complete shock to Fiona, husband Peter, 59, and their children David, 34, Lauren, 27, and Scott, 23. ‘Bowel cancer just wasn’t on our radar,’ says trainee teacher Lauren, who lives in Eastbourne, East Sussex. ‘Mum was health-conscious — she never smoked, for example. When she told me I burst into tears, but she told me to be brave.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I thought if anyone could fight this it would be her, but this was not something I would have imagined in my wildest dreams. Mum went downhill very quickly,’ adds Lauren. ‘There was no time for her to go into a hospice.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After lung cancer, bowel cancer is the UK’s second biggest cancer killer — around 16,000 people die from it each year. If caught early, at stage one, patients have a 97 per cent survival rate for at least five years, but discovered later, at stage four, this falls to just 5 per cent for men and 10 per cent for women. Around a quarter of cases are only diagnosed once the symptoms are so bad the patient goes to A&amp;E.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A recent study found women are much more likely to have their cancer picked up this way despite frequent trips to their doctor beforehand — because GPs can mistake the symptoms for gynaecological problems. Researchers at University College London found 34 per cent of women are diagnosed in A&amp;E, like Fiona was. They found 30 per cent of men were diagnosed this way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Over 80 per cent of people with this cancer initially have vague symptoms such as changes in bowel habits and bloating, which can mean it goes undetected,’ says Andrew Renehan, a professor of cancer studies and surgery at The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Major signs — blood in the stools, changes in bowel movements, persistent lower abdominal pain — can also be caused by other less severe conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome or haemorrhoids.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, bowel cancer screening is offered to those aged 60 to 74 — in Scotland, it’s from 50. Last weekend the BBC news presenter George Alagiah said that his bowel cancer could have been caught earlier if the screening programme in England was the same as in Scotland. He was first diagnosed four years ago, at the age of 58; last Christmas he was told that the cancer had returned and it’s now stage 4.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Had they had screening at 50, like they do in Scotland. I would have been screened at least three times and possibly four by the time I was 58 and this would have been caught at the stage of a little polyp: snip, snip.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I have thought, why have the Scots got it and we don’t?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More than one in ten of the 41,000 cases diagnosed annually are in the 50-59 age group.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Mr Alagiah says he is unlikely to survive the next five years and said: ‘I have thought, why have the Scots got it and we don’t?’</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last year, the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service-Cancer Research UK partnership published data which showed that bowel cancers diagnosed through screening are more likely to be found at stage one, compared with other routes to diagnosis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Scotland, around three in ten bowel cancers at ages 50-59 were detected via the screening programme. ‘The evidence from Scotland is that there is a 27 per cent reduction in bowel cancer mortality among those individuals who take up screening,’ says Professor Renehan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The main screening method is the faecal occult blood test (FOBT), which looks for hidden blood in stools. It is posted to people in the age range every two years — they then post a sample back. The test can generate false positives — it can be affected by factors such as taking aspirin. Uptake, at around 58 per cent, isn’t as high as hoped, partly because some people are squeamish about doing it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lauren says her mother would definitely have taken up the option of screening at 50 had she been offered it. ‘Mum was very vigilant about her health,’ she recalls.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘She warned me to never put off going to the doctor if I felt unwell, and frequently told me about the importance of going for cervical screening. She definitely would have done this right away, and that’s the painful thing — I know that, but it wasn’t available to her.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lauren has channelled her ‘immense grief and rage’ into a petition to lower the screening age in the rest of the UK to 50. It has over 400,000 signatures.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But why this discrepancy in the first place? ‘When the pilot scheme in the UK was started in 2003-4, the National Screening Committee suggested to the NHS that it should start at 50,’ says Lauren. Scotland followed that when they launched screening in 2007, yet when screening began in England the year before, pilots had shown lower uptake among 50-59 year olds, so the decision was made to start it later.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The biggest barrier to screening at 50 is the provision of follow-up testing with a colonoscopy, suggests Professor Renehan. If the FOBT picks up blood, an appointment at a screening centre with a specialist nurse follows.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The next step is a colonoscopy — where a camera is inserted into the large bowel. Each costs the NHS £372 and the argument is that screening younger people would mean more colonoscopies — some needlessly, after false positives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2016 in England alone, 302,643 patients were referred for urgent investigations for suspected bowel cancer by their GP, with most having colonoscopies — 95 per cent did not have the disease.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, a study that will involve 6,000 people could better identify those who need this further testing. Led by the Croydon Health Service NHS Trust, the aim is to halve colonoscopies by 2020 by using a much more accurate screening test.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The fecal immunochemical (FIT) test has been used in Scotland since early 2017. It detects human blood more accurately, avoiding false positives — for instance when someone eats steak, it can lead to animal blood traces in their stool affecting test results.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is also more sensitive to a smaller amount of human blood than FOBT, so can detect cancers at an earlier stage. And because it can record the presence of blood in just one gram of sample — FOBT requires a few given over a number of days — Beating Bowel Cancer has estimated up to 7 per cent more people will complete the test.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The charities Beating Bowel Cancer and Bowel Cancer UK, which merged earlier this year, have launched a campaign to lower the age of cancer screening in England and Wales to 50.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Until things change, Lauren won’t stop campaigning. ‘I saw a man on TV who had moved to Scotland for his job. He’d been screened earlier, therefore his life was saved,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Hearing this made me more determined. I’ll grieve for ever, but I want to stop other families going through what mine has.’</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Four months after she was diagnosed with bowel cancer, Fiona Backler, 55, had died.

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Skipping meals can lead to weight gain in the long term, according to a new study</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Researchers, led by nutritional therapist Ulla Kärkkäinen, collected data from more than 4,900 young men and women. The participants answered surveys mapping out factors impacting weight and weight change when they were 24 years of age, and again ten years later at the age of 34.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They found that most participants gained weight during the decade-long study, while only <span style="font-size: 16px;">7.5 percent of women and 3.8 percent of men lost weight.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over the 10 years the average weight gain in women was just under two pounds per year and in men, 2.2 pounds. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kärkkäinen and her colleagues said one of the common factors among young women and men who succeeded in managing their weight in the long term was eating food regularly as opposed to dieting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Often, people try to prevent and manage excess weight and obesity by dieting and skipping meals. In the long term, such approaches seem to actually accelerate getting fatter, rather than prevent it,'  Kärkkäinen said.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">This isn't the first study to show this link. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Research published in a 2015 issue of The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry found that skipping meals not only leads to weight gain, it can increase the risk of insulin resistance and  type 2 diabetes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A similar study published in 2013 by the Oregon Research Institute found that limiting calorie intake increases the risk of weight gain by making unhealthy food more attractive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The current study concludes that the cornerstone of successful weight management is refraining from dieting and observing regular eating habits, in both women and men.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Generally speaking, weight management guidance often boils down to eating less and exercising more.

I was told to stop exercising until the faulty valve could be replaced, since exercise was exacerbating it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The cardiologist explained that, usually, replacing the aortic valve means cutting through the chest with an incision of up to 30 cm, and a recovery time of up to six months, which was daunting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But then he said he could refer me to a surgeon who could replace the valve through minimally invasive surgery, with a much faster recovery. I saw the consultant, Toufan Bahrami, in September.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Before he had the implant put in, the teacher said that he couldn’t run 100m without having to rest</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">He explained that he could replace it through a small incision. Usually the valve is replaced with a mechanical one made of titanium, which means you have to take blood-thinning drugs for life to stop clots forming around it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Mr Bahrami said he was also using a new valve made from tissue — from a cow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not only does it mean you don’t need blood-thinners, but it also fits neatly into the aorta in the same place as the damaged valve so doesn’t need to be stitched into place — this would mean the recovery time is faster, and I could be back at work within weeks instead of six months.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I had the surgery in December at Harefield Hospital, just outside London. I only needed to stay in hospital for a week, with just some discomfort on the first day, for which I took codeine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Three weeks after the surgery I could walk 15km and by four weeks, I was able to go for my first gentle jog, which was amazing. Now just three months after the operation I can run 10km non-stop with no ill-effects — and I was back at work after six weeks.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>THE SURGEON</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Toufan Bahrami is a consultant cardiac surgeon at the Royal Brompton &amp; Harefield NHS Foundation Trust.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are around 20,000 heart valve procedures in Britain each year — 15,000 involve aortic valves, usually because the aortic valve, which opens to allow the blood to flow from the heart around the rest of the body, has stiffened and narrowed as a result of a build-up of calcium. This can happen because of damage linked to rheumatic disease in childhood (calcium in the blood can slowly build up on the scar tissue) or simply because calcium builds upon the valve with age.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other valves such as the mitral valve can become calcified, too, but the aortic valve is more prone to it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The valve looks like three tissue flaps sitting on a base: these flaps open to allow oxygenated blood to flow through, and close to stop it flowing back. If the flaps become rigid and fail to let enough blood through, patients feel tired and breathless — they may also feel dizzy as the brain isn’t getting enough blood.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, the muscle of the heart has to work harder to compensate and thickens, so the cavity of the heart becomes smaller, making the problem worse.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This valve should open to 1.5 sq cm to let blood flow through: when it becomes calcified and can only open to under 1 sq cm we need to replace it. Mike’s was only opening to around 0.7 sq cm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The standard way to replace narrowed valves is with a sternotomy, making a 20 to 30cm incision in the chest. We also have to use a heart-lung bypass machine to stop the heart for 45 to 60 minutes. All this means the patient faces a long recovery.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">There are around 20,000 heart valve procedures in Britain each year — 15,000 involve aortic valves, like the procedure on Mr Adamson</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">At Harefield we now implant most valves, including mechanical ones, minimally invasively — usually we only need a 6cm incision. But this goes through the breastbone, which means a recovery time of up to two months. The valves need to be sutured in place, using 30 to 40 stitches.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’re now using the new Edwards Intuity valve, which doesn’t need stitches as it’s held in place by a fibrous ring at the base of where the original valve was.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the incision, which is 6cm, goes between the ribs. This means a quicker recovery, with many patients back to work within four weeks. And because it doesn’t need suturing, patients spend just 15 to 20 minutes on a heart-lung machine, so the risks are lower. The difference with the new valve is that it’s fixed to a stent (a tube-like mesh) made of stainless steel. This ‘anchors’ it under the fibrous ring. The operation takes 90 minutes to two hours, around an hour faster than the traditional valve procedure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">First, we make a 6cm incision between the ribs and a 2cm incision in the femoral artery and in the femoral vein — both in the groin — to attach the patient to a heart-lung bypass machine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Working between the ribs, I open the aorta and expose the aortic valve. I remove all the calcium from around the fibrous ring (called the annulus) at the base of the valve, as well as the damaged flaps themselves. The new valve has three bovine tissue flaps supported by flexible alloy wire.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I then insert the collapsed stent into the left ventricle, the lower left chamber of the heart (the main pumping chamber). When it’s in place, I use a balloon to expand it, like an umbrella, so the new valve won’t shift.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Because it sits above the annulus we can use a much larger valve than with other valves, which is more efficient as it allows more oxygenated blood through — we have a range of sizes depending on the patient’s anatomy, which open to 1.3 to 2 sq cm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This valve should last around 15 to 20 years — shorter than a mechanical valve, but the risks are lower and the patient doesn’t need to be on warfarin for life, and it can be replaced easily. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> The procedure costs the NHS around £20,000 and a similar cost if done privately.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Techno Doc </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This week: Nanoneedle patch turns bad fat into good</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In future, slimming our wobbly bits could be as simple as slapping on a patch, suggest the results of a trial of a new device.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Reported in the journal ACS Nano, a study by researchers in North Carolina used patches covered in tiny needles to inject a substance into the fat under the skin to turn it from so-called ‘bad’ white fat into ‘good’ brown fat.

Side-effects of antihistamines can include drowsiness, dry mouth and blurred vision, while long-term use — more than three weeks — of steroids has been linked to an increased risk of health problems such as weight gain and muscle weakness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Immunotherapy, usually in the form of drops, can be given to those with severe allergies (typically to pollen) to try to make the immune system less reactive to a specific allergen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The conventional treatment involves being given small doses of one allergen. However this works only for one allergy and needs to be given at three monthly intervals for years.</p><div>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Winter can be a difficult time for runners, with the lack of daylight and sub-zero temperatures making that box set and glass of wine more tempting than thirty minutes spent jogging in the cold.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The problem is, not exercising during winter could contribute to a number of health problems, including seasonal affective disorder (SAD) – a type of <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-4b9f14a0-310e-11e8-b80b-8d4f571ff393">depression</a> linked to a lack of vitamin D from sunlight, as well as having less serotonin and dopamine in your body – the chemicals that make you feel good.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But if, like me, you find the sight of a treadmill inside a dimly lit gym tedious, and the fear of the middle age spread even harder to pallet, then there really isn’t much other option than getting outdoors and braving the cold.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There are not very many circumstances even in light clothing where you won’t warm up when producing that amount of heat, so you can go out and exercise in these conditions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘At rest, the body’s basal metabolism produces about 90-100 watts of heat. When running, depending on effort and fitness levels, this can increase to a kilowatt of heat – and at the maximum levels of human endurance it can product up to twice that.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So according to Professor Tipton, who studies the physiological and psychological responses to adverse environments, provided you’re working hard enough,  sub-zero temperatures is not a good enough excuse to skip the run and binge on Netflix.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

For example, if you ran for five minutes and walked for five minutes, you would get very cold, very quickly because you would stop producing heat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘And with damp clothing in windy conditions you’ll get cold very quickly – so I’d be much more inclined to recommend continuous activity.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That means High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), the staple of many runners’ regime gets the thumbs down because of the cooling effect associated with being static.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having put his advice to the test over two separate snowy runs, the benefits of continual running over interval training are obvious.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A steady or fast run along my normal route has me comfortably warm within a mile or so.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The next day, HIIT training, where I run at about 80 per cent effort for a minute before slowing down to a walk or half-pace jog has me immediately warm and then suddenly quite cold again.

While High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), the staple of many runners’ regime gets the thumbs down because of the cooling effect associated with being static in the cold.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Stephen Matthews</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T16:56:53.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Why the body's ability to generate heat is ideal for winter running</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T16:56:53.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.newbalance.co.uk/men/clothing/" title="Men's Clothing | Discover now at New Balance UK"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5458589/How-optimist-21-days.html" title="How to become an optimist in 21 days: Give your life the lift-off it needs and get into the happiness habit with these simple tips to rewire your brain"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://mile27.co.uk/" title="mile27.co.uk/"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254615000046" title="The effects of fluid loss on physical performance: A critical review - ScienceDirect"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5456533/Could-collagen-drink-REALLY-make-look-younger.html" title="Could a collagen drink REALLY make you look younger?
