And Russell Crowe (left) was hardly recognisable  as he attended his son's basketball game with his ex-wife Danielle Spencer (right, with Russell) in Malabar, Sydney on Thursday. The Gladiator star, 53, cut a relaxed figure in a loose-fitting black polo shirt and shorts as he enjoyed a family day out. The Australian actor swapped his signature Hollywood style for a bushy grey beard and sunglasses as he blended in with the crowds. Looking very different from his early 2000s heyday, Russell also shared a tender moment with his son (inset) at the family sports game. Later, he enjoyed a friendly conversation with Danielle, who is the mother of his two children, before driving away in his luxury car.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Joe Scrimshire</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T00:17:29.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Russell Crowe, 53, looks almost unrecognisable with a bushy grey beard</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T00:17:29.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5546437/Russell-Crowe-scar-arm-Gladiator-battle.html" title="Gladiator battle wound!

She also stated that she ‘was never a victim’ and that her coming forward was not part of the broader #MeToo movement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In perhaps the biggest bombshell from the interview, Daniels claimed that she was threatened in 2011 by an unknown man who told her to ‘leave Trump alone’ after she agreed to sell her story to the magazine In Touch Weekly. The man also appeared to subtly threaten Daniels after motioning to her infant daughter and stating that 'it would be a shame if something happened to her mom'. The incident left her ‘rattled’ but she declined to go to the police because she was too frightened about the ordeal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the explosive interview, Daniels also said that Trump told her not to worry about his wife Melania since they slept in separate rooms and that she viewed her relationship with Trump as primarily a business deal.

She also stated that she and Trump met in 2007 about a year after their reported affair in his private bungalow in Los Angeles, to discuss the details of a possible role for her on Celebrity Apprentice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Later, after agreeing to sell her story of the reported affair to In Touch Weekly in 2011, Daniels claimed to have been threatened by a mysterious man who was reportedly somehow linked to Trump. She subsequently denied a report on a celebrity gossip website of the alleged affair with Trump that surfaced mere months later.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the eve of the 2016 election, Daniels was reportedly paid $130,000 (£91,477) backed by a nondisclosure agreement by Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen to stay quiet about their alleged encounter, with Daniels agreeing to sign off on the arrangement out of fear for her personal safety and the safety of her family.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">
