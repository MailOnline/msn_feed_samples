CA integrity chief Iain Roy will meet with team performance manager Pat Howard and chief executive James Sutherland in South Africa on Tuesday to begin their formal review of Smith's earlier confession to orchestrating the cheating. Warner, along with Smith and Bancroft will be among the first players interviewed, with Smith and Warner in particular expected to be suspended for 'a stretch of time'. As the scandal deepens, a long-time teammate of both Smith and Warner said he believed the skipper wasn't to blame, and was trying to protect a younger player when he admitted to giving the green light to tamper with the ball. New South Wales star all-rounder Moises Henriques (bottom right with Smith and Nic Maddinson) said '10 minutes of panic' at the end of day's play led to the press conference which has left Smith's reputation in tatters.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Max Margan</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T10:23:02.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>David Warner named as 'chief conspirator' in ball-tampering scandal</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T10:23:02.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5547093/Darren-Lehmann-resigns-Australian-cricket-coach-Steve-Smith-scandal-ball-tampering-scandal.html" title="Australian cricket coach Darren Lehmann ¿set to RESIGN¿ in wake of ball-tampering scandal that shamed Australia"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5543353/Cricket-Australias-Tim-Paine-says-teammates-world-pain.html" title="'They're struggling¿ it's been a horrible 24 hours': Acting captain Tim Paine says his cheating teammates are in a world of pain ¿ but vows to 'make Australia proud' in next Test match "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5546575/The-Candyman-makes-fun-ball-tampering-disgrace-racy-shots.html" title="Cricket scandal reaches the Candy Shop Mansion!

In Melbourne, rain will spoil at least two days of the break, while Hobart will see blistering winds and storms. Making things worse is remaining warm temperatures, which will see humidity spike, especially in Darwin and Sydney. Brisbane will see rain for most of the long weekend, combined with temperatures in the high 20s. In Victoria's alps, the first snowfall of the season has begun to fall.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Hannah Moore</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T01:01:12.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>A cold, wet, Easter: Long weekend plans may be dampened by rain</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T01:01:12.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5539223/The-secret-truth-hot-cross-buns.html" title="The secret truth about hot cross buns: Your guide to getting the best Easter treat – and why you SHOULDN'T buy them from the supermarket"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5539223/The-secret-truth-hot-cross-buns.html" title="The secret truth about hot cross buns: Your guide to getting the best Easter treat ¿ and why you SHOULDN'T buy them from the supermarket"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5539231/Britain-braced-white-Easter-snow-way.html" title="Brace for a white Easter: Forecasters warn an arctic blast from Scandinavia could send temperatures plummeting over the holiday weekend with snow possible"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.bom.gov.au/australia/majorcities.shtml?ref=hdr" title="Major Cities Forecast plus Outlook"></link></item><item><title>Traveller pictures reveal what it was REALLY like to fly on board the Qantas non-stop 17-hour flight from Perth to London</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5543541/Traveller-pictures-reveal-REALLY-like-Qantas-non-stop-flight-Perth-London.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 05:45:56 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5543541</guid><description><![CDATA[Qantas made history for the first 17-hour non-stop flight from Perth to London.

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">'Refreshed and raring to go': Jonathan gives the direct flight the thumbs up in Perth</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our journey itself was almost ludicrously smooth - the seatbelt sign did not flicker on even once, with the only remotely rough patch of air experienced a few hundred miles north of the Maldives, before the Dreamliner tore away across the Indian Ocean.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were some nice touches with regards to the on-board service too: every passenger's plastic water bottle was refilled, never replaced, while all of the meals had been specifically designed by chef Neil Perry, in consultation with experts from The Charles Perkins Centre at Sydney University, to stave off jetlag.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back at London Heathrow's Terminal 3, our take off had been marked in style too, with actors dressed as kangaroos and surfers, and a giant of a man playing us aboard with an enormous didgeridoo. Even our boarding passes bore the legend 'Congratulations! You are boarding the first non-stop UK-AUS flight.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Travelling in this fashion is light years ahead of the original London-Australia flight - the infamous 'Kangaroo Route' - which began in 1947. That four-day intercontinental hopscotch – involving seven stops and costing the equivalent of more than £24,000 today - has now become a seamless, non-stop 17-hour zip Down Under. (It's significantly cheaper in real terms too, with tickets for this London-Perth route starting at just £793 per person return in economy).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new route, which will now fly daily, officially becomes the longest anywhere in the world from London (a massive 24 per cent longer than the previous record holder, from Heathrow to Jakarta) and the first ever direct air connection between the continents of Europe and Australasia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There's still room for improvement of course. No Wifi on the history-making QF10 is an issue – particularly as British Airways has introduced it to many of its own long-haul flights in recent weeks. And Qantas remains agonisingly short of Qatar Airway's current world record for the longest commercial flight on Earth: 9,028 miles between Doha and Auckland.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One gets the impression that record won't stand for too long, however. Qantas already have their eyes on a non-stop London to Sydney flight by 2022, with New York-Sydney potentially coming even earlier. For now, all eyes are on the historic achievement of QF10 but ultimately, success on the London-Perth service is just the beginning.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Jonathan Thompson was challenged by Huawei to take the upcoming Huawei P20 smartphone and test its features whilst onboard.

QF9 is operated by four pilots across the 17-hour journey, with one or two pilots resting at any one time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2. The flight will follow different flight paths depending on the best winds, helping the aircraft fly faster and more efficiently. Qantas analysed a decade of seasonal wind patterns in preparation for the new service.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">3. At 14,498km, QF9 is the third longest commercial flight currently in operation. It is the world's longest Dreamliner flight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">4. QF9 will carry around 92 tonnes or 110,000 litres of fuel with the Dreamliner burning approximately 20 per cent less than traditional aircraft its size.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">5. With a total seat count of 236 passengers, the Qantas Dreamliner has significantly fewer seats than many other airlines who have configured the same aircraft to carry more than 300 passengers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">6. Currently, most aircraft have cabin air pressure equivalent to that of an altitude of 8,000 ft. For the Dreamliner, Boeing cut that down to 6,000 ft, meaning its closer to conditions on the ground.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">7. Menus for the flights between Perth and London have been designed to maintain hydration, aid sleep and reducing jetlag and including poke bowls as well as home style comfort food.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">8.

In 1947 a return flight from Sydney to London cost £525 when the average wage was £7.

Fifteen years later Rach is unable to shake the memories from the night that she was raped.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Roger Byrom</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T03:55:50.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>How a young mother addicted to ice kicked the habit</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T03:55:50.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4434404/Heartbreaking-video-reveals-struggles-suicide-letters.html" title="Dear suicidal me...: Poignant video shows people reading out their own suicide notes to prove there IS a way back from utter despair"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4928440/Girl-29-adicted-self-harm-10-years-speaks-out.html" title="'There is a life beyond your scars': Woman, 29, who was addicted to self-harm for 10 years speaks out after it nearly claimed her life"></link></item><item><title>‘He’s gone rogue’: David Warner ‘drank Champagne with non-cricket mates as the ball tampering scandal erupted and removed himself from a WhatsApp group with the rest of the Australian team’</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5548305/David-Warner-drank-champagne-non-cricket-mates-ball-tampering-cheating-scandal-erupted.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 08:45:01 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5548305</guid><description><![CDATA[The actions of the disgraced ex vice-captain are causing a further stir within the team as other players allegedly ask for him to be removed from the team hotel, saying he has 'gone rogue'.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

The coaches weren't involved. It was purely the leadership group who came up with this.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>'We saw this game as such an important game. We've seen the ball reversing through this series and this ball didn't seem like it was going to go. It's such poor actions.

The US has announced the expulsion of 60 Russians, including including 12 intelligence officers from Russia's mission to UN headquarters in New York (pictured alongside Russia's French, Polish and German embassies). But Trump himself, who usually likes to tweet or hold a press event for major announcements, was silent. The Kremlin reacted in kind, threatening to 'respond to every country'. Russia's ambassador to the US said the move had 'ruined what is left of Russian-US ties,' threatening Washington by saying they will bear responsibility for the consequences. Peskov added the Foreign Ministry will analyze the situation and present a proposal to Putin (pictured inset) - who will make the ultimate decision on how to respond.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Timothy Sculthorpe</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T10:37:33.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>US and 22 other states expel Kremlin spies</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T10:37:33.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>European Union,Theresa May,Russia</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5545667/Social-media-spat-erupts-diplomat-expulsions.html" title="It’s Twitter war!

Australian vice-captain David Warner was involved in the decision to deliberately alter the condition of the ball in the third test against South Africa in order to gain an unfair advantage. His wife Candice hit back at comments made by former England captain Michael Vaughan criticising the Australian players for complaining about the personal abuse they received in the wake of the cheating confession. Fans have taken to Twitter to slam Warner for her response, claiming her cricketing husband deserves to be on the receiving end.

The nationwide demonstrations were sparked by the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on February 14 in which 17 people were killed. Hughes, 45, is a survivor of a mass shooting after jihadists opened fire inside the Bataclan theatre in Paris while he was on stage in 2015. The singer posted five times about the gun control protests, including once when he wrote student survivors were capitalizing on the deaths of their classmates by staging protest walkouts. Emma Gonzalez and David Hogg, both survivors of the Parkland school shooting, gave stirring speeches in Washington DC on Saturday as part of the protest.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Emily Crane</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T08:39:43.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Eagles of Death Metal singer slams March for Our Lives supporters</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T08:39:43.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5542535/Rick-Santorum-says-teens-learn-CPR-instead-protesting-passage-phony-gun-laws.html" title="Rick Santorum says teens should learn CPR instead of protesting for the passage of 'phony gun laws' "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5542391/Tiffany-Trump-likes-Instagram-photo-March-Lives-poster.html" title="Mutiny!

'Let the news cycle create another news cycle and it will be different information out there.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Mooch also suggested that even if the president had a decade-old extramarital liaison with an adult film actress, it's not such a big deal in 2018.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think there will be less fallout than people think because people have been anesthetized to these sort of scandals, it goes all the way back to President Clinton,' Scaramucci said. 'So to me, I think that, we'll talk about it, there will be another news cycle and then people will move on, that's my prediction.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over on Fox &amp; Friends Monday morning, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley wasn't even asked about it. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In his series of morning show interviews, Avenatti hinted things could get worse for the president. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 60 Minutes interview, for instance, could have been tawdrier. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'She was prepared to discuss intimate details relating to Mr. Trump,' the porn star's lawyer said. 'She can describe his genitalia. She can describe various conversations that they had that leave no doubt as to whether this woman is telling the truth.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And if she's not telling the truth, let the president take to the podium and call her a liar,' the lawyer continued.

Forget the story." And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, "That’s a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom." And then he was gone,' Daniels said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said, seven years later, she'd still be able to recognize him. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If he walked in this door right now, I would instantly know,' Daniels told Cooper. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avenatti charged Monday morning, 'It had to come from someone associated with Mr. Trump.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It didn't come from the magazine. That makes no sense. It was certainly not my client. There's only one other place that could have come from. And that threat was terrifying to my client,' the lawyer said.   </p><div class="mol-html" id="mol-a932c1e0-312f-11e8-8e03-9dd84b994011">                            <div><blockquote class="twitter-video" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On the heels of her bombshell interview, Stormy Daniels' attorney joins us in Times Square to discuss her claims <a href="https://t.co/j1x8wnwRN1">https://t.co/j1x8wnwRN1</a> <a href="https://t.co/aMk2vlGdrd">pic.twitter.com/aMk2vlGdrd</a></p>— Good Morning America (@GMA) <a href="https://twitter.com/GMA/status/978233226333364224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2018</a></blockquote></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels told 60 Minutes she didn't go to the police after the threat because she was scared.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More details about the $130,000 payment could come out too.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think when all is said and done, it will be clear that it did not come from [Cohen] or there was a promise of reimbursement,' Avenatti said, suggesting that President Trump was more heavily involved. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cohen has said that he made the payment using his own funds and acted independently from the then-presidential candidate.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Regardless, Mr. Cohen and the president have a significant problem related to this $130,000 and the agreement,' Avenatti charged. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels' lawyer also sounded confident that his client could get out of the non-disclosure agreement she signed and avoid a potential $20 million fine for speaking out.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Our position is that the NDA was never executed and it was never valid for a host of reasons and we're confident that a court is going to find that,' Avenatti said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said in the interview that she had one encounter of consensual sex with the future president.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He knows I'm telling the truth,' said Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She did not allege however that she was coerced into the encounter with the real estate scion, saying, 'This is not a "me too." I was not a victim.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> Daniels said her night with Trump began with him talking about himself and showing her an issue of a magazine with his picture on the cover. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Does this normally work for you?' Daniels said she told the then-reality TV star.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That threw Trump off guard she claimed, going on to explain: 'And I was like, "Someone should take that magazine and spank you with it."'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels then ordered Trump to drop his pants and 'gave him a couple swats' in playful manner she said to Cooper.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said they talked some more after that and that she became more comfortable when he stopped speaking about himself.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He was like, "Wow, you - you are special. You remind me of my daughter." You know - he was like, "You're smart and beautiful, and a woman to be reckoned with, and I like you. I like you,"' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pair had dinner in Trump's room she said and then had sex. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He didn't use a condom, she said, and she didn't ask him to. Afterward, he asked to see her again, she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels said that before they had sex Trump had broached the idea of her being a contestant on The Apprentice, and she likened it to a 'business opportunity.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the alleged tryst she said he called her several times and would ask if they could get together again and would claim that he had an update for her about the Apprentice. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said she felt that he was holding out the opportunity to keep her coming back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Of course. I mean, I'm not blind. But at the same time, maybe it'll work out, you know?' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In July 2007, a year after they had met, Daniels said Trump asked to meet with her privately at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. She said they did not have sex, but he wanted to. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels reported that Trump called her the following month to say he had not been able to get her a spot on his TV show. She said they never met again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When asked why she was deciding to speak now, Daniels said: 'Because it was very important to me to be able to defend myself.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said she was not all that bothered by what other people thought of her, but had a big issuer with being portrayed as someone who did not tell the truth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm not OK with being made out to be a liar, or people thinking that I did this for money and people are like, "Oh, you're an opportunist. You're taking advantage of this,"' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Yes, I'm getting more job offers now, but tell me one person who would turn down a job offer making more than they've been making, doing the same thing that they've always done?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cooper noted during the interview that Melania Trump had given birth just a few months before the alleged encounter between the two. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Did he mention his wife or child at all in this?' asked Cooper. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I asked. And he brushed it aside, said, "Oh yeah, yeah, you know, don't worry about that. We don't even, we have separate rooms and stuff,'' said Daniels. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just a few days prior, former Playboy model Karen McDougal told Cooper in a CNN interview that her affair with Trump began at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2006. McDougal said she ended the relationship in 2007 out of guilt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">McDougal has filed suit in Los Angeles seeking to invalidate a confidentiality agreement with American Media Inc., the company that owns the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer. It paid her $150,000 during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The lawsuit alleges that McDougal was paid for the rights to her story of an affair, but the story never ran. It also alleges that Cohen was secretly involved in her discussions with American Media.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump is also facing a New York defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Zervos has accused Trump of unwanted sexual contact in 2007 after she had appeared on the show with him, and sued after he dismissed the claims as made up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A judge ruled the lawsuit can move forward while the president is in office.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The White House hit out at porn star Stormy Daniels' claims that she had sex with President Trump and was threatened when she tried to take the affair public saying she had changed her story. 'With respect to that interview, the president strongly, clearly and has consistently denied these underlying claims and the only person who has been inconsistent is the one making the claims,' Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said during Monday's press briefing, speaking about the 60 Minutes interview that Daniels conducted with Anderson Cooper that aired Sunday night. Shah said he could only speak for the White House when it came to the $130,000 hush money payment paid by Trump's personal lawyer to Daniels in the waning weeks of the 2016 election, but he stated there was no wrongdoing on the administration's end. </dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Nikki Schwab</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T02:41:58.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Trump did NOT have sex with Stormy Daniels says White House</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T02:41:58.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Donald Trump,CNN</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content></item><item><title>Billionaire Elon Musk's father, 72, claims baby he had with his own step-daughter, 30, was the result of a 'one off mistake' when she split up with her boyfriend and turned to him for comfort </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5542057/Elon-Musks-father-claims-baby-step-daughter-result-one-mistake.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Mar 2018 17:49:52 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5542057</guid><description><![CDATA[The baby he fathered by his own step-daughter was as the result of a one-off ‘mistake’, Errol Musk – the South African father of the tech billionaire Elon Musk, has revealed.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

In the harrowing video, people react in panic and begin to flee when the roof appears to collapse and the inferno rages at the Kemerovo shopping centre. It comes as the MP for Siberian city - Anton Gorelkin, who is a member of the pro-Putin United Russia party - accused the city's deputy mayor of having 'his eyes closed by money' when the mall was opened in 2013. He added that the complex had been built from 's*** and sticks: Cheap plastic, a labyrinth of corridors and a hellish mess of ownership documents.' Four people have been detained, but officials have not yet confirmed the cause of the fire. Meanwhile, the country's anti-corruption Investigative Committee revealed that a security guard switched off the fire alarm at the mall when he was told a blaze at broken out. The  official death toll from the inferno is 64. Top right: Mourners outside the mall today.

The porn star also claims a mystery man threatened her and her infant daughter in 2011 after she tried to expose her 2006 tryst with the president in a magazine interview. She made the bombshell statements on 60 Minutes on Sunday night in her highly-anticipated interview with Anderson Cooper. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has dodged questions about her relationship with the president for months since the claims came to light. But the 39-year-old adult actress finally dished on her liaison with  The Donald, including the moment Trump said she was 'special' and that she reminded her of daughter Ivanka. Reports of their illicit fling came to light in January, when it was reported that Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 to sign a non-disclosure agreement just 11 days before the 2016 presidential election. She is now suing Trump over the hush agreement and claims it is void. The president's attorneys  claim Daniels is liable for more than $20 million in damages for violations of the agreement. However, Daniels said she wanted people to know 'the truth', even if she risks a $1million fine.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Julian Robinson</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T18:55:30.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>BREAKING NEWS -Stormy Daniels reveals she had sex with Trump</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T18:55:30.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Donald Trump,Breaking News</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5542085/Melania-Trump-stay-Florida-president-flies-solo-D-C.html" title="Melania Trump to spend Sunday evening away from her husband as he flies back to DC ahead of the hotly-anticipated Stormy Daniels interview just days after the pair posed at the White House in a show of unity"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5541837/Stormy-Daniels-opens-life-growing-up.html" title="The woman who became Stormy Daniels: How she once considered becoming a journalist and spends her spare time riding horses and caring for her 7-year-old daughter"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5541137/Stormy-Daniels-says-porn-career-helped-handle-public-scrutiny.html" title="Stormy Daniels says her porn career has helped her handle public scrutiny, just one day before her anticipated 60 Minutes interview about her alleged affair with Trump"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5540167/Stormy-Daniels-lawyer-Michael-Avenetti-goes-run-client-prepares-tell-interview.html" title="Stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenetti hits Central Park for a run as his client prepares for her tell-all 60 Minutes interview "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/978034568400863238" title="Maggie Haberman on Twitter: &quot;NEWS - Trump had dinner with Michael Cohen last night.

No good attorney would,' said Avenatti.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There's gonna be a lot of evidence  that will come to light in the coming weeks and months and we're confident that when all of the facts are laid bare for the American people they're gonna learn exactly what happened here.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This includes the identify of the individual who allegedly threatened Daniels back in 2011 and how she received her reported $130,000 payout after signing a non-disclosure agreement two weeks before the election.  </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avenatti said that while President Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen may have cut the check for $130,000, he is not the person who ultimately covered that sizable payout. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think when all is said and done, it will be clear that it did not come from [Cohen] or there was a promise of reimbursement,' stated Avenatti. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Regardless, Mr Cohen and the president have a significant problem related to this $130,000 and the agreement.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He addressed the individual who threatened his client seven years ago as well, soon after she detailed her alleged one-night stand with President Trump in an interview. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It had to have come from someone associated with Mr. Trump,' explained Avenatti. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It didn't come from the magazine. That makes no sense. It was certainly not my client. There's only one other place that could have come from. And that threat was terrifying to my client.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When asked if his client told anyone or went to the police after that threat, Avenatti responded: 'She was scared. No.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was then pointed out that this might make the story difficult to stand up, which Avenatti denied, saying: 'I don't think so. I think we're going to get to the bottom of this. The threat, the agreement, the bottom of the $130,000 payment.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels' lawyer also said at one point that President trump had never denied the affair, a claim which was met with immediate push back as it was pointed out there have been many denials. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Well actually, the president has never denied it. He's been silent. He can tweet on every other subject known the mankind. For some reason, he can't deny the affair,' said Avenatti. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He can't come out and deny the existence of the agreement and his knowledge of it. And can't deny the $130,000 payment. Why is that?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avenatti also addressed whether or not he was concerned about his client possibly losing everything, as she is now facing a $20 million lawsuit for speaking out. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Our position is that the NDA was never executed and it was never valid for a host of reasons and we're confident that a court is going to find that, he stated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We have a litany of more evidence in this case. And it's going to be disclosed. And it's going to be laid bare for the American public.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He then confirmed that this included direct evidence to prove an affair occurred between his client and President Trump. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avenatti ended things be responding to a question about why he chose to hold back during his client's big moment on Sunday night.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I don't think that was our biggest possible platform and we're gonna be smart and we want to be deliberate,' he explained. </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Similar tales: Daniels interview came just a few days after former Playmate Karen McDougal (above with Trump in 2006) made similar claims</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pair had dinner in Trump's room she said and then had sex. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He didn't use a condom, she said, and she didn't ask him to. Afterward, he asked to see her again, she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels said that before they had sex Trump had broached the idea of her being a contestant on The Apprentice, and she likened it to a 'business opportunity.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the alleged tryst she said he called her several times and would ask if they could get together again and would claim that he had an update for her about the Apprentice. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said she felt that he was holding out the opportunity to keep her coming back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Of course. I mean, I'm not blind. But at the same time, maybe it'll work out, you know?' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In July 2007, a year after they had met, Daniels said Trump asked to meet with her privately at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. She said they did not have sex, but he wanted to.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels reported that Trump called her the following month to say he had not been able to get her a spot on his TV show. She said they never met again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When asked why she was deciding to speak now, Daniels said: 'Because it was very important to me to be able to defend myself.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said she was not all that bothered by what other people thought of her, but had a big issuer with being portrayed as someone who did not tell the truth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm not OK with being made out to be a liar, or people thinking that I did this for money and people are like, "Oh, you're an opportunist. You're taking advantage of this,"' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Yes, I'm getting more job offers now, but tell me one person who would turn down a job offer making more than they've been making, doing the same thing that they've always done?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cooper noted during the interview that Melania Trump had given birth just a few months before the alleged encounter between the two. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Did he mention his wife or child at all in this?' asked Cooper. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I asked. And he brushed it aside, said, "Oh yeah, yeah, you know, don't worry about that. We don't even, we have separate rooms and stuff,'' said Daniels. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just a few days prior, former Playboy model Karen McDougal told Cooper in a CNN interview that her affair with Trump began at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2006. McDougal said she ended the relationship in 2007 out of guilt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">McDougal has filed suit in Los Angeles seeking to invalidate a confidentiality agreement with American Media Inc., the company that owns the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer. It paid her $150,000 during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The lawsuit alleges that McDougal was paid for the rights to her story of an affair, but the story never ran. It also alleges that Cohen was secretly involved in her discussions with American Media.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump is also facing a New York defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Zervos has accused Trump of unwanted sexual contact in 2007 after she had appeared on the show with him, and sued after he dismissed the claims as made up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A judge ruled the lawsuit can move forward while the president is in office. </p><mol-permabox id="mol-d33abc10-30f6-11e8-a2b6-ad61e6d08014"></mol-permabox><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Stormy Daniels revealed little new information about her alleged one-night stand with President Trump on 60 Minutes, but there was at least one question she was prepared to answer that never came up during the interview.

She can describe various conversations that they had that leave no doubt as to whether this woman is telling the truth.'

Many saw this as a vindictive act of class warfare by Labour minister of fuel and power, Manny Shinwell.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 8th Earl Fitzwilliam died in a plane crash in 1948 along with Marchioness of Hartington, the younger sister of John F Kennedy. He left no male heir.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the death of the 8th Earl the house began to decline. A sale of valuables at the time included 14 four-poster beds. It was later used as a teacher training college.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Fitzwilliam family ended its connection with the house in 1979, with the death of the 10th and last Earl. The house and 83 acres were sold to a private buyer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The sale did not include the deer park, the rest of the estate and the nearby Wentworth village, which were placed in a charitable trust. The estate, which features a range of listed follies including the 90ft high Rockingham Monument and 100ft high Hoober Stand, continues to be run by the Fitzwilliam Wentworth Amenity Trust.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 1999 architectural historian John Martin Robinson wrote that 'the failure of Wentworth Woodhouse to become a stately home open to the public after the Second World War and thus to have secured its future like Chatsworth or Woburn is an architectural tragedy'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The house was bought by architect Clifford Newbold in 1999 who hoped a huge legal claim against the Coal Authority for mining damage would help him restore the house. But this failed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The house was bought by the Wentworth Woodhouse Preservation Trust in 2017, partly funded by a £3.5 million grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As well as the vast mansion, the trust bought 83 acres of land immediately around it; the stable block, which is almost as large as the house; and a range of other buildings, including the huge, derelict Camelia House.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wentworth Woodhouse is regularly used as a film location - appearing as Buckingham Palace in the recent hit movie Darkest Hour and also in the BBC drama Victoria. </p></div>                        </div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>It is a year since the Wentworth Woodhouse (interior pictured bottom ), hidden in the South Yorkshire countryside just outside Rotherham, was bought by the Wentworth Woodhouse Preservation Trust for £7 million. This modest purchase price - the cost of a flat in parts of central London - is just the beginning of a mammoth investment needed by the trust as it works to reverse decades of decay. Trust chief executive Sarah McLeod believes that the total bill could be between £150 and £200 million. This is because the task she faces is epic. Wentworth Woodhouse's 606ft facade (pictured centre) is wider than Buckingham Palace - a building it stood in for during the filming of Oscar-nominated movie Darkest Hour - and its floor area is about the same as the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Alex Green</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T14:04:32.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Mansion with 600ft-wide facade set for £200M renovation</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T14:04:32.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5542143/Wayne-Coleen-Rooneys-luxurious-20m-custom-built-mansion-Cheshire-takes-shape.html" title="Wayne's OTHER manor: Rooney's monster £20MILLION home complete with football pitch, wine cellar and fishing lakes takes shape as he prepares to move his family in from £6m Cheshire pad"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5540149/British-state-school-troublemakers-attend-Indias-Eton-learn-hard-lessons.html" title="Unique TV experiment sends five British state school troublemakers to 'India's Eton' to learn some VERY hard lessons "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5541163/President-Trumps-older-sister-selling-eight-bedroom-beachfront-home-Florida-23M.html" title="Good deals run in the family!

Burgess was pulled from the pond by first responders and rushed to St. Vincent Indianapolis Hospital, but died from his injuries at about 11.30pm. His daughter was taken to Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health and remains in a critical but stable condition.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Phoebe Southworth</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T15:01:28.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Indianapolis father dies after jumping into pond to save his daughter</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T15:01:28.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5543715/Relationship-expert-reveals-couples-staying-longer.html" title="Forget the seven year itch!

<p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no more dangerous place in sport than the moral high ground. That's a lesson Australian cricketers have never learned.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One moment they're bragging to the world about their noble, hard-but-fair attitude to cricket and to life; the next they're whinging harder than any Pom ever whinged. Or else, like now, they're exposed as cheats.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A few months ago, Australian cricket team captain Steve Smith and one of the younger players, Cameron Bancroft, gave a giggling press conference designed to upset England in general and wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow in particular.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Australian cricket captain Steve Smith (right), 28, was forced into making a grovelling apology after TV cameras caught teammate Cameron Bancroft (left), 25, trying to alter the condition of the ball with a piece of tape covered in dirt</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">They were making a public issue of a jocular headbutt apparently offered by Bairstow as a daft greeting to Bancroft. The press conference was designed to make them look good – morally good – and their opponents bad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A head-butt sounds like assault, and the perception that Bairstow was a thug quickly began to sink in. Yet Bairstow insists – almost certainly truthfully – that it was nothing more than 'boys being boys' and their heads never made contact.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I knew I hadn't done anything wrong and, more importantly, the team and management knew that too,' said Bairstow. 'Australia, as they have admitted, were trying to use it to get under my skin.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was a typical Aussie tactic to undermine the opposition. All the more effective given that England's star player Ben Stokes had been charged with affray after an incident outside a nightclub and had not been allowed to join the tour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ball-tampering by Smith and Bancroft in the current Test against South Africa is another tactic, it now appears. It is a form of cheating designed to give their bowlers an unfair advantage, and regarded in the game as an extremely serious matter.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Australia's inconsistency in their sporting approach to cricket can be traced back to the famous Bodyline series of 1932-33 in Australia, in which England bowled fast balls at the body</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The series against South Africa was already quarrelsome, with Australia loudly and consistently claiming moral superiority.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Coach Darren Lehmann had claimed for instance that the spectators' abuse of vice-captain David Warner – who has now resigned along with Smith – was 'disgraceful'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the team were united in disgust at a remark they said was aimed by South African wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock at Warner. The words used were 'vile and disgusting and about my wife', Warner claimed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Again, this was par for the course – Australian cricketers boasting of their own virtue and innocence while whinging about the low morals of their opponents.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cricketers have always exchanged words on the pitch, but it took Australia to refine this as a tactic, known as sledging. Former Australian captain Steve Waugh called it the 'mental disintegration' of the opposition.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But as soon as South Africa decided to do it in this series, the Australians gave a squeal of horror. It's all right if we offer vile abuse to our opponents, they were saying, but it's morally wrong when it happens to us. They don't see a single inconsistency in that, however unsporting it is.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Talking of a lack of sportsmanship, let's not forget the moment in 1981 when New Zealand were playing Australia and needed a six off the last ball to draw the match.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Captain Greg Chappell instructed his brother Trevor to bowl the last ball underarm – making it impossible to hit a six.

England won the series 4-1 and Australians are whining about it to this day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fast forward to 1974-75, when the England team were beaten all ends up by the tactic of… fast bowling directed at the body. 'The sound of breaking Pommy skulls is music to my ears,' said bowler Jeff Thomson. England sent no telegrams.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">England have been involved in plenty of cricketing scandals themselves: let's make that quite clear. I'm not claiming the moral high ground for England: you only have to look at Australia to see what kind of mess that gets you into.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like many English people, I love Australia, as well as a few carefully selected Australians. But every now and then there comes a moment when our national attitudes to sport divide us, the great Australian sense of humour takes a pasting and sport acquires unnecessary layers of spite.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The answer is for us to hit back. As England great Ian Botham did when he received some hard words from the then Australian prime minister Paul Keating after he had walked out of an event in which the Queen had been mocked. 'I'm very proud of my heritage,' Botham responded. 'And unlike Mr Keating, I do have one.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Or AS Lord Harris, a 19th-century figure who played a huge role in English cricket, once said of Australia: 'They are capital winners out here, but I'm afraid that I cannot apply the same adjective to them as losers.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps the history of cricket in Australia is about what happens when you take sport too seriously. England's (and Britain's) long and frequently unedifying history of war and conquest means that we don't need sport to define our sense of nationality.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'As soon as you step over that line, it's war,' said Warner before the last series against England.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No, it's not, digger. It's a game and a bloody good one when played right. You and your team-mates should keep a sense of proportion… but I suppose it's too late for that now. </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

But the owners of Anna Sara Bridal in Newport, South Wales, avoided jail today despite falsely advertising the handmade bridal dresses for up to £1,000. Furious brides first found out they had been duped when they spotted 'made in China' labels on their dresses - and launched a campaign to get their cash back. But the Bishops quickly shut up shop, leaving more than 100 other brides worried they would be left without their white dresses on their big day. Both women avoided jail after pleading guilty to 18 counts of 'engaging in unfair commercial practice'.

The Met Office has warned temperatures will get 'increasingly colder' in the UK later this week, dropping as low as -5C (23F) overnight, while northern and central areas could have snow on Good Friday and Saturday.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Mark Duell</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T17:16:10.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Easter travel chaos fears amid 'Beast from the East Mark 3'</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T17:16:10.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>UK Weather,Met Office</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5542637/Christmas-turkeys-crackers-wreaths-sold-Easter-alternatives-UK-shops.html" title="We wish you a merry...EASTER: It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas as shops sell crackers, wreaths and turkeys "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5539231/Britain-braced-white-Easter-snow-way.html" title="Brace for a white Easter: Forecasters warn an arctic blast from Scandinavia could send temperatures plummeting over the holiday weekend with snow possible"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-5544015/Rail-workers-solidly-supporting-strike-dispute-guards.html" title="Rail workers `solidly supporting´ strike in dispute over guards"></link></item><item><title>How you can buy this three-bedroom brick veneer home for just $5,000 - but it comes with a catch</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5548127/How-buy-three-bedroom-brick-veneer-home-just-5-000-comes-catch.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 07:08:19 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5548127</guid><description><![CDATA[It might sound too good to be true but you can purchase this three-bedroom brick veneer house for a very affordable $5,000.

The inquiry in the disappearance of Mr McKeague (left) will be stood down and passed to a cold case team amid mounting costs and a lack of leads, it is reported. Mr McKeague was 23 when he was last seen walking through Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in September 2016 after a night out with friends. Police conducted two searches of a landfill site near Cambridge last year, with the first search lasting 20 weeks and the second concluding in December. Mr McKeague's father Martin (inset) said he fears the airman may have killed himself. Martin, 49, said he thought his son knew he was going to become a father (shown right, his son and girlfriend April, right) which may have affected his mental state.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>PA</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Wires</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T16:17:08.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Corrie McKeague probe shelved by police and passed to cold case team</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T16:17:08.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5543233/Paralysed-Manchester-Arena-attack-victim-regains-movement-legs.html" title="Father who was paralysed by Manchester bomb attack and told he would never walk again regains the feeling in his legs just HOURS after starting pioneering treatment"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5543061/Study-reveals-red-hot-names-1918-VANISHED-century-later.html" title="From Abe to Yolanda... study reveals the red-hot names of 1918 that have all but VANISHED a century later "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dad-missing-corrie-mckeague-suggests-12251623" title="Dad of missing Corrie McKeague suggests RAF gunner son may have killed himself - Mirror Online"></link></item><item><title>Social media slams Heineken for 'racist' commercial that sees a barman slide a low calorie beer past black people, into the hands of a fair-skinned woman who turns to talk to white men - then ends with the slogan 'sometimes, lighter is better'</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5545609/Chance-Rapper-calls-Heineken-ad-terribly-racist.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 15:24:14 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5545609</guid><description><![CDATA[The ad features a bartender sliding a bottle of Heineken to a woman looking sadly at her wine glass.

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">They're still in love: Eric Stewart of 10cc and his wife Gloria pose in 1970 </p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">After all, when they'd met — at one of his gigs at Halifax Town Hall in 1964 — he'd been poleaxed by the beautiful 16-year-old. ('I went gaga! Completely gaga!' he says today.)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, then, Eric thought again. Even better, he secretly wrote an ironic song explaining exactly how deeply he adored her, how desperately he pined for her when he was away, how he hung her picture on his wall and gazed at it — all without using those three little words.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric wanted to write a love song for his wife without saying 'I love you'. He wanted to show the conflict between feeling a certain way, yet avoiding those words.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The result, I'm Not In Love, was a massive hit in 1975, going to No 1 in charts all around the world; it earned endless royalties and inspired an entire generation of musicians.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Everyone over the age of 40 knows the lyrics 'I'm not in love, so don't forget it; it's just a silly phase I'm going through'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The song has been the soundtrack to countless romantic moments. It also made Eric and fellow Mancunian band members, Graham Gouldman (who co-wrote the song), Kevin Godley and Lol Creme, very rich. Even more important, it placated the lovely Gloria. Earlier this month, they celebrated their 52nd wedding anniversary with a big dinner for friends.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Eric Stewart and his wife Gloria are pictured celebrating a wedding anniversary in recent year</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We try to be romantic — we send each other cards and flowers and surprise each other. It's important to keep that side going,' says Gloria, who is still a vision, with blonde hair, pink cheeks and great legs. 'Even if sometimes someone needs a bit of a reminder . . .'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric is more prosaic. 'The fact it's lasted 52 years, especially in the music business is bloody astounding,' he says. 'Because you're tempted all the time!'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now 73, he looks more like a rather meek music teacher than a rock star who has worked with all the greats, from Paul McCartney to the Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder to James Brown.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As he offers me a flapjack, it's easy to forget that, in the halcyon days of the mid-Seventies, 10cc — christened in 1972 by record producer Jonathan King (later convicted of child sex abuse) who signed them to his label and then had a dream about a chart-topping band under that name — were the most popular group in the world for a time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That night he met Gloria in 1964, Eric, a 19-year-old self-taught guitarist, was well established on the music scene. His band, Wayne Fontana &amp; the Mindbenders, was riding the wave of their first major hit, and was a popular live attraction throughout the UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gloria, who'd grown up on a dairy farm in Haworth, West Yorkshire, was still at school, although modelling in her spare time. She'd gone along to the gig in Halifax with her friend, Pauline Matthews (now better known as the singer, Kiki Dee).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Apparently, Kiki quite fancied me!' says Eric, pink-faced at the notion. 'But when Gloria walked in I was dumbfounded. She was gorgeous, stunning. It was love at first sight!'</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img" style="height: auto;">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Gloria met Eric, a 19-year-old self-taught guitarist, when he was already well established on the music scene</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">He asked if she'd like to hop in the band's van to see a gig in Manchester with Eric Clapton later than night. 'Yeah. OK,' was Gloria's reply. And in an instant, her dreams of A-levels and art school flew out of the window.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ignoring her father's gruff 'I'll give it two years', she became wife to one of the biggest pop stars in the world at just 18. On their wedding day, March 10, 1966, the Mindbenders (without Wayne Fontana) were back at No 2 with A Groovy Kind Of Love.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gloria's father shouldn't have worried because Eric and his band members — the Mindbenders and 10cc (which grew out of trio called Hotlegs) — were never very rock 'n' roll.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They didn't smash up hotel rooms — 'I was more likely to fix a broken shower rail than break anything. I love mending things!'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And until The Beatles introduced him to Scotch and Coke ('a very dangerous drink'), even booze was thin on the ground.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There was no time,' he says. 'When we got back to our hotel at night the kitchen would be closed and we'd get up in the morning and straight onto a flight.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whatever, 10cc might not have been the coolest band in the world, but there were groupies. Did he and the others take advantage? 'We weren't that sort of band,' he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I ask Gloria if she ever worried he'd been tempted. 'Well, I've no idea whether he was, or not,' she says. 'But you have to trust and hope for the best. It wasn't easy.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the birth of their daughter, Dieta, she moved back in with her parents for a time, as Eric jetted around the world. 'I didn't see much of him for the first few years,' she says and agrees that the pressures would have broken many couples — but not them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I've never been looking for anyone else and I've never met anyone to make me want to leave Gloria,' says Eric. 'I've just always really, really loved her. Even if I didn't always say it in the early years.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I'm Not In Love put that right. Gloria knew nothing about it until the band invited the wives (her sister, Angie, is married to guitarist Lol Creme) to hear it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It sent shivers down the spine,' she says. 'It was very special.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even better, from that day on, Eric started telling Gloria he loved her again. 'Well, he had to then, didn't he?' she says archly.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">10cc went on to have five of their albums certified gold</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before I'm Not In Love, 10cc had had a string of hits and were the critics' darlings, but that song put them in the major league.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric played with the Stones and adores Keith Richards ('he's crazy now, but I still love him'), dislikes Jagger ('rude and a prima donna'), built a multi-million-pound house in Surrey and snapped up a slew of fast cars and a holiday house in Barbados, where they hung out with the McCartneys.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The couples were great friends, both living in East Sussex. Paul and Eric played together, and Linda and Gloria went horse-riding. Both battled breast cancer at the same time, but while Gloria survived, Linda, sadly, didn't.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric and Gloria were not big partygoers and never embraced drugs. Marijuana sent Eric to sleep and 'did nothing' for Gloria, other than give her 'a scratchy throat'. The closest they came to the hard stuff was in the late Seventies, when Eric and jet-lagged U.S. drummer Steve Gadd snorted cocaine every night for a week while recording.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When I played back what we'd done, it was awful! Never again,' says Eric. 'And never LSD — the Beatles tried it, John and Paul, and they really did suffer later.' Eric's most rock-starry splurge was his car collection — Bugattis, Jaguars, Alfa Romeos. 'I once got up to 174mph on an empty motorway in a Ferrari Boxer, with Gloria in the passenger seat!' he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gosh! What on earth did she say?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Slow down! And don't do it again. It was a thrill, but she was right.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But one night in 1979, she wasn't there to tell him off. Driving back from his studio, a little too relaxed after a couple of rum and Cokes, seatbelt undone, he hit a spot of black ice and crashed into a tree.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric fractured his skull, damaged his left eye and lost the hearing in his left ear. It took him a year to recover and, when he did, 10cc's time in the spotlight was fading.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It was a very difficult time,' says Gloria quietly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today, the cars are all gone. 'Now she tells me off for buying too many sweaters!' says Eric.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, all marriages are full of ups and downs and Eric and Gloria have had their share.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's been a rollercoaster and I'm not sure how we've managed to stay together all this time,' says Gloria. 'But we have. It can only be because we just love each other.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But also because they've worked at it, focusing on joint interests — doing up houses (here and in France), walking the dog, going out for dinner together at least once a week — and spending time with their two children (they had a son, Jody, in 1980) and their grandson, Christian.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Does Eric use the 'L' word now?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Oh yes! Every single night! 'Goodnight, I love you,' I say, just before we turn the lights out. And she always says, 'I love you' back.' </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>After nine years of marriage, one daughter and years of enforced separation caused by relentless touring with his band 10cc (inset), Eric Stewart’s wife Gloria (pictured left and right together) started complaining that he no longer told her he loved her.

She posted her injuries on Facebook in hopes the public could identify her attacker. The 23-year-old was with her friends for a bachelorette party when a Hispanic male grabbed one of the females in the party. Comparetto told him to leave them alone and he punched her in the face. Police have been unable to find the male because there is no surveillance footage showing the incident. The only footage of the man is a video from the pub showing that he was wearing a red shirt that night. Comparetto described him as 5'11'' in his late 20s or early 30s. Pictured left is her before the attack and right is her after.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Danielle Zoellner</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T06:48:34.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Woman posts photos of her injuries after a man punched her in the face</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T06:48:34.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5547219/Sheriff-Shooter-Maryland-high-school-killed-himself.html" title="REVEALED: Maryland high school gunman killed HIMSELF after he murdered his 17-year-old ex-girlfriend, injured another classmate and a cop shot him in the hand "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5546789/Photos-blood-soaked-nanny-stabbed-two-kids-death-tried-kill-herself.html" title="Gruesome crime scene photos show blood-soaked nanny collapsed on a bathroom floor after she stabbed two kids to death and attempted to kill herself"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.facebook.com/amanda.comparetto.1/posts/2126046037630160" title="Update Your Browser | Facebook"></link></item><item><title>Prince William's Private Secretary is replaced by top civil servant from Brexit department in latest move in 'Operation Handover' to pass Queen's duties to younger royals </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5544473/Prince-Williams-Private-Secretary-leave-Kensington-Palace.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 10:04:37 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5544473</guid><description><![CDATA[Prince William's Private Secretary Miguel Head is to leave the role in July after more than 10 years with the royal family.

In June, he was able to propose to his girlfriend of five years, Dani Willis, on top of the Empire State Building. But a shock admission of planning to cheat in the Third Test against South Africa on Saturday has put his growing fortune and luxurious lifestyle at risk. On Saturday, Smith admitted he and other members of the leadership team had asked rookie batsman Cameron Bancroft to tamper with the ball. The 28-year-old is now under investigation and faces a lifetime ban from cricket.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Hannah Moore</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T20:51:12.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>How Steve Smith's life could be torn apart by cheating scandal</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T20:51:12.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5543507/Disgraced-cricket-cheat-David-Warner-branded-hypocrite-calling-tampering.html" title="Eating your words, David?

They truly understood how to operate on foreign soil as, under the guise of being diplomats, they operated out of the Russian Embassy in Kensington Palace Gardens.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They would hardly ever try to recruit members of the British Parliament because they knew the risks of being caught were incredibly high. Most of the time they were here to advance their country’s technical or military progress by targeting our defence companies and tech firms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I grudgingly admired them, because despite them trying to undermine this country, they would do it in a way that was subtle. Stealing secrets with a feather, that’s how the Russians generally did it. No sledgehammers involved — unless it was a reprisal on one of their own defecting agents (as we now know only too well with the nerve-gas attack on double-agent Sergei Skripal).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back in 2012, I’d been on this particular job for weeks, one of a team keeping surveillance on a Russian — codenamed Dirty Boot — every time his S-Class Mercedes with diplomatic plates left the Embassy. Then our main attention switched to his new contact: a tall, blonde-haired woman in her early 20s he’d recruited and was priming to spy for him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was a receptionist at an office of executive suites at Farnborough in Hampshire, just a stone’s throw from the premises of a top-secret tech company that specialised in satellite imagery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was vulnerable and was tempted. She’d left university with massive debts and had tried to supplement her income by taking on dodgy escort work. He drew her into his clutches by offering her a way out. He also promised her a new identity, a paid-for home and a job with the ministry in Moscow if she helped him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On his instructions, she started up a passionate love affair with a particular engineer on the satellite project at the nearby tech company. He was flattered by her attentions, fell into her arms and their pillow talk produced information about his sensitive work on lasers and the means to hack into his emails, text messages and voicemail.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <div><div> <span></span> <div></div></div></div><p class="imageCaption">Stealing secrets with a feather, that’s how the Russians generally did it. No sledgehammers involved — unless it was a reprisal on one of their own defecting agents (as we now know only too well with the nerve-gas attack on double-agent Sergei Skripal)</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’d planted eavesdropping equipment in her flat and at the engineer’s house and knew that he was unwittingly revealing enough about the top-secret technology he was working on for the Russians to replicate it back in Moscow and advance their country’s technology research and development by at least 30 years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was in my car keeping watch at Farnborough airport for Hungry Worm, our codename for the blonde. I had to be careful because, though it was unlikely that her Russian handler had given her any anti-surveillance training, I couldn’t follow her directly out of the car park if she left the building.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was bound to be wary, given the furtive nature of what she was up to, and she might suspect something wasn’t quite right even if she wasn’t experienced enough to identify exactly what was wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Word came through on the radio. There’d been a tip that the Russian was planning a meeting with Hungry Worm, probably so she could hand over secret documents she’d managed to get her hands on from her boyfriend.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But no one on our side knew where it was to be. He’d apparently left the details of where and when at a florist’s shop. ‘We don’t have any further intelligence, just a heads-up that it’s going to take place.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She had obviously been told not to use her mobile phone to text him, hence we had no electronic intercepts to go on. Nor could we send an agent into the flower shop to see what the message was, just in case the florist was a Russian recruit, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But we desperately needed to monitor that meeting — and, if possible, photograph it — if we were to gather the proof to present to the Russian Embassy and kick this guy out of the country for trying to steal our technology. The problem was we had absolutely no idea where it was to be held.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I watched as a white courier van pulled up outside the executive suite where the blonde worked and a woman got out with flowers and took them inside to deliver. Van and driver then left. I saw the blonde leave the building and head off to a bus stop on the main road. There she got on a nearly empty number 82 bus.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We couldn’t send someone to follow her on board. That would be too much of a giveaway. Cars would tail the bus, but still risked being spotted, if not by her then by Russian counter-surveillance who might have been tracking her movements.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And what if she gave us the slip? We had to find out where she was going. I decided to act on my own initiative rather than await orders.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Though it risked compromising the whole operation if I was spotted, I walked into the reception area of the executive suite. A fresh bunch of flowers was on the front desk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trying to appear as if I was just waiting for someone, I strained to see the greeting card on the flowers. The message was upside-down but I managed to make out the words: ‘My beautiful lady, meet you same time at the Crescent.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I turned away, spun an impromptu yarn to a security guard who’d asked me my business and left the building. Back in my car, I phoned in to base to give them the message.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <div><div> <span></span> <div></div></div></div><p class="imageCaption">They would hardly ever try to recruit members of the British Parliament because they knew the risks of being caught were incredibly high</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was enough for the boys there to rapidly check this new information against the pair’s known meeting places. The word came back: ‘Meeting place between Dirty Boot and Hungry Worm is believed to be at the RHS [Royal Horticultural Society] garden in Wisley, specifically the glasshouse.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The radio net was now buzzing as everyone swung into action and reported in. ‘Hungry Worm is off the bus,’ said a message from the surveillance team covering the blonde. Apparently she was waiting by the side of the road.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then: ‘Stand by! Stand by! Dirty Boot is in a black taxi and pulling alongside her.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This could be a calamity. The danger was that the Russian was on to us and had been following us as we tracked her movements. Was he now warning her off?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But we need not have worried. The blonde got into the taxi with the Russian and together they sped off.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The whole team was directed to get to Wisley in Surrey as fast as possible, but without being seen. With Russian targets, you need to remain in the shadows or they will rumble you. We couldn’t follow the taxi directly or overtake it without the risk of blowing our cover.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Getting ahead of them meant a hair-raising drive at top speed through side-streets and back routes. Overtaking anything in our path at 140mph, we set off a speed camera, but things like that don’t bother us. Fines, parking tickets and London congestion charges get paid by the service.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And we made it. We got to Wisley ahead of the taxi and were in position with cameras to snap it when it arrived. Another of the team was already on foot inside the gardens, taking pictures of the plant life with a long lens.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was good cover. One woman in her late 40s apparently photographing flowers could get a crystal-clear image of both targets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I sat in my car outside and waited. Suddenly the radio sprang to life again. ‘Black cab heading towards Wisley entrance.’ Followed by: ‘Dirty Boot and Hungry Worm now out and walking arm in arm towards the main building.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nobody else went inside the gardens, which was wise. If we’d flooded the place with agents, they would have stuck out like a sore thumb.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We hid ourselves around the area, using cars and buildings for cover.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The controller kept us up to date with a running commentary on what was going on in the glasshouse. ‘Hungry Worm has shown Dirty Boot a brown paper folder. Dirty Boot looked at the contents but did not take anything out. The folder is still with Hungry Worm. She put it into her handbag.’ I had to admire this. By leaving the folder with the blonde, the Russian handler technically hadn’t stolen state secrets. He was making sure he and Russia kept their distance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Either this was because he’d spotted us or, more likely that he was instinctively providing himself with an extra layer of operational security. His plan was to receive the actual documents at a later date and was merely checking them. Bloody hell, these Russians are good.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And then in a flash the secret rendezvous in the gardens was over. The Russian headed towards the exit, where the taxi they’d come in was waiting in the car park. He got in and it drove off, with him staring rather suspiciously out of the back window.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The order came to let it go. We were not to follow. The blonde hadn’t moved and so nor did we. ‘We stay with Hungry Worm and the folder. We can’t risk a loss here.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was a lot at stake. Whatever intelligence about lasers the folder contained was clearly top priority. Losing it could be catastrophic. The United Kingdom relies heavily on being on the front foot in technologies like this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s partly a question of money. Our research and development on weapons is among the most advanced in the world. If another country steals it, it could cost us billions of pounds in earning power.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More importantly, though, we stand to lose our ability to defend ourselves. If certain codes and equipment were handed over to foreign intelligence, it could render our submarines and quick-reaction fast jets useless.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most people don’t realise it, but the biggest threat to our country isn’t terrorists living among us and causing the occasional atrocity, it’s the smooth-talking suit like the one who drove away in a taxi.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By now, the blonde was also on the move, walking to the car park where she, too, was met by a black cab. Everyone was on high alert as it drove her — and that precious file — away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It passed me and I let it move round a bend in the road before following discreetly. One of our motor bikes joined the surveillance from a side street, tucking in out of sight behind the taxi.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another team reported an alarming development. In his taxi, the Russian handler had doubled back and was now behind the blonde, presumably checking she wasn’t being followed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We needed to be on top of our game here. It was vital he didn’t see us, but if we gave him too much room he’d get away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And he didn’t spot us, though it was a close call at times as this strange, strung-out circus of taxis, souped-up cars and motorbikes with leather-clad riders made its way along the dual carriageway and in parallel B-roads through the quiet English countryside.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By now, the Russian had closed up on the blonde’s taxi and together they pulled into a petrol station. The updates crackled over the radio: ‘Both taxis at the fuel pumps. Dirty Boot and Hungry Worm are walking into the shop at the garage.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I knew it. This was going to be the handover of the folder.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just moments later they emerged from the shop and went towards their respective taxis. But which one now had the folder? We had to know because it was a safe bet that the two cabs would now split up and go in different directions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Who to follow if we wanted to safeguard the file? Would we have to guess?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Classic spy-craft came to our rescue. One of the most experienced members of our team, a 30-year veteran, had spotted the Russian’s shirt was hanging out at the back. It hadn’t been when he went into the shop. He must have tucked the file underneath and forgotten to tidy his clothing. It was time to stop him. He could soon be photographing the paperwork in the back of the taxi or sending it directly to a secure server before destroying the evidence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But we had to make the right call. At the time, there was much tension between London and Moscow. If we got this wrong and arrested a bona fide diplomat for no good reason, it would be extremely embarrassing for Downing Street.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We needed to check him out and the contents of the taxi, but do it in a way that gave us a sliver of deniability should it all go pear-shaped.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So Dirty Boot’s taxi was allowed to drive off while an elaborate ambush was being planned up ahead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not long afterwards, a regular police car with its blue lights flashing pulled the taxi over on the A325, ostensibly to conduct a licence check on the driver as part of a crackdown on rogue taxis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The uniformed officers — one of whom was Special Branch and in the know — had a dog with them, which could sniff out drugs. When it reacted positively, they had an excuse to impound the taxi and detain its occupants.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was a tactic designed to give the Government a plausible story to spin should a war of words break out after we kicked the Russian ‘diplomat’ out of the country.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It didn’t come to that. Instead there was a final blast over the radio from base as the operation reached its climax:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Dirty Boot is handcuffed, and one of the officers is now pulling sheets of paper from the back of his trousers. Hungry Worm and her driver have been arrested too.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’d got them. Done a great job and got the proof! And we could all go home now. Along with the rest of the team, I was on a high, knowing that Russia’s best weren’t good enough for us.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the upshot? The next morning, we were informed that Dirty Boot, the Russian spy masquerading as a diplomat, had already been escorted to the airport and told to leave the country.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hungry Worm, the blonde graduate he had turned with his promises of money and a new life in Moscow, was still in custody and more than likely wouldn’t go to jail, as she was providing information on the Russian and how he contacted her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for the poor engineer who’d been suckered into unwittingly disclosing secrets, he was left puzzling over the sudden disappearance of his new-found love.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was never actually told one of his files had been whisked from under his nose and nearly made it to Moscow. Instead, he got a warning from his boss to be more careful about his personal security in future and not let his head be turned by a pretty girl.
