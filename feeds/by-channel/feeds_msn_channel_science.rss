Even our boarding passes bore the legend 'Congratulations! You are boarding the first non-stop UK-AUS flight.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Travelling in this fashion is light years ahead of the original London-Australia flight - the infamous 'Kangaroo Route' - which began in 1947. That four-day intercontinental hopscotch – involving seven stops and costing the equivalent of more than £24,000 today - has now become a seamless, non-stop 17-hour zip Down Under. (It's significantly cheaper in real terms too, with tickets for this London-Perth route starting at just £793 per person return in economy).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new route, which will now fly daily, officially becomes the longest anywhere in the world from London (a massive 24 per cent longer than the previous record holder, from Heathrow to Jakarta) and the first ever direct air connection between the continents of Europe and Australasia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There's still room for improvement of course. No Wifi on the history-making QF10 is an issue – particularly as British Airways has introduced it to many of its own long-haul flights in recent weeks. And Qantas remains agonisingly short of Qatar Airway's current world record for the longest commercial flight on Earth: 9,028 miles between Doha and Auckland.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One gets the impression that record won't stand for too long, however. Qantas already have their eyes on a non-stop London to Sydney flight by 2022, with New York-Sydney potentially coming even earlier. For now, all eyes are on the historic achievement of QF10 but ultimately, success on the London-Perth service is just the beginning.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Jonathan Thompson was challenged by Huawei to take the upcoming Huawei P20 smartphone and test its features whilst onboard.

QF9 is operated by four pilots across the 17-hour journey, with one or two pilots resting at any one time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2. The flight will follow different flight paths depending on the best winds, helping the aircraft fly faster and more efficiently. Qantas analysed a decade of seasonal wind patterns in preparation for the new service.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">3. At 14,498km, QF9 is the third longest commercial flight currently in operation. It is the world's longest Dreamliner flight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">4. QF9 will carry around 92 tonnes or 110,000 litres of fuel with the Dreamliner burning approximately 20 per cent less than traditional aircraft its size.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">5. With a total seat count of 236 passengers, the Qantas Dreamliner has significantly fewer seats than many other airlines who have configured the same aircraft to carry more than 300 passengers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">6. Currently, most aircraft have cabin air pressure equivalent to that of an altitude of 8,000 ft. For the Dreamliner, Boeing cut that down to 6,000 ft, meaning its closer to conditions on the ground.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">7. Menus for the flights between Perth and London have been designed to maintain hydration, aid sleep and reducing jetlag and including poke bowls as well as home style comfort food.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">8. There are more than 21,000 individual items loaded onto the aircraft for each flight between Perth and London including 330 peppermint tea bags and hundreds of chocolate biscuits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">9. In 1947 a return flight from Sydney to London cost £525 when the average wage was £7. Today, the average Australian weekly wage is $1600 and a return fare from Perth to London can cost less than $1300.  </p></div>                        </div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Qantas made history for the first 17-hour non-stop flight from Perth to London.

Engineering works will hit major train routes across the UK including the west coast main line, London and East Anglia, while Northern, South Western Railway and the Docklands Light Railway could all be hit by strike action. Journeys on motorways could take up to 90 minutes longer on Maundy Thursday, with the M25 around the capital expected to be worst hit between 4pm and 6pm, while delays are also expected on the M1, M4, M5 and M6. The Met Office has warned temperatures will get 'increasingly colder' in the UK later this week, dropping as low as -5C (23F) overnight, while northern and central areas could have snow on Good Friday and Saturday.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Mark Duell</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T17:16:10.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Easter travel chaos fears amid 'Beast from the East Mark 3'</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T17:16:10.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>UK Weather,Met Office</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5542637/Christmas-turkeys-crackers-wreaths-sold-Easter-alternatives-UK-shops.html" title="We wish you a merry...EASTER: It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas as shops sell crackers, wreaths and turkeys "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5539231/Britain-braced-white-Easter-snow-way.html" title="Brace for a white Easter: Forecasters warn an arctic blast from Scandinavia could send temperatures plummeting over the holiday weekend with snow possible"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-5544015/Rail-workers-solidly-supporting-strike-dispute-guards.html" title="Rail workers `solidly supporting´ strike in dispute over guards"></link></item><item><title>She has a new beau!

The US has announced the expulsion of 60 Russians, including including 12 intelligence officers from Russia's mission to UN headquarters in New York (pictured alongside Russia's French, Polish and German embassies). But Trump himself, who usually likes to tweet or hold a press event for major announcements, was silent. The Kremlin reacted in kind, threatening to 'respond to every country'. Russia's ambassador to the US said the move had 'ruined what is left of Russian-US ties,' threatening Washington by saying they will bear responsibility for the consequences. Peskov added the Foreign Ministry will analyze the situation and present a proposal to Putin (pictured inset) - who will make the ultimate decision on how to respond.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Timothy Sculthorpe</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T10:37:33.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>US and 22 other states expel Kremlin spies</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T10:37:33.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>European Union,Theresa May,Russia</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5545667/Social-media-spat-erupts-diplomat-expulsions.html" title="It’s Twitter war!

The porn star also claims a mystery man threatened her and her infant daughter in 2011 after she tried to expose her 2006 tryst with the president in a magazine interview. She made the bombshell statements on 60 Minutes on Sunday night in her highly-anticipated interview with Anderson Cooper. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has dodged questions about her relationship with the president for months since the claims came to light. But the 39-year-old adult actress finally dished on her liaison with  The Donald, including the moment Trump said she was 'special' and that she reminded her of daughter Ivanka. Reports of their illicit fling came to light in January, when it was reported that Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 to sign a non-disclosure agreement just 11 days before the 2016 presidential election. She is now suing Trump over the hush agreement and claims it is void. The president's attorneys  claim Daniels is liable for more than $20 million in damages for violations of the agreement. However, Daniels said she wanted people to know 'the truth', even if she risks a $1million fine.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Julian Robinson</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T18:55:30.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>BREAKING NEWS -Stormy Daniels reveals she had sex with Trump</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T18:55:30.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Donald Trump,Breaking News</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5542085/Melania-Trump-stay-Florida-president-flies-solo-D-C.html" title="Melania Trump to spend Sunday evening away from her husband as he flies back to DC ahead of the hotly-anticipated Stormy Daniels interview just days after the pair posed at the White House in a show of unity"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5541837/Stormy-Daniels-opens-life-growing-up.html" title="The woman who became Stormy Daniels: How she once considered becoming a journalist and spends her spare time riding horses and caring for her 7-year-old daughter"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5541137/Stormy-Daniels-says-porn-career-helped-handle-public-scrutiny.html" title="Stormy Daniels says her porn career has helped her handle public scrutiny, just one day before her anticipated 60 Minutes interview about her alleged affair with Trump"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5540167/Stormy-Daniels-lawyer-Michael-Avenetti-goes-run-client-prepares-tell-interview.html" title="Stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenetti hits Central Park for a run as his client prepares for her tell-all 60 Minutes interview "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/978034568400863238" title="Maggie Haberman on Twitter: &quot;NEWS - Trump had dinner with Michael Cohen last night.

The Australian tour of South Africa has been marred by verbal abuse on and off the field, including several altercations involving David Warner, who has now been forced to quit as vice captain over ball tampering. South African fans have been also chanting about his wife Candice's tryst in a pub toilet with New Zealand rugby player Sonny Bill Williams, which took place before she was in a relationship with David. Some supporters even donned Sonny Bill masks at matches and Warner had an amazing off-field bust up with South Africa's Quinton de Kock after he allegedly brought up his wife's past.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Martin Robinson</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T21:21:21.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Aussie cricketer's partner slams ex-England captain Michael Vaughan</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T21:21:21.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>South Africa,England Cricket</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5544051/Sydney-regret-tattoos-spelling-love-cricket-Australian-ball-tampering-scandal.html" title="Tats awkward!

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Rescue workers help a woman after a shooting, outside the Bataclan theater in Paris on November 12, 2015</p></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Eagle of Death Metal singer Jesse Hughes, who survived the Bataclan mass concert shooting, has called March for Our Lives supporters 'pathetic' and said survivors of the Florida school massacre had insulted the memories of their slain classmates. In a series of now-deleted Instagram posts, Hughes took aim at those participating in Saturday's anti-gun protests across the US. The nationwide demonstrations were sparked by the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on February 14 in which 17 people were killed. Hughes, 45, is a survivor of a mass shooting after jihadists opened fire inside the Bataclan theatre in Paris while he was on stage in 2015. The singer posted five times about the gun control protests, including once when he wrote student survivors were capitalizing on the deaths of their classmates by staging protest walkouts. Emma Gonzalez and David Hogg, both survivors of the Parkland school shooting, gave stirring speeches in Washington DC on Saturday as part of the protest.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Emily Crane</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T08:39:43.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Eagles of Death Metal singer slams March for Our Lives supporters</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T08:39:43.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5542535/Rick-Santorum-says-teens-learn-CPR-instead-protesting-passage-phony-gun-laws.html" title="Rick Santorum says teens should learn CPR instead of protesting for the passage of 'phony gun laws' "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5542391/Tiffany-Trump-likes-Instagram-photo-March-Lives-poster.html" title="Mutiny!

No good attorney would,' said Avenatti.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There's gonna be a lot of evidence  that will come to light in the coming weeks and months and we're confident that when all of the facts are laid bare for the American people they're gonna learn exactly what happened here.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This includes the identify of the individual who allegedly threatened Daniels back in 2011 and how she received her reported $130,000 payout after signing a non-disclosure agreement two weeks before the election.  </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avenatti said that while President Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen may have cut the check for $130,000, he is not the person who ultimately covered that sizable payout. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think when all is said and done, it will be clear that it did not come from [Cohen] or there was a promise of reimbursement,' stated Avenatti. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Regardless, Mr Cohen and the president have a significant problem related to this $130,000 and the agreement.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He addressed the individual who threatened his client seven years ago as well, soon after she detailed her alleged one-night stand with President Trump in an interview. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It had to have come from someone associated with Mr. Trump,' explained Avenatti. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It didn't come from the magazine. That makes no sense. It was certainly not my client. There's only one other place that could have come from. And that threat was terrifying to my client.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When asked if his client told anyone or went to the police after that threat, Avenatti responded: 'She was scared. No.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was then pointed out that this might make the story difficult to stand up, which Avenatti denied, saying: 'I don't think so. I think we're going to get to the bottom of this. The threat, the agreement, the bottom of the $130,000 payment.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels' lawyer also said at one point that President trump had never denied the affair, a claim which was met with immediate push back as it was pointed out there have been many denials. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Well actually, the president has never denied it. He's been silent. He can tweet on every other subject known the mankind. For some reason, he can't deny the affair,' said Avenatti. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He can't come out and deny the existence of the agreement and his knowledge of it. And can't deny the $130,000 payment. Why is that?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avenatti also addressed whether or not he was concerned about his client possibly losing everything, as she is now facing a $20 million lawsuit for speaking out. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Our position is that the NDA was never executed and it was never valid for a host of reasons and we're confident that a court is going to find that, he stated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We have a litany of more evidence in this case. And it's going to be disclosed. And it's going to be laid bare for the American public.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He then confirmed that this included direct evidence to prove an affair occurred between his client and President Trump. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avenatti ended things be responding to a question about why he chose to hold back during his client's big moment on Sunday night.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I don't think that was our biggest possible platform and we're gonna be smart and we want to be deliberate,' he explained. </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

I mean, I'm not blind. But at the same time, maybe it'll work out, you know?' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In July 2007, a year after they had met, Daniels said Trump asked to meet with her privately at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles.

We don't even, we have separate rooms and stuff,'' said Daniels. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just a few days prior, former Playboy model Karen McDougal told Cooper in a CNN interview that her affair with Trump began at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2006. McDougal said she ended the relationship in 2007 out of guilt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">McDougal has filed suit in Los Angeles seeking to invalidate a confidentiality agreement with American Media Inc., the company that owns the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer.

In the harrowing video, people react in panic and begin to flee when the roof appears to collapse and the inferno rages at the Kemerovo shopping centre. It comes as the MP for Siberian city - Anton Gorelkin, who is a member of the pro-Putin United Russia party - accused the city's deputy mayor of having 'his eyes closed by money' when the mall was opened in 2013. He added that the complex had been built from 's*** and sticks: Cheap plastic, a labyrinth of corridors and a hellish mess of ownership documents.' Four people have been detained, but officials have not yet confirmed the cause of the fire. Meanwhile, the country's anti-corruption Investigative Committee revealed that a security guard switched off the fire alarm at the mall when he was told a blaze at broken out. The  official death toll from the inferno is 64. Top right: Mourners outside the mall today.

('I went gaga! Completely gaga!' he says today.)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, then, Eric thought again. Even better, he secretly wrote an ironic song explaining exactly how deeply he adored her, how desperately he pined for her when he was away, how he hung her picture on his wall and gazed at it — all without using those three little words.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric wanted to write a love song for his wife without saying 'I love you'. He wanted to show the conflict between feeling a certain way, yet avoiding those words.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The result, I'm Not In Love, was a massive hit in 1975, going to No 1 in charts all around the world; it earned endless royalties and inspired an entire generation of musicians.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Everyone over the age of 40 knows the lyrics 'I'm not in love, so don't forget it; it's just a silly phase I'm going through'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The song has been the soundtrack to countless romantic moments. It also made Eric and fellow Mancunian band members, Graham Gouldman (who co-wrote the song), Kevin Godley and Lol Creme, very rich. Even more important, it placated the lovely Gloria.

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Eric Stewart and his wife Gloria are pictured celebrating a wedding anniversary in recent year</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We try to be romantic — we send each other cards and flowers and surprise each other. It's important to keep that side going,' says Gloria, who is still a vision, with blonde hair, pink cheeks and great legs. 'Even if sometimes someone needs a bit of a reminder . . .'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric is more prosaic. 'The fact it's lasted 52 years, especially in the music business is bloody astounding,' he says. 'Because you're tempted all the time!'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now 73, he looks more like a rather meek music teacher than a rock star who has worked with all the greats, from Paul McCartney to the Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder to James Brown.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As he offers me a flapjack, it's easy to forget that, in the halcyon days of the mid-Seventies, 10cc — christened in 1972 by record producer Jonathan King (later convicted of child sex abuse) who signed them to his label and then had a dream about a chart-topping band under that name — were the most popular group in the world for a time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That night he met Gloria in 1964, Eric, a 19-year-old self-taught guitarist, was well established on the music scene. His band, Wayne Fontana &amp; the Mindbenders, was riding the wave of their first major hit, and was a popular live attraction throughout the UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gloria, who'd grown up on a dairy farm in Haworth, West Yorkshire, was still at school, although modelling in her spare time. She'd gone along to the gig in Halifax with her friend, Pauline Matthews (now better known as the singer, Kiki Dee).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Apparently, Kiki quite fancied me!' says Eric, pink-faced at the notion.

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Gloria met Eric, a 19-year-old self-taught guitarist, when he was already well established on the music scene</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">He asked if she'd like to hop in the band's van to see a gig in Manchester with Eric Clapton later than night. 'Yeah. OK,' was Gloria's reply. And in an instant, her dreams of A-levels and art school flew out of the window.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ignoring her father's gruff 'I'll give it two years', she became wife to one of the biggest pop stars in the world at just 18. On their wedding day, March 10, 1966, the Mindbenders (without Wayne Fontana) were back at No 2 with A Groovy Kind Of Love.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gloria's father shouldn't have worried because Eric and his band members — the Mindbenders and 10cc (which grew out of trio called Hotlegs) — were never very rock 'n' roll.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They didn't smash up hotel rooms — 'I was more likely to fix a broken shower rail than break anything. I love mending things!'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And until The Beatles introduced him to Scotch and Coke ('a very dangerous drink'), even booze was thin on the ground.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There was no time,' he says. 'When we got back to our hotel at night the kitchen would be closed and we'd get up in the morning and straight onto a flight.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whatever, 10cc might not have been the coolest band in the world, but there were groupies. Did he and the others take advantage? 'We weren't that sort of band,' he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I ask Gloria if she ever worried he'd been tempted. 'Well, I've no idea whether he was, or not,' she says. 'But you have to trust and hope for the best. It wasn't easy.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the birth of their daughter, Dieta, she moved back in with her parents for a time, as Eric jetted around the world. 'I didn't see much of him for the first few years,' she says and agrees that the pressures would have broken many couples — but not them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I've never been looking for anyone else and I've never met anyone to make me want to leave Gloria,' says Eric. 'I've just always really, really loved her. Even if I didn't always say it in the early years.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I'm Not In Love put that right. Gloria knew nothing about it until the band invited the wives (her sister, Angie, is married to guitarist Lol Creme) to hear it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It sent shivers down the spine,' she says. 'It was very special.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even better, from that day on, Eric started telling Gloria he loved her again.

The closest they came to the hard stuff was in the late Seventies, when Eric and jet-lagged U.S. drummer Steve Gadd snorted cocaine every night for a week while recording.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When I played back what we'd done, it was awful! Never again,' says Eric. 'And never LSD — the Beatles tried it, John and Paul, and they really did suffer later.' Eric's most rock-starry splurge was his car collection — Bugattis, Jaguars, Alfa Romeos. 'I once got up to 174mph on an empty motorway in a Ferrari Boxer, with Gloria in the passenger seat!' he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gosh! What on earth did she say?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Slow down! And don't do it again. It was a thrill, but she was right.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But one night in 1979, she wasn't there to tell him off. Driving back from his studio, a little too relaxed after a couple of rum and Cokes, seatbelt undone, he hit a spot of black ice and crashed into a tree.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric fractured his skull, damaged his left eye and lost the hearing in his left ear. It took him a year to recover and, when he did, 10cc's time in the spotlight was fading.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It was a very difficult time,' says Gloria quietly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today, the cars are all gone. 'Now she tells me off for buying too many sweaters!' says Eric.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, all marriages are full of ups and downs and Eric and Gloria have had their share.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's been a rollercoaster and I'm not sure how we've managed to stay together all this time,' says Gloria. 'But we have. It can only be because we just love each other.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But also because they've worked at it, focusing on joint interests — doing up houses (here and in France), walking the dog, going out for dinner together at least once a week — and spending time with their two children (they had a son, Jody, in 1980) and their grandson, Christian.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Does Eric use the 'L' word now?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Oh yes! Every single night! 'Goodnight, I love you,' I say, just before we turn the lights out. And she always says, 'I love you' back.' </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>After nine years of marriage, one daughter and years of enforced separation caused by relentless touring with his band 10cc (inset), Eric Stewart’s wife Gloria (pictured left and right together) started complaining that he no longer told her he loved her. Her grumbling fell on deaf ears. ‘If I said it all the time, it would lose its meaning,’ he would protest. Which, to Gloria, felt a little thin. But, then, Eric thought again. Even better, he secretly wrote an ironic song explaining exactly how deeply he adored her, how desperately he pined for her when he was away, how he hung her picture on his wall and gazed at it — all without using those three little words.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Alex Green</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T13:54:19.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>The wife’s grumble that made her husband write 10cc’s I’m Not In Love</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T13:54:19.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5540585/Reunited-Spice-Girls-stars-plan-animated-adventure-starring-characters-voiced-band.html" title="Spice Girls wannabe superheroes: Reunited pop stars plan an animated adventure starring characters based on and voiced by the band members"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5535671/Children-left-swinging-20-MINUTES-ride-hit-power-failure.html" title="'We thought they were going to fall off and die': Terrified parents watch as their children are left swinging mid-air for 20 MINUTES when fun-fair ride is hit by a power failure in Bristol "></link></item><item><title>Peter Andre as you've never seen him before!

Warner, along with Smith and Bancroft will be among the first players interviewed, with Smith and Warner in particular expected to be suspended for 'a stretch of time'. As the scandal deepens, a long-time teammate of both Smith and Warner said he believed the skipper wasn't to blame, and was trying to protect a younger player when he admitted to giving the green light to tamper with the ball.

Trump said.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The president has consistently used a spokesman to deny claims made by Daniels. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the original story on the hush money payment, published January 12 by the Wall Street Journal, a White House official said Trump's denial was already a done deal. </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

He's been silent. He can tweet on every other subject known to mankind. For some reason, he can' deny the affair,' Avenatti said.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He can't come out and deny the existence of the agreement and his knowledge of it. And can't deny the $130,000 payment. Why is that?' Daniels' lawyer also challenged. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When reporters asked Trump about the interview as he was traveling back to Washington, D.C., Sunday night he ignored their questions.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump is being told to keep his mouth closed, as advisers think it's not a good look for a president to be in a public he-said, she-said with a porn star, according to <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/rebeccaballhaus/status/978348236019822593">reporting from the Wall Street Journal</a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On CNN Monday, former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci expressed just that.<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/cnn/index.html"> </a></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Well, listen, I haven't talked to him about this specific strategy here, but I think the best thing to do here, and if I was offering any advice: Let it go, at this point, and move on,' Scaramucci said. 'Let the news cycle create another news cycle and it will be different information out there.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Mooch also suggested that even if the president had a decade-old extramarital liaison with an adult film actress, it's not such a big deal in 2018.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think there will be less fallout than people think because people have been anesthetized to these sort of scandals, it goes all the way back to President Clinton,' Scaramucci said. 'So to me, I think that, we'll talk about it, there will be another news cycle and then people will move on, that's my prediction.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over on Fox &amp; Friends Monday morning, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley wasn't even asked about it. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In his series of morning show interviews, Avenatti hinted things could get worse for the president. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 60 Minutes interview, for instance, could have been tawdrier. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'She was prepared to discuss intimate details relating to Mr. Trump,' the porn star's lawyer said. 'She can describe his genitalia. She can describe various conversations that they had that leave no doubt as to whether this woman is telling the truth.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And if she's not telling the truth, let the president take to the podium and call her a liar,' the lawyer continued. 'Let the president come forward and say it never happened.'    </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While Shah used a lack of evidence to make his case from the White House podium, Avenatti had already indicated on Good Morning America that there could be some coming down the pipeline.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We're in the very early stages of this case, and we're not gonna play all of our cards at this juncture. No good attorney would,' said Avenatti.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There's gonna be a lot of evidence  that will come to light in the coming weeks and months and we're confident that when all of the facts are laid bare for the American people they're gonna learn exactly what happened here,' the lawyer said. </p><div class="mol-img-group floatRHS" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

Forget the story." And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, "That’s a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom." And then he was gone,' Daniels said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said, seven years later, she'd still be able to recognize him. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If he walked in this door right now, I would instantly know,' Daniels told Cooper. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avenatti charged Monday morning, 'It had to come from someone associated with Mr. Trump.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It didn't come from the magazine. That makes no sense. It was certainly not my client. There's only one other place that could have come from. And that threat was terrifying to my client,' the lawyer said.   </p><div class="mol-html" id="mol-a932c1e0-312f-11e8-8e03-9dd84b994011">                            <div><blockquote class="twitter-video" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On the heels of her bombshell interview, Stormy Daniels' attorney joins us in Times Square to discuss her claims <a href="https://t.co/j1x8wnwRN1">https://t.co/j1x8wnwRN1</a> <a href="https://t.co/aMk2vlGdrd">pic.twitter.com/aMk2vlGdrd</a></p>— Good Morning America (@GMA) <a href="https://twitter.com/GMA/status/978233226333364224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2018</a></blockquote></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels told 60 Minutes she didn't go to the police after the threat because she was scared.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More details about the $130,000 payment could come out too.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think when all is said and done, it will be clear that it did not come from [Cohen] or there was a promise of reimbursement,' Avenatti said, suggesting that President Trump was more heavily involved. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cohen has said that he made the payment using his own funds and acted independently from the then-presidential candidate.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Regardless, Mr. Cohen and the president have a significant problem related to this $130,000 and the agreement,' Avenatti charged. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels' lawyer also sounded confident that his client could get out of the non-disclosure agreement she signed and avoid a potential $20 million fine for speaking out.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Our position is that the NDA was never executed and it was never valid for a host of reasons and we're confident that a court is going to find that,' Avenatti said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said in the interview that she had one encounter of consensual sex with the future president.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He knows I'm telling the truth,' said Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She did not allege however that she was coerced into the encounter with the real estate scion, saying, 'This is not a "me too." I was not a victim.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> Daniels said her night with Trump began with him talking about himself and showing her an issue of a magazine with his picture on the cover. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Does this normally work for you?' Daniels said she told the then-reality TV star.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That threw Trump off guard she claimed, going on to explain: 'And I was like, "Someone should take that magazine and spank you with it."'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels then ordered Trump to drop his pants and 'gave him a couple swats' in playful manner she said to Cooper.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said they talked some more after that and that she became more comfortable when he stopped speaking about himself.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He was like, "Wow, you - you are special. You remind me of my daughter." You know - he was like, "You're smart and beautiful, and a woman to be reckoned with, and I like you. I like you,"' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pair had dinner in Trump's room she said and then had sex. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He didn't use a condom, she said, and she didn't ask him to. Afterward, he asked to see her again, she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels said that before they had sex Trump had broached the idea of her being a contestant on The Apprentice, and she likened it to a 'business opportunity.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the alleged tryst she said he called her several times and would ask if they could get together again and would claim that he had an update for her about the Apprentice. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said she felt that he was holding out the opportunity to keep her coming back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Of course. I mean, I'm not blind. But at the same time, maybe it'll work out, you know?' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In July 2007, a year after they had met, Daniels said Trump asked to meet with her privately at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. She said they did not have sex, but he wanted to. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels reported that Trump called her the following month to say he had not been able to get her a spot on his TV show. She said they never met again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When asked why she was deciding to speak now, Daniels said: 'Because it was very important to me to be able to defend myself.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said she was not all that bothered by what other people thought of her, but had a big issuer with being portrayed as someone who did not tell the truth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm not OK with being made out to be a liar, or people thinking that I did this for money and people are like, "Oh, you're an opportunist. You're taking advantage of this,"' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Yes, I'm getting more job offers now, but tell me one person who would turn down a job offer making more than they've been making, doing the same thing that they've always done?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cooper noted during the interview that Melania Trump had given birth just a few months before the alleged encounter between the two. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Did he mention his wife or child at all in this?' asked Cooper. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I asked. And he brushed it aside, said, "Oh yeah, yeah, you know, don't worry about that. We don't even, we have separate rooms and stuff,'' said Daniels. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just a few days prior, former Playboy model Karen McDougal told Cooper in a CNN interview that her affair with Trump began at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2006. McDougal said she ended the relationship in 2007 out of guilt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">McDougal has filed suit in Los Angeles seeking to invalidate a confidentiality agreement with American Media Inc., the company that owns the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer. It paid her $150,000 during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The lawsuit alleges that McDougal was paid for the rights to her story of an affair, but the story never ran. It also alleges that Cohen was secretly involved in her discussions with American Media.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump is also facing a New York defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Zervos has accused Trump of unwanted sexual contact in 2007 after she had appeared on the show with him, and sued after he dismissed the claims as made up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A judge ruled the lawsuit can move forward while the president is in office.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The White House hit out at porn star Stormy Daniels' claims that she had sex with President Trump and was threatened when she tried to take the affair public saying she had changed her story. 'With respect to that interview, the president strongly, clearly and has consistently denied these underlying claims and the only person who has been inconsistent is the one making the claims,' Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said during Monday's press briefing, speaking about the 60 Minutes interview that Daniels conducted with Anderson Cooper that aired Sunday night. Shah said he could only speak for the White House when it came to the $130,000 hush money payment paid by Trump's personal lawyer to Daniels in the waning weeks of the 2016 election, but he stated there was no wrongdoing on the administration's end. </dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Nikki Schwab</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T02:41:58.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Trump did NOT have sex with Stormy Daniels says White House</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T02:41:58.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Donald Trump,CNN</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content></item><item><title>Father, 51, and his son, 14, are killed after getting trapped inside a grain silo on their family farm</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5543775/Father-51-son-14-die-trapped-silo.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 06:00:06 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5543775</guid><description><![CDATA[Daniel Briel (right), 51 and his 14-year-old son, David Briel (left) were both killed while working in a silo on their family farm when they became trapped inside.

The Barron County Sheriff Department said they received a 911 call shortly before 8pm on Saturday stating that two males were trapped in the silo (inset). They identified the victims as Daniel Briel (right), 51 and his 14-year-old son, David Briel (left). David's brother, Caleb, 15, was also working them, but he managed to escape and call 911. Authorities said the boys and their father were working inside the silo when there was an 'internal collapse of silage'. Life saving efforts were attempted, but Daniel was pronounced dead at the scene. Daniel had a weak pulse, and died before he arrived to a local hospital. According to the family, David had just turned 14 years old six days before the tragedy. Dan's wife and David's mom, Melissa, was in Washington visiting her oldest son, Ben at the time. Daniel and Melissa also have a daughter, Abigail and their granddaughter Erika.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Valerie Edwards</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T02:55:09.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Father, 51, and his son, 14, die after becoming trapped in a silo</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T02:55:09.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5543323/Man-44-shoots-dead-wife-sister-couples-three-children.html" title="Man, 44, shoots dead his wife and her sister in front of the couple's three children before turning the gun on himself outside their Florida home"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5543057/Firefighters-line-streets-wake-colleague-killed-set-Edward-Nortons-film.html" title="Firefighters line the streets for the wake of colleague who was killed tackling a blaze on the set of Edward Norton's film"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.gofundme.com/dan-amp-david-briel-funeral-fund" title="www.gofundme.com..."></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.fox9.com/news/father-son-killed-after-silo-collapses-near-barron-wis" title="Father, son killed in silage collapse near Barron, Wis. - Story | KMSP"></link></item><item><title>Busty Iskra Lawrence showcases her incredible curves and perky posterior in emerald green bikini during Miami breakaway</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5546111/Busty-Iskra-Lawrence-showcases-incredible-curves-Miami.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 17:02:42 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5546111</guid><description><![CDATA[The striking British model highlighted her enviable curves in the skimpy two-piece as she luxuriated by her abode's dock.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="moduleFull"></div>

The changes will make the HM Passport Office an extra £50 million in 2018 to 2019.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ed Riley</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T15:00:42.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>UK passports are to increase in price from TOMORROW</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T15:00:42.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5543167/118-000-join-passport-battle-STOP-British-passports-abroad.html" title="118,000 join passport battle: Mail readers pile the pressure on MPs to STOP British passports being made abroad"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5537713/Mail-petition-contract-UKs-new-blue-passport-British-firm.html" title="Mail's petition to give the contract for the UK's new blue passport to a British firm tops 100,000 signatures"></link></item><item><title>PICTURED: Four-year-old boy is attacked and 'shaken to death' by his family dog while playing in his backyard in Texas</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5544295/Four-year-old-boy-attacked-shaken-death-family-dog.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 10:15:32 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5544295</guid><description><![CDATA[The 'mixed large breed' was tied up, but it seems the boy got too close to it and relatives looked out of the window to see the animal's mouth clamped over the boy's neck in Texas.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p class="mol-para-with-font">It sounds like a joke now, but until recently David Warner — the most disliked player in the world's most disliked team — was known to team-mates as 'the Reverend'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But those outside Australia's dressing-room bubble have not always regarded him as a natural man of the cloth. And, as his role in the ball-tampering scandal that has engulfed Australian cricket comes under increasing scrutiny, the nickname may have to be quietly shelved.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As wicketkeeping great Adam Gilchrist remarked after Warner's stairwell spat with <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/south_africa/index.html" id="mol-22255c40-313d-11e8-b4c6-7b519903e7e3">South Africa</a>'s Quinton de Kock at Durban: 'The Reverend's gone — Bull's back.' </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">It sounds like a joke now, but David Warner was once known to team-mates as 'the Reverend'</p></div><div>



</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">For a while, Warner managed to convince even himself that his 'Bull' persona — the bundle of venom who regarded no sledge as too contemptible — was a thing of the past.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After marrying Candice Falzon, a former professional ironwoman, in 2015 and becoming a father, he seemed to mellow. He stopped drinking, and his wife introduced him to John Novak, a mind coach. In turn, Novak introduced Warner to mindfulness — the western world's adaptation of Buddhism's search for inner calm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It appeared to do the trick. Warner would deal with stick by telling himself three positive things about his critic. He adopted preacher-like poses to celebrate his centuries. In 2016, he was named Australia's Sporting Father of the Year. He scored runs for fun, especially in one-day cricket.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I don't know where they've taken the old Davey Warner,' said a team-mate.

</div>    </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Worse, the Bull has since had other ideas. <span class="mol-style-italic">Sportsmail </span>revealed on Monday that Warner told England players at an end-of-series drinks party how he had used a bandage on his hand to rough up the ball during the Ashes and help Australia's bowlers achieve reverse swing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And Cricket Australia's investigation into the events that led to opening batsman Cameron Bancroft shoving an incriminating piece of sticky tape down his trousers in Cape Town, and captain Steve Smith admitting to cheating, is sure to focus on Warner's role in the fiasco. A ban seems inevitable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet the signs were already there that the Reverend's halo had begun to slip. Ahead of the Ashes, Warner went full Bull, saying: 'As soon as you step on that line it's war. You try and get into a battle as quick as you can.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Experience</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The two men are at relatively similar stages of their respective careers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Parker, a world champion with 24 fights and 24 wins, 18 of those by knockout. Joshua, a world champion with 20 fights and 20 wins, all coming by knockout. But when it comes to a comparison there is one name that sets the two fighters apart.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Joshua’s stunning victory over Wladimir Klitschko was seen as a passing of the torch moment for a division that the Ukrainian dominated for over 10 years. Parker has more rounds under his belt but has never beaten someone on the level of Klitschko nor fought on a stage like this one. When it comes to the one man both have faced, Carlos Takam, neither shone but Joshua secured a stoppage while Parker was taken all the way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Parker is still waiting for his breakout fight, Joshua has had his. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Joshua: 7.5/10 </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Parker: 6.5/10 </strong></p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Joshua earned his stripes when he knocked out Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley in 2017</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Power</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anyone can knockout anyone in heavyweight boxing, let's get that straight. Parker has 18 KOs to his name so there's no doubt he has power in his hands but what can’t be ignored is the fact the Kiwi has failed to finish any of his three fights since stepping up to world level. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Taken the distance by Hughie Fury, Razvan Cojanu, Ruiz and Takam not long before that, Parker's power is nothing special at the top end of the division. The same can't be said for his big-punching adversary, who has toppled all 20 of his opponents since turning pro. Joshua maintained that record with his controversial 10th-round stoppage of Takam in October and while he does not possess the one-punch knockout power of Deontay Wilder, there is only so many clean shots anyone standing across the ring from the Brit can handle. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Joshua: ‪9/10 </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Parker: ‪7/10 </strong></p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

The 25-year-old has proven that he can take a punch as good as anyone. The New Zealander has never been dropped and never even been wobbled despite being caught flush on a number of occasions. Joshua, meanwhile, has long been linked with a suspect chin with tales of his sparring troubles having circulated the boxing world for years. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniel Dubois and fellow British Olympian David Price have both knocked down the Brit in the gym. The 28-year-old was also rocked badly by British rival Dillian Whyte in the second round of their grudge match and sent to the canvas when Klitschko landed a straight right hand during their clash at Wembley. Whether Parker has the power to capitalise is another question. </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

The WBO champion’s defence is leaky and his lack of head movement sees him get caught regularly whenever the opponent applies real pressure. In his last outing against Fury, one many argue he lost, the 26-year-old ate plenty of shots while Takam was also able to land numerous times when they met. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Joshua, who fights in a more cautious style, has good defensive awareness with his right hand up protecting his chin while also using his lead hand to parry his opponent’s jab and measure distance. The Englishman is liable to getting dragged into a war, however, and when he does he leaves himself open to sharp counters that Parker could take advantage of. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Joshua: 8/10 </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Parker: 6/10</strong></p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

De Villiers has been working for a broadcaster in South Africa for the Test series and claimed he knew something untoward could have been going on by how early the Tourists were getting the ball to reverse swing. Ultimately his suspicions were proved correct when, after searching for an hour and a half, the cameras spotted Cameron Bancroft rubbing sticky yellow tape on the ball in an attempt to alter its condition.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Jordan Seward</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T21:30:41.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Ex-South Africa captain reveals he helped snare cheating Australians</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T21:30:41.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5544927/MCC-criticise-player-conduct-South-Africa-Australia-series.html" title="MCC praise 'swift action' taken by ICC and Cricket Australia in ball-tampering scandal but criticise player conduct in South Africa series: 'Their behaviour has fallen well below the standard required'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5544843/Nasser-Hussains-player-ratings-Time-drop-Moeen-Ali.html" title="Nasser Hussain's player ratings: Joe Root needs to take responsibility for England's bowling attack and it is time for Moeen Ali to be dropped"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5544441/Steve-Smith-steps-Rajasthan-Royals-captain.html" title="Steve Smith steps down as Rajasthan Royals captain after ball-tampering scandal... so will Australia follow suit?"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5544221/BUMBLE-TEST-Australia-golden-chance-set-new-values.html" title="BUMBLE AT THE TEST: Australia have a golden chance to come up with a new set of values after this ball-tampering scandal... how many will be thought of as champions when they retire?"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5544667/Joe-Root-not-aware-ball-tampering-Ashes.html" title="Joe Root 'not aware of any ball tampering' during the Ashes but admits Australia scandal is 'disappointing for Test cricket' "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-5544129/Cricket-Australia-chief-jets-South-Africa-investigate-ball-tampering-scandal.html" title="Cricket Australia chief jets out to South Africa to investigate ball-tampering scandal as former coach John Buchanan questions current boss Darren Lehmann's role in saga"></link></item><item><title>Ford Fiestas are at risk as keyless car theft soars with police saying crooks hack into vehicles with electronic devices sold on Amazon and eBay</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5546751/Ford-Fiestas-risk-keyless-car-theft-soars.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 21:25:36 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5546751</guid><description><![CDATA[Although all models of keyless cars have been stolen – including luxury BMWs and Range Rovers – owners of Britain's most popular vehicle have been among the hardest hit.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

But it's been raised with other people, did he ever use protection?' he asked McDougal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'No. He didn't,' she replied. Cooper then asked if that was something that concerned her. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You know, we talked about it right beforehand. He was starting to and then he's like, I don't like these things. And you know, we discussed things. Did you do, blah, blah.

Cooper asked</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'No,' she replied. 'Did you ask him to?' said Cooper. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'No. I honestly didn't say anything,' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In prior conversations on Howard Stern's radio show, Trump has fondly recalled the days before rising rates of STDs made condoms necessary. He has also spoken about his obsession with cleanliness, however.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I own 25 percent of Goodyear Tire and Rubber,' Trump once told Stern in an apparent reference to the number of condoms he goes through.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You wear a rubber?' replied Stern.

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Tom Marcus revealed that a Russian agent was deported after he was caught with sensitive documents down his pants</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/russia/index.html">Russian </a>spies are the very best, which is why I used to love working against them when I was a deep-cover MI5 officer and surveillance expert. They truly understood how to operate on foreign soil as, under the guise of being diplomats, they operated out of the Russian Embassy in Kensington Palace Gardens.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They would hardly ever try to recruit members of the British Parliament because they knew the risks of being caught were incredibly high. Most of the time they were here to advance their country’s technical or military progress by targeting our defence companies and tech firms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I grudgingly admired them, because despite them trying to undermine this country, they would do it in a way that was subtle. Stealing secrets with a feather, that’s how the Russians generally did it. No sledgehammers involved — unless it was a reprisal on one of their own defecting agents (as we now know only too well with the nerve-gas attack on double-agent Sergei Skripal).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back in 2012, I’d been on this particular job for weeks, one of a team keeping surveillance on a Russian — codenamed Dirty Boot — every time his S-Class Mercedes with diplomatic plates left the Embassy. Then our main attention switched to his new contact: a tall, blonde-haired woman in her early 20s he’d recruited and was priming to spy for him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was a receptionist at an office of executive suites at Farnborough in Hampshire, just a stone’s throw from the premises of a top-secret tech company that specialised in satellite imagery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was vulnerable and was tempted. She’d left university with massive debts and had tried to supplement her income by taking on dodgy escort work. He drew her into his clutches by offering her a way out. He also promised her a new identity, a paid-for home and a job with the ministry in Moscow if she helped him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On his instructions, she started up a passionate love affair with a particular engineer on the satellite project at the nearby tech company. He was flattered by her attentions, fell into her arms and their pillow talk produced information about his sensitive work on lasers and the means to hack into his emails, text messages and voicemail.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

No sledgehammers involved — unless it was a reprisal on one of their own defecting agents (as we now know only too well with the nerve-gas attack on double-agent Sergei Skripal)</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’d planted eavesdropping equipment in her flat and at the engineer’s house and knew that he was unwittingly revealing enough about the top-secret technology he was working on for the Russians to replicate it back in Moscow and advance their country’s technology research and development by at least 30 years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was in my car keeping watch at Farnborough airport for Hungry Worm, our codename for the blonde. I had to be careful because, though it was unlikely that her Russian handler had given her any anti-surveillance training, I couldn’t follow her directly out of the car park if she left the building.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was bound to be wary, given the furtive nature of what she was up to, and she might suspect something wasn’t quite right even if she wasn’t experienced enough to identify exactly what was wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Word came through on the radio. There’d been a tip that the Russian was planning a meeting with Hungry Worm, probably so she could hand over secret documents she’d managed to get her hands on from her boyfriend.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But no one on our side knew where it was to be. He’d apparently left the details of where and when at a florist’s shop. ‘We don’t have any further intelligence, just a heads-up that it’s going to take place.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She had obviously been told not to use her mobile phone to text him, hence we had no electronic intercepts to go on. Nor could we send an agent into the flower shop to see what the message was, just in case the florist was a Russian recruit, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But we desperately needed to monitor that meeting — and, if possible, photograph it — if we were to gather the proof to present to the Russian Embassy and kick this guy out of the country for trying to steal our technology. The problem was we had absolutely no idea where it was to be held.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I watched as a white courier van pulled up outside the executive suite where the blonde worked and a woman got out with flowers and took them inside to deliver. Van and driver then left. I saw the blonde leave the building and head off to a bus stop on the main road. There she got on a nearly empty number 82 bus.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We couldn’t send someone to follow her on board. That would be too much of a giveaway. Cars would tail the bus, but still risked being spotted, if not by her then by Russian counter-surveillance who might have been tracking her movements.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And what if she gave us the slip? We had to find out where she was going. I decided to act on my own initiative rather than await orders.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Though it risked compromising the whole operation if I was spotted, I walked into the reception area of the executive suite. A fresh bunch of flowers was on the front desk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trying to appear as if I was just waiting for someone, I strained to see the greeting card on the flowers. The message was upside-down but I managed to make out the words: ‘My beautiful lady, meet you same time at the Crescent.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I turned away, spun an impromptu yarn to a security guard who’d asked me my business and left the building. Back in my car, I phoned in to base to give them the message.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <div><div> <span></span> <div></div></div></div><p class="imageCaption">They would hardly ever try to recruit members of the British Parliament because they knew the risks of being caught were incredibly high</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was enough for the boys there to rapidly check this new information against the pair’s known meeting places. The word came back: ‘Meeting place between Dirty Boot and Hungry Worm is believed to be at the RHS [Royal Horticultural Society] garden in Wisley, specifically the glasshouse.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The radio net was now buzzing as everyone swung into action and reported in. ‘Hungry Worm is off the bus,’ said a message from the surveillance team covering the blonde. Apparently she was waiting by the side of the road.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then: ‘Stand by! Stand by! Dirty Boot is in a black taxi and pulling alongside her.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This could be a calamity. The danger was that the Russian was on to us and had been following us as we tracked her movements. Was he now warning her off?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But we need not have worried. The blonde got into the taxi with the Russian and together they sped off.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The whole team was directed to get to Wisley in Surrey as fast as possible, but without being seen. With Russian targets, you need to remain in the shadows or they will rumble you. We couldn’t follow the taxi directly or overtake it without the risk of blowing our cover.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Getting ahead of them meant a hair-raising drive at top speed through side-streets and back routes. Overtaking anything in our path at 140mph, we set off a speed camera, but things like that don’t bother us. Fines, parking tickets and London congestion charges get paid by the service.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And we made it. We got to Wisley ahead of the taxi and were in position with cameras to snap it when it arrived. Another of the team was already on foot inside the gardens, taking pictures of the plant life with a long lens.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was good cover. One woman in her late 40s apparently photographing flowers could get a crystal-clear image of both targets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I sat in my car outside and waited. Suddenly the radio sprang to life again. ‘Black cab heading towards Wisley entrance.’ Followed by: ‘Dirty Boot and Hungry Worm now out and walking arm in arm towards the main building.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nobody else went inside the gardens, which was wise. If we’d flooded the place with agents, they would have stuck out like a sore thumb.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We hid ourselves around the area, using cars and buildings for cover.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The controller kept us up to date with a running commentary on what was going on in the glasshouse. ‘Hungry Worm has shown Dirty Boot a brown paper folder. Dirty Boot looked at the contents but did not take anything out. The folder is still with Hungry Worm. She put it into her handbag.’ I had to admire this. By leaving the folder with the blonde, the Russian handler technically hadn’t stolen state secrets. He was making sure he and Russia kept their distance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Either this was because he’d spotted us or, more likely that he was instinctively providing himself with an extra layer of operational security. His plan was to receive the actual documents at a later date and was merely checking them. Bloody hell, these Russians are good.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And then in a flash the secret rendezvous in the gardens was over. The Russian headed towards the exit, where the taxi they’d come in was waiting in the car park. He got in and it drove off, with him staring rather suspiciously out of the back window.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The order came to let it go. We were not to follow. The blonde hadn’t moved and so nor did we. ‘We stay with Hungry Worm and the folder. We can’t risk a loss here.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was a lot at stake. Whatever intelligence about lasers the folder contained was clearly top priority. Losing it could be catastrophic. The United Kingdom relies heavily on being on the front foot in technologies like this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s partly a question of money. Our research and development on weapons is among the most advanced in the world. If another country steals it, it could cost us billions of pounds in earning power.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More importantly, though, we stand to lose our ability to defend ourselves. If certain codes and equipment were handed over to foreign intelligence, it could render our submarines and quick-reaction fast jets useless.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most people don’t realise it, but the biggest threat to our country isn’t terrorists living among us and causing the occasional atrocity, it’s the smooth-talking suit like the one who drove away in a taxi.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By now, the blonde was also on the move, walking to the car park where she, too, was met by a black cab. Everyone was on high alert as it drove her — and that precious file — away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It passed me and I let it move round a bend in the road before following discreetly. One of our motor bikes joined the surveillance from a side street, tucking in out of sight behind the taxi.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another team reported an alarming development. In his taxi, the Russian handler had doubled back and was now behind the blonde, presumably checking she wasn’t being followed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We needed to be on top of our game here. It was vital he didn’t see us, but if we gave him too much room he’d get away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And he didn’t spot us, though it was a close call at times as this strange, strung-out circus of taxis, souped-up cars and motorbikes with leather-clad riders made its way along the dual carriageway and in parallel B-roads through the quiet English countryside.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By now, the Russian had closed up on the blonde’s taxi and together they pulled into a petrol station. The updates crackled over the radio: ‘Both taxis at the fuel pumps. Dirty Boot and Hungry Worm are walking into the shop at the garage.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I knew it. This was going to be the handover of the folder.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just moments later they emerged from the shop and went towards their respective taxis. But which one now had the folder? We had to know because it was a safe bet that the two cabs would now split up and go in different directions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Who to follow if we wanted to safeguard the file? Would we have to guess?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Classic spy-craft came to our rescue. One of the most experienced members of our team, a 30-year veteran, had spotted the Russian’s shirt was hanging out at the back. It hadn’t been when he went into the shop. He must have tucked the file underneath and forgotten to tidy his clothing. It was time to stop him. He could soon be photographing the paperwork in the back of the taxi or sending it directly to a secure server before destroying the evidence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But we had to make the right call. At the time, there was much tension between London and Moscow. If we got this wrong and arrested a bona fide diplomat for no good reason, it would be extremely embarrassing for Downing Street.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We needed to check him out and the contents of the taxi, but do it in a way that gave us a sliver of deniability should it all go pear-shaped.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So Dirty Boot’s taxi was allowed to drive off while an elaborate ambush was being planned up ahead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not long afterwards, a regular police car with its blue lights flashing pulled the taxi over on the A325, ostensibly to conduct a licence check on the driver as part of a crackdown on rogue taxis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The uniformed officers — one of whom was Special Branch and in the know — had a dog with them, which could sniff out drugs. When it reacted positively, they had an excuse to impound the taxi and detain its occupants.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was a tactic designed to give the Government a plausible story to spin should a war of words break out after we kicked the Russian ‘diplomat’ out of the country.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It didn’t come to that. Instead there was a final blast over the radio from base as the operation reached its climax:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Dirty Boot is handcuffed, and one of the officers is now pulling sheets of paper from the back of his trousers. Hungry Worm and her driver have been arrested too.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’d got them. Done a great job and got the proof! And we could all go home now. Along with the rest of the team, I was on a high, knowing that Russia’s best weren’t good enough for us.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the upshot? The next morning, we were informed that Dirty Boot, the Russian spy masquerading as a diplomat, had already been escorted to the airport and told to leave the country.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hungry Worm, the blonde graduate he had turned with his promises of money and a new life in Moscow, was still in custody and more than likely wouldn’t go to jail, as she was providing information on the Russian and how he contacted her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for the poor engineer who’d been suckered into unwittingly disclosing secrets, he was left puzzling over the sudden disappearance of his new-found love.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was never actually told one of his files had been whisked from under his nose and nearly made it to Moscow. Instead, he got a warning from his boss to be more careful about his personal security in future and not let his head be turned by a pretty girl.

The US has expelled 60 officials alone and shut the Russian consulate in Seattle following the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia this month. Today a former MI5 spy said Putin, a former KGB officer, will have been ready and will want to punish those responsible as Russia readies itself for a new Cold War.

It would be daft not to think that Putin would already been putting things in place'.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Martin Robinson</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T10:57:15.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Former MI5 agent warns that Putin is 'ten steps ahead'</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T10:57:15.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5548413/SIX-countries-considering-state-boycotts-World-Cup.html" title="SIX countries are considering boycotting the World Cup in response to Russian poisoning attack in Britain"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5547705/Australia-expels-two-Russian-diplomats-believes-undeclared-spies.html" title="Australia expels two Russian diplomats it believes to be undeclared SPIES following the nerve agent poisoning of a former spy and his daughter in the UK"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5544771/Ten-EU-countries-prepare-expel-Russian-spies.html" title="World turns against Putin: America and 22 other states expel Kremlin spies as May boasts of 'dismantling Russian espionage network' in wake of Salisbury poisoning - before Moscow vows to 'respond to every country' "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5546725/US-Navys-Virginia-Class-attack-submarines-equipped-nuclear-weapons.html" title="US Navy's Virginia Class attack submarines will now be equipped with nuclear weapons, which could double the number of subs capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5545055/Trump-kicks-SIXTY-Russian-spies-closes-consulate-retaliation-nerve-gas-attack.html" title="Trump kicks out SIXTY Russian spies and closes a consulate in retaliation for nerve gas attack in Britain blamed on Putin"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5543953/Up-feared-dead-Russian-mall-blaze.html" title="Footage shows shoppers fleeing flames in Russian mall inferno that killed 64 as politician says the building was 'built from s*** and sticks' and four people are arrested over safety issues "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5542591/Defence-Secretary-visits-UK-troops-Estonia.html" title="Defence Secretary visits UK troops on Putin's doorstep in show of strength three weeks after poisoning of Russian spy in Salisbury"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5542281/Putin-gives-Soviet-Union-gulag-glossy-museum-style-makeover.html" title="Care to visit the Gulag, comrade?

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Weathering the storm: 'She was prepared to discuss intimate details relating to Mr Trump,' Avenatti revealed on Today (Trump and Daniels above in 2006)</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels said she was threatened by that man to keep silent about her alleged sexual encounter on Sunday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The porn star, 39, claimed that she was threatened by an unidentified man in Las Vegas to keep quiet about her alleged relationship with Trump, an incident that she said happened while she was with her young daughter. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said in the interview that she had one encounter of consensual sex with the future president.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He knows I'm telling the truth,' said Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She did not allege however that she was coerced into the encounter with the real estate scion, saying, 'This is not a Me too. I was not a victim.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The adult film actress provided little new evidence of her alleged 2006 affair with Trump but said she faced intimidation tactics aimed at ensuring her silence in 2011.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels said that in the incident, in a parking lot, the man told her: 'Leave Trump alone. Forget the story.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She claimed he then looked at her daughter and added: 'That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels received a $130,000 payment days before the 2016 presidential election for her silence and has sought to invalidate that agreement in recent weeks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The White House did not immediately comment  on the interview, though Trump,  has denied the allegations mutliple times in the past through spokespeople and lawyers including Cohen, who claims that he paid the $130,000 out of his pocket.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He has also stated that neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Daniels and he was not reimbursed for the payment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avenatti provided evidence to 60 Minutes however that showed documents with Cohen using his Trump Organization email address in setting up the paymen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was also evidence that the nondisclosure agreement was sent by FedEx to Cohen at his Trump Organization office in Trump Tower.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the interview, Daniels described a sexual encounter with Trump that began with him talking about himself and showing her an issue of a magazine with his picture on the cover. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She then asked: 'Does this normally work for you?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That threw Trump off guard she claimed, going on to explain: 'And I was like, "Someone should take that magazine and spank you with it."'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels then ordered Trump to drop his pants and 'gave him a couple swats' in playful manner she said to Cooper.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said they talked some more after that and that she became more comfortable when he stopped speaking about himself.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He was like, "Wow, you - you are special. You remind me of my daughter." You know - he was like, "You're smart and beautiful, and a woman to be reckoned with, and I like you. I like you,"' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pair had dinner in Trump's room she said and then had sex. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He didn't use a condom, she said, and she didn't ask him to. Afterward, he asked to see her again, she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels said that before they had sex Trump had broached the idea of her being a contestant on The Apprentice, and she likened it to a 'business opportunity.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the alleged tryst she said he called her several times and would ask if they could get together again and would claim that he had an update for her about the Apprentice. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said she felt that he was holding out the opportunity to keep her coming back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Of course. I mean, I'm not blind. But at the same time, maybe it'll work out, you know?' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In July 2007, a year after they had met, Daniels said Trump asked to meet with her privately at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. She said they did not have sex, but he wanted to.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels reported that Trump called her the following month to say he had not been able to get her a spot on his TV show. She said they never met again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When asked why she was deciding to speak now, Daniels said: 'Because it was very important to me to be able to defend myself.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said she was not all that bothered by what other people thought of her, but had a big issuer with being portrayed as someone who did not tell the truth.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

You're taking advantage of this,"' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Yes, I'm getting more job offers now, but tell me one person who would turn down a job offer making more than they've been making, doing the same thing that they've always done?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cooper noted during the interview that Melania Trump had given birth just a few months before the alleged encounter between the two. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Did he mention his wife or child at all in this?' asked Cooper. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I asked. And he brushed it aside, said, "Oh yeah, yeah, you know, don't worry about that. We don't even, we have separate rooms and stuff,'' said Daniels. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just a few days prior, former Playboy model Karen McDougal told Cooper in a CNN interview that her affair with Trump began at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2006. McDougal said she ended the relationship in 2007 out of guilt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">McDougal has filed suit in Los Angeles seeking to invalidate a confidentiality agreement with American Media Inc., the company that owns the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer. It paid her $150,000 during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The lawsuit alleges that McDougal was paid for the rights to her story of an affair, but the story never ran. It also alleges that Cohen was secretly involved in her discussions with American Media.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump is also facing a New York defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Zervos has accused Trump of unwanted sexual contact in 2007 after she had appeared on the show with him, and sued after he dismissed the claims as made up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A judge ruled the lawsuit can move forward while the president is in office. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Stormy Daniels said on Sunday night that she made the decision to appear on 60 Minutes after President Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen suggested that she was a liar in an interview earlier this year. The Morning Joe team pointed out on Monday however that by speaking out about a claim she had previously denied in a signed legal document, the 39-year-old porn star was also changing her own story. That was not the only issue the panel had either, suggesting that Anderson Cooper and Daniels may have made a deal beforehand given the fact that he never really pressed her on any questions during the course of the interview.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Chris Spargo</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T11:44:57.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Morning Joe shreds Stormy Daniels' credibility, slams Anderson Cooper</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T11:44:57.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Donald Trump</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5544991/Stormy-Daniels-President-Trumps-genitalia-intimate-affair-says-lawyer.html" title="'She can describe his physical traits': Stormy Daniels' lawyer says she was ready to discuss intimate details of her alleged affair with Trump and more evidence will be released in coming weeks"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5545635/Twitter-asks-Stormy-Daniels-pupils-dilated-interview.html" title="'Why are Stormy Daniels' pupils so dilated in that bright room?'

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The porn star claimed that she was  approached by an unidentified man in Las Vegas and told to remain quiet about her alleged relationship with Trump, an incident that she said happened while she was with her young daughter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said in the interview that she had one encounter of consensual sex with the future president.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He knows I'm telling the truth,' said Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She did not allege however that she was coerced into the encounter with the real estate scion, saying, 'This is not a Me too.

You remind me of my daughter." You know - he was like, "You're smart and beautiful, and a woman to be reckoned with, and I like you. I like you,"' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pair had dinner in Trump's room she said and then had sex. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He didn't use a condom, she said, and she didn't ask him to. Afterward, he asked to see her again, she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels said that before they had sex Trump had broached the idea of her being a contestant on The Apprentice, and she likened it to a 'business opportunity.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the alleged tryst she said he called her several times and would ask if they could get together again and would claim that he had an update for her about the Apprentice. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said she felt that he was holding out the opportunity to keep her coming back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Of course. I mean, I'm not blind. But at the same time, maybe it'll work out, you know?' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In July 2007, a year after they had met, Daniels said Trump asked to meet with her privately at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. She said they did not have sex, but he wanted to.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels reported that Trump called her the following month to say he had not been able to get her a spot on his TV show. She said they never met again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When asked why she was deciding to speak now, Daniels said: 'Because it was very important to me to be able to defend myself.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said she was not all that bothered by what other people thought of her, but had a big issuer with being portrayed as someone who did not tell the truth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm not OK with being made out to be a liar, or people thinking that I did this for money and people are like, "Oh, you're an opportunist. You're taking advantage of this,"' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Yes, I'm getting more job offers now, but tell me one person who would turn down a job offer making more than they've been making, doing the same thing that they've always done?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cooper noted during the interview that Melania Trump had given birth just a few months before the alleged encounter between the two. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Did he mention his wife or child at all in this?' asked Cooper. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I asked. And he brushed it aside, said, "Oh yeah, yeah, you know, don't worry about that. We don't even, we have separate rooms and stuff,'' said Daniels. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just a few days prior, former Playboy model Karen McDougal told Cooper in a CNN interview that her affair with Trump began at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2006. McDougal said she ended the relationship in 2007 out of guilt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">McDougal has filed suit in Los Angeles seeking to invalidate a confidentiality agreement with American Media Inc., the company that owns the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer. It paid her $150,000 during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The lawsuit alleges that McDougal was paid for the rights to her story of an affair, but the story never ran. It also alleges that Cohen was secretly involved in her discussions with American Media.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump is also facing a New York defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Zervos has accused Trump of unwanted sexual contact in 2007 after she had appeared on the show with him, and sued after he dismissed the claims as made up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A judge ruled the lawsuit can move forward while the president is in office. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>There has been a deluge of new Stormy Daniels fans over the past few weeks, and the porn star is doing her best to capitalize on the situation.

The house, called Casa Ischia, boasts a dock big enough to handle a 130ft yacht, seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, a movie theatre, wine cellar and even a lift to move between the two floors.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Matt Smith</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T15:38:36.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Eddie Irvine puts stunning £21million Miami Beach home up for sale</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T15:38:36.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-5541199/Sebastian-Vettel-wins-controversial-Australian-GP-Lewis-Hamilton.html" title="Sebastian Vettel wins incident-packed Australian Grand Prix ahead of Lewis Hamilton after safety car confusion costs world champion opening 2018 race"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-5543899/Lewis-Hamilton-beaten-Melbourne-remains-title-favourite.html" title="Lewis Hamilton may have been beaten in Melbourne but he remains my favourite for a fifth title... plus a mixed weekend for McLaren, and how to make the Australian GP more exciting"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-5544407/Max-Verstappen-blasts-boring-completely-worthless-F1-Australian-Grand-Prix.html" title="Max Verstappen blasts 'boring and completely worthless' Australian Grand Prix, claiming he would have switched off had he been an F1 fan"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-5544495/Mercedes-begin-investigation-glitch-robbed-Lewis-Hamilton-Australian-GP-win.html" title="Mercedes begin investigation into glitch that robbed Lewis Hamilton of Australian Grand Prix victory "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-5541749/Plastic-bag-brings-Russian-rookie-Sergey-Sirotkins-F1-debut-end.html" title="Plastic bag brings Russian rookie Sergey Sirotkin's F1 debut to an end as he is forced to retire in Melbourne"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-5541727/Sebastian-Vettel-accepts-goading-Lewis-Hamilton-good-spirits.html" title="Sebastian Vettel accepts goading from Lewis Hamilton was in good spirits after pipping the Brit to victory at F1 curtain-raiser in Australia "></link></item><item><title>Premier League transfer fees may be crazy but the original big spenders were Italian clubs in the 90s - from £13m Gianluigi Lentini to £35m Hernan Crespo (and Christian Vieri's nine clubs in nine years!)</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5545675/Meet-original-big-spenders-Italian-clubs-90s.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 21:42:52 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5545675</guid><description><![CDATA[AMITAI WINEHOUSE: If some of the transfer fees thrown around this summer made eyes water and fists shake, at least they did not incur the wrath of god, unlike Gianluigi Lentini.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

  </div>

</div></div><div class="clear"></div><p class="imageCaption">Jean-Pierre Papin (left) and Gianluca Vialli both broke the world transfer record in 1992</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Archbishop of Canterbury did not comment on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's £35m move to Liverpool. There were no missives from the chief rabbi when Chelsea paid £70m for Alvaro Morata. The Dalai Lama kept out of the debate on Alexandre Lacazette's £46.5m switch to Arsenal. But the Vatican even felt moved to comment on Lentini's transfer, calling the fee 'an offence to the dignity of work'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prices in the Italian game were spiralling. In 1992, the transfer record was broken three times, twice by AC Milan either side of Gianluca Vialli's £12m move to Juventus, with Lentini the last. Milan were the first team to break the £10m threshold when they bought Jean-Pierre Papin that summer. The Premier League may have launched that year, but the eyes of the world were on Italy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, between 1990 and 2000, the world-record transfer fee was broken 10 times. On all but three of those occasions, the buying club played in Serie A. The last one, Hernan Crespo's move to Lazio from Parma for £35.5m, was both the peak and the moment before the fall of the Italian game – the Argentinian's move is the last time a club from the country has broken the record.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It caused a reporter from the BBC to ask the question: 'Has the world gone mad?'</p><div>



</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back to Lentini and 1992, though. Deities aside, at least the move initially seemed to work on the pitch. He was a key cog in Fabio Capello's side as Milan captured the Serie A title and reached the final of the Champions League, where they surprisingly lost to Marseille.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That would be Lentini's final hurrah as a player. In 1993 he was involved in a serious car accident and while he recovered, he was never the same player again. Too much was expected of a man who was dogged by memory loss and blurred vision.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Marcel Desailly summed it up: 'You could see the skills, how he was before the accident and after the accident, the balance was completely different'. Who knows how that £13m fee, exorbitant in retrospect, would have been viewed these days if he had not made the decision to drive back from a pre-season tournament in Genoa in August 1993?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Lentini was just one symbol of a period in which the Italian game ruled both the pitch and the transfer market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was not even those headline signings that stand out to this day. Take Christian Vieri, for example.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Bolognese striker was a good striker. But between 1991, when he made his debut for Torino, and 1997, he did not score more than 12 league goals in any campaign.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That did not stop him being at the centre of the market. Every year over an eight-year period, he switched clubs. Torino to Pisa. Pisa to Ravenna. Venezia to Atalanta. Atalanta to Juventus. 'Like Brigitte Nielsen', said Juventus owner Gianni Agnelli, 'he's not on the market.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wrong. Juventus sold him to Atletico Madrid, where he finally marked himself out as an elite goalscorer, with 24 goals in 24 La Liga games. But even then he did not settle, joining the nouveau riche of Lazio for £25m. </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

It was the first club he would stay with for more than a season, with Vieri eventually spending six years at the San Siro.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not that Vieri had an incredible impact on the fortunes of the Milan club. The goals came – 103 in 143 league games – but Inter did not win Serie A again until after Vieri left.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Part of the Vieri project for Inter was the intention to partner him up with another world-record-breaking signing, Ronaldo. The Brazilian's arrival at the San Siro from Barcelona for £19.5m in 1997 just symbolised where Italian football was at this juncture – whoever was good, they took.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pair never really worked together due to a series of injury problems. That was not the only challenge for Inter at that point.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lazio may have lost Vieri in 1999 but they gained something far greater within a year – only the second scudetto in their entire history.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cragnotti's arrival as owner in 1992 had changed the face of the club. He was responsible for Paul Gascoigne's signing, which had a big part to play in the United Kingdom's fascination with the Italian top flight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sven Goran Eriksson was the manager and built a brilliant attacking football side. He also had access to incredible resources, bringing in the likes of Marcelo Salas (£16m) and Juan Sebastian Veron (£18m).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the summer of 1998 alone, he spent eight-figure fees on Vieri, Salas, Sinisa Mihajlovic, Dejan Stankovic and Ivan de la Pena. Sky blue shirts aside, the comparisons with a modern day Manchester City are obvious.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And even after they won the title, they were not sated.

Over Eriksson's four years at the club, they won seven trophies. In their entire history to the point of the Swede's arrival in 1997, Lazio had captured just three pieces of silverware. 'It was very good because in Italy, if you win the league and you are not Milan, Inter or Juventus, it is a very big thing,' Eriksson recalled.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lazio really marked the end of Italy's peak spending years. There were notable moves after that point. Gianluigi Buffon's £33m transfer to Juventus from Parma in 2001 was the highest fee paid for a goalkeeper until Ederson joined Manchester City this summer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it was probably symbolic when Real Madrid smashed the world transfer record that same year to pluck Zinedine Zidane from Juventus for £46.6m. The previous Italian dominance of the market was over. The real wealth now lay elsewhere.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Still, they'll always have the 1990s.

Cavani marked his 100th cap by striking early in the second half as Uruguay sliced through a lapsed defence and showed the strides Wales need to make when the competitive action begins for Giggs. Gareth Bale will need to play better too if Wales are to reach Euro 2020 although Giggs defended his talisman by arguing Oscar Tabarez's side worked in packs to limit his threat.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>James Dutton</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T06:28:55.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Wales 0-1 Uruguay: Edinson Cavani settles China Cup final</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T06:28:55.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Uruguay Football,Wales Football</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5544209/Wales-vs-Uruguay-China-Cup-final-LIVE-Follow-action.html" title="Wales 0-1 Uruguay, China Cup final RESULT: Edinson Cavani goal denies Gareth Bale and Co in Nanning"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5544589/Swansea-ready-sign-Andy-King-Leicester.html" title="Swansea 'ready to sign Andy King on a permanent deal from Leicester' if they avoid Premier League relegation"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5543025/Bale-admits-Chinese-Super-League-switch-tempting-amid-fears-Real-Madrid-future.html" title="Wales star Gareth Bale admits Chinese Super League switch is tempting amid fears around his Real Madrid future: 'I'm sure that if I ever did come I'll be looked after very well'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5542487/Wales-star-Gareth-Bale-targets-2022-World-Cup.html" title="Wales star Gareth Bale targets 2022 World Cup as he admits missing out on Russia was a 'massive disappointment'"></link></item><item><title>Catholic bishop is caught with £19,000 stashed in a false wall 'after group of priests stole £425,000 from donations and wedding fees over three years' in Brazil</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5544695/Catholic-priest-caught-19-000-cash-stashed-false-wall.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 11:24:56 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5544695</guid><description><![CDATA[Police in Formosa, Goiás, Brazil, prised open fake panels in the home of Monsignor Epitácio Cardoso Pereira, to find 90,000 reais (£19,200) in plastic bags hidden in a secret storage space.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Up to 40 per cent could reach the surface and Australia is within the impact zone. The space station, which name means 'celestial palace' in Chinese, was launched in 2011 and, after completing its scientific missions, was decommissioned in 2016. Shortly after its retirement rumours began to circulate that China had lost communication with the 8.5 tonne piece of equipment as it hurtled through orbit.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Brett Lackey</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T06:46:12.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Out-of-control space station predicted to smash into Earth over Easter</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T06:46:12.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5547587/Robots-going-one-three-Australian-jobs-just-DECADE.html" title="The robots are coming!
