Start small so it's not overwhelming. For example, clear out a single drawer. Once you've done that you'll feel proud of your accomplishment, which will give you momentum for the next area. By breaking the task down into small individual steps, you're more likely to keep going. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2. Do a little every day. Some people find it helpful to set a daily recurring alarm on their phone to remind them to do a little bit of decluttering. Ten minutes is enough to do one drawer, one cupboard, or one storage shelf. It's amazing how a little bit every day adds up by the end of the week. </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group mol-hidden-caption" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">
    <img id="i-156e93e457cdac47" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/25/23/4A8E557F00000578-5542785-image-a-38_1522018617603.jpg" height="388" width="586" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" />
  </div>

</div>    </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">3. Have three bags or baskets beside you as you declutter. One is for things to throw out, the second is for things to donate, and the third is for things that don't belong in that zone and need to be re-homed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">4. Instead of thinking in terms of what to get rid of (which many people find difficult) think in terms of what you want to keep. Take everything out and only put back the things you know to be useful or believe to be beautiful. Keep in mind the 80/20 rule - we use 20% of our belongings 80% of the time. If it hasn't been used or worn in more than six months, it's time to let it go. </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group mol-hidden-caption" style="style"><div class="splitLeft"><div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div></div><div class="clear"></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">5. Decluttering is largely a mental game. We make many excuses to ourselves to hang onto what we own, even if we know objectively that we don't want clutter. When culling clothes, it may help to think in terms of a 'wardrobe average'. Some items of clothing are 10s, while others are 5s or only 2s. Get rid of the low-scoring clothes, because they lower your average. Challenge yourself to cull down to a capsule wardrobe that averages a strong 8 or 9 - items that you truly love and that fit beautifully. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">6. The next step after decluttering is maintenance. Keep a 'donate' basket in your storage cupboard with a garbage bag inside it. Throughout the week as you find items that are outgrown or no longer used, but are still in good condition, place them in the basket. When it's full, take the bag out and put it in the car to drop at the nearest charity bin. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">7. Follow the 'one in, one out' rule. When you make a new purchase, choose one thing in that same category to get rid of. That way your possessions won't balloon out of control.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group mol-hidden-caption" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">My mother and I were in WHSmith in Guildford on a Saturday afternoon when I first became aware of the power of good looks. We'd spent a very happy afternoon shopping when she remarked: 'You do know men are beginning to notice you, don't you?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then 15, I was a fairly unsophisticated schoolgirl for whom the purchase of a new pencil case held far more allure than the prospect of male attention.

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Unlike Sadie Frost, I was not blessed with film star looks or a figure fabulous enough to grace magazine covers. But, like many women, I had the power to make heads turn</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's lovely that heads turn towards a beautiful daughter, but that also means they overlook her mother. You are becoming invisible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I'm not unrealistic: on many days, I wouldn't look twice at myself in a mirror, so why would anyone else? But I'd be dishonest if I claimed that invisibility doesn't sting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is something Sadie Frost, 52, complained about last week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, it would be easy to accuse the British actress of more than a hint of narcissism. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After all, having been in the spotlight since her teens and been married to pop star Gary Kemp and actor Jude Law, she's enjoyed more glamorous moments than most of us have had trips to the supermarket. Some say she should be glad for her good fortune and learn to live in the real world.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, seeing as I'm grappling with precisely the same set of uncomfortable feelings, I wholeheartedly thank her for raising the issue. The truth is, as vain or vapid as it may sound to some, the gradual creep of invisibility is as cold and unappealing as last night's congealed leftovers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unlike Sadie Frost, I was not blessed with film star looks or a figure fabulous enough to grace magazine covers; I have never been able to play the vamp or had the seductive pull to net not one but two famous husbands.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, like many women, I had the power to make heads turn.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">From a woman's teens to her mid‑40s, a glorious cocktail of hormones and collagen gives you the power to command attention. Pictured, Annabel Cole aged 23</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">From a woman's teens to her mid‑40s, a glorious cocktail of hormones and collagen gives you the power to command attention, to be noticed by the outside world. After which, that mysterious allure vanishes as suddenly as it appeared.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A case in point: a few months ago, my husband unearthed our wedding video, unwatched since we got married 20 years ago. At the end, we discovered some footage of the reception which we couldn't recall ever having seen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We scanned the film, picking out familiar faces, until my husband paused on a shot of a small group including a woman with her back to the camera. 'Who on earth is that?' asked my husband with a slightly flirtatious glint in his eye. 'I don't remember her.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I gulped. 'It's me,' I said. The fact I'd changed out of my white gown into a little black dress for the reception had slipped his mind.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It wasn't the fact that my husband didn't recognise me (I've got used to his clangers over the years and, looking on the positive side, he was at least noticing the woman he married).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What struck me was that — even without as much a glimpse of her face — he was reacting to the presence of a woman basking in the glow of youth. He didn't recognise me because that isn't me any more. There couldn't be a clearer example of my current state of invisibility.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All the old clichés apply here. Youth is wasted on the young and, of course, you only know what you've got when it's gone. In my late teens and 20s, being able to attract a longing gaze was as much a part of my daily life as shopping in TopShop or going to the wine bar on a Friday night.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As I moved through university and then into my first jobs in my 20s, I experienced the power of what I would now define as being a 'visible woman'. And it had little to do with dates and boyfriends.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ability to be noticed was most evident in the smaller things: the awareness that people looked up when you walk into a room; the fact that almost any conversation might have the potential to carry on over a drink.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the most thrilling things I can ever remember happening to me was as a 21-year-old at the University Library in Cambridge, studying for my finals. I got up to fetch a book from the stacks and returned to my place in the reading room to find an anonymous note, which simply said, 'You look fantastic'. I still have it.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Annabel Cole writes that it's not superficial to mourn the loss of your ability to turn heads</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Getting married in my mid-20s and giving birth to three children in quick succession, I embraced motherhood. I was happy to say goodbye to my single self and be engulfed by a new, noisy unit of five.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The usual challenges of motherhood were there: the exhaustion and 24-hour demands of little ones — as well as keeping a marriage on track — were hard but surmountable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like most young mums, I spent months in the sandpit and too many hours spooning goop into unwilling mouths. I had no time for blow-dries — a staple of my former office life — and any kind of stylish outfit went out of the window while I relied instead on a lacklustre uniform of flat shoes, shapeless jeans and food-splattered jumpers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But even after a tough day, if we were lucky enough to find a babysitter, I could still pull it out of the hat. Give me an hour alone in the bathroom, I could recover the old me. Back then I was still visible. I could command attention. I could always bounce back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was as a mum of three children under five, holidaying in Austria, that I was picked on the street to star in a national ad campaign for McDonald's. And at adventure playgrounds, dads would ask me if I was the nanny … which I secretly loved.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There's no doubt that with visibility and allure comes a degree of harmless flirtation. Being so deep into young motherhood, an affair was the very last thing on my mind. But knowing that I could still stir feelings, make a splash, was a real and welcome ego boost.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But about two years ago when I was 44, that ability began to slip through my fingers. And it had more to do with clocking up birthdays than the ravages of child-rearing. I actually feel that I look better in some ways than I did when I had little kids — I'm certainly better dressed — but it's the allure that dies. That magic head-turning ingredient.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I hadn't put on weight but my figure suddenly lost its shape; I became fitter than I have ever been through hours of walking our new puppy — but my legs turned to tree trunks.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Youth is wasted on the young and, of course, you only know what you've got when it's gone. Pictured, Annabel with her daughter Elsa</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the same time, my skin lost its glow and no amount of make-up or expensive creams brought it back. In short, I went from being a picture which caught the eye to the wallpaper you hang it on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To answer feminists who declare they don't want to be defined or compromised by their looks, I couldn't agree more heartily. But the power of being a visible woman is not confined to attracting men. It's about commanding attention from anyone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As acutely as I have noticed a lack of male attention in recent years, there's the absence of scrutiny by my own sex, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A new outfit doesn't garner the glances from other smart women that it used to; testers in the perfume department don't immediately make a beeline for me any more. I am just not on their radar. Superficial? Absolutely. But, nevertheless, it hurts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what about inner beauty? Surely truly beautiful women, of any age, radiate a sense of confidence which transcends looks?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Spare me! The diminishing ability to attract attention is as fundamental a part of the ageing process as the emergence of the first streaks of grey hair or discovering you can't read fine print quite as easily as you used to.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, at 46, I feel far happier in my skin than the stationery-loving 15-year-old in WHSmith, but ironically it's just as you reach your inner prime that invisibility sets in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once you hit your 40s, you quite literally begin to fade away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The contours of your face lose definition and the skin begins to look less plump. Lips which were once full and sensuous appear narrow and mean. The little smile which used to look tempting now unleashes a fan of fine lines. Skin takes on a lacklustre pallor. Hair fades to grey. Whatever your figure was like in the past and even if your weight has stayed constant, I can guarantee it will change — and not in a way you'll be thrilled about.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And if you imagine bewailing invisibility is a yet another symptom of today's aggressively looks-orientated celebrity culture, I would beg to differ.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">George Eliot wrote her 1866 novel Felix Holt, The Radical when she was in her mid-40s. In it, she uses the character of the sorrowful, middle-aged Mrs Transome to, among other things, explore a woman's acute awareness of her waning beauty and the loss of the influence it once wrought.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My daughters are now 15 and 18 and we've already had our WHSmith moment. I remember helping my elder daughter get ready for her leavers' ball at school. In her long dress and a pair of my borrowed shoes, she suddenly looked like a young woman.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I kissed her and wished her a wonderful evening as her mother, but squeezed her arm and whispered to her, woman to woman: 'You look amazing, but be careful — use your power wisely.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I take great pleasure from watching my girls grow into self-confident young women, conscious of their femininity and having fun with it but using it wisely. Unlike Sadie Frost, who described feeling 'irrelevant' compared to the bright young things of today, I don't feel sidelined by younger people. I enjoy their company, socially and professionally.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, despite all of these wonderful gifts, it's difficult to accept that at a time when you feel your best on the inside, the outside has not kept pace. Somehow, it makes daily life just a little more prosaic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The incidental exchange you might have had on the Tube which you knew was just that and absolutely nothing more; the attention when you walk into a crowded room; the occasional glance that says: 'You still have it.' When these evade you, you notice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It might not seem important at the time, but whoever you are, whatever your history, you miss it when it is gone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>My mother and I were in WHSmith in Guildford on a Saturday afternoon when I first became aware of the power of good looks, writes ANNABEL COLE (pictured left, aged 23, and right, today, with her 14-year-old daughter).

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Unlike many of those who extol the virtues of ‘clean eating’ or set themselves up as ‘wellness’ gurus, I want to set out my credentials right at the start.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m not just another health blogger offering a transformational plan or miracle cure, armed with only a pretty plate of food and a marketing strategy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am a trained biochemist and nutritionist who is registered with the Association for Nutrition.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m a scientist and a sceptic, who, nowadays, spends her time tackling the myriad food myths that plague what has become an entire industry surrounding the concept of ‘wellness’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I wasn’t always so hard to impress. Not long ago, I was the one falling for every nugget of pseudo-science handed to me by wellness bloggers, including (but not limited to): cutting out various food groups from my diet; believing I needed ‘superfood’ powders to be healthy; not eating gluten; juicing for health; and even doing week-long raw vegan ‘cleanses’.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

  </div>

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Scientist Pixie Turner reveals the truth behind all those fashionable healthy eating fads - and admits she once fell for them too</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then, on holiday on the east coast of Australia, surrounded by wellness zealots even more extreme than me, I had an epiphany and began to question the evidence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When I compared their food philosophies and advice with the science, it just didn’t match up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From that point onwards, I made it my mission to challenge every fad and unscientific principle, one by one, in the face of hard facts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The truth is that trendy diets, detoxes — food itself — can’t cure every ailment or bestow perfect health. That’s just not how the human body works.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is high time that more of us became wellness rebels and cultivated a happy, rather than anxious or scared, relationship with what we eat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, read on for the most prevalent foodie wellness myths, busted by science.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>THE DETOXING MYTH</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How many times have you heard someone claim the wonders of a ‘full-body detox’ or a ‘spring detox’? ‘Detox to get that summer body,’ we are told, or even: ‘Detox your weekend away!’ But do detoxes work?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let’s start with juice cleanses, which require you to consume juice and only juice for several days — and make sure it’s raw, organic, cold-pressed juice, not supermarket-brand orange juice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Detox evangelists solemnly inform us that a juice cleanse will ‘hydrate our cells’ (just like a glass of water), ‘make our skin glow’ and help us lose weight and gain energy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But a juice diet is lacking in fibre, can be high in sugars and is likely to be low in protein. Its lack of sodium can make you dizzy. And if you’re having just pure vegetable juice, there is a complete absence of carbohydrates, which will make you feel tired — the opposite of what’s promised.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s expensive, too, and it doesn’t lead to positive, long-term lifestyle habits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even if you’re just using the cleanse to lose weight, chances are, you’ll regain the pounds once you go back to eating food.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And what about the humble glass of lemon water — an infusion of lemon in hot water — recommended by a whole host of wellness warriors, who claim that it ‘flushes out toxins’ and ‘wakes up the liver’ first thing in the morning?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Well, first of all, your liver doesn’t need waking up. If your liver went to sleep every time you did, you probably wouldn’t wake up again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And secondly, heed the caution of dentists, who warn that consuming acidic lemon water every day can wear away enamel and damage your teeth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>THE GLUTEN MYTH</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the past couple of years, increasing numbers of people have gone gluten-free, often at the behest of a group of wellness bloggers spouting unfounded assertions. ‘Gluten is like sandpaper for the gut,’ they say, and blame it for a whole host of vague, non-specific symptoms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let’s get this straight: there are legitimate reasons for not eating gluten. The only way to manage the autoimmune condition coeliac disease, which damages the gut lining and causes serious gastric symptoms, is to eliminate gluten totally from your diet, while those who suffer from a wheat allergy can also benefit from cutting out gluten. But the rest of us? Not so much.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Less than 5 per cent of the population have a legitimate problem with gluten.</p><div class="mol-img-group floatRHS" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Less than 5 per cent of the population have a legitimate problem with gluten, such as those with coeliac disease - but approximately 12 per cent of us in the UK have gone gluten free</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet, according to the BBC, an estimated 8.5 million people in the UK — approximately 12 per cent of us — say we have gone gluten-free. This means a huge number of people are excluding gluten unnecessarily.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Proving a self-diagnosis isn’t as simple as cutting out gluten, seeing whether your symptoms improve and assuming that therefore the cause of any issues must be gluten. Lots of things cause gastric discomfort. Often, if someone experiences bloating after eating a large bowl of, say, pasta, the problem isn’t the pasta itself, but overeating, eating too quickly or not chewing properly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When blind testing is tried, where people are given foods without knowing whether they contain gluten, many of those who self-diagnose some form of gluten sensitivity observe no reaction to gluten, which suggests that it’s not the problem — they just think it is.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And going gluten-free may not be healthier. Many alternatives have a range of additional ingredients to compensate for the lack of gluten and are often higher in sugar and fat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A gluten-free diet has also been linked to a reduction in beneficial bacteria populations in the gut. A key to gut health, and therefore overall health, is having a varied diet with a whole range of foods. So why not let that include grains and gluten (unless you have a medical diagnosis of coeliac disease)?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’ll make your social life easier, it’ll make you happier (carbs make you happy!) and it’ll mean you don’t have to live your life without the pleasure of eating bread.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>THE ALKALINE MYTH</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The alkaline diet is based on the premise that the body functions best in a slightly alkaline state and that illness is due to acidity in the body.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Proponents say what we eat and drink affects the pH of our bodies, including the blood, so we need to consume an abundance of alkaline-forming foods (mainly fruit and vegetables) and avoid acid-forming foods (mainly meat and dairy). From a purely nutritional perspective, anything that encourages the increased consumption of fruit and veg is a good thing, since 70 per cent of us admit not eating our five-a-day.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS femail" data-version="2" id="mol-01ae8760-3067-11e8-9654-f99118c27b37">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">DON'T BE TEMPTED BY A TEATOX</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

  </div>

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Teatox products often contain a herbal laxative which makes you lose water weight</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">So-called ‘teatox’ products are herbal ‘detox teas’ sold in health food shops that are meant to be drunk two to three times a day, either around 30 minutes before each meal, or once in the morning and once at night.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Often, these teas, or at least the evening brew, contain a herbal laxative called senna, which makes you lose water weight. This can trick you into thinking the tea is effective for weight loss when it’s not (you are really just losing water weight and when you stop the laxative, you will put that water weight back on). Laxatives don’t cause fat loss or ‘detox’ the body.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And beware: senna can have side-effects, including fatigue, dehydration, dizziness, cramps, colon damage, pain, diarrhoea and dependency on laxatives. </p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The problem is that the alkaline diet also comes with a number of unfounded claims — that people who are too ‘acidic’ show symptoms of anxiety, fatigue, headaches, insomnia and high blood pressure, for example.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, the health claims range from the relatively benign — such as weight management and reducing acne — to the much harder to believe, such as curing cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, your body’s pH is tightly controlled. When you consume foods, the pH of the food is changed in different parts of the body to match the ideal conditions for digestive enzymes: first acidic in the stomach, then more alkaline in the intestines.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pH of blood is kept between 7.35 and 7.45 — anything below pH 7.35 is considered acidosis, and anything above 7.45 is considered alkalosis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Blood pH is so tightly controlled because a deviation of more than 0.4 pH units either way is fatal. Being ‘too acidic’ isn’t something you can just quickly change by eating some greens; it involves going to hospital and treatment with intravenous lactate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Being too alkaline is just as serious a problem, with treatment involving intravenous chloride solution.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It comes down to this: a diet high in ‘acidic’ foods — that is, a diet low in fruit and vegetables — is a typical Western-type diet. We know this kind of diet has negative health consequences, but this is not because it makes your body ‘acidic’ in any way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, ditch the labels and the dichotomy and just eat a balanced diet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>THE SUPERFOOD MYTH</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Believe it or not, coconut oil is around 85 per cent saturated fat. Remember that a diet high in saturated fat as a percentage of overall energy intake is linked to increased risk of heart disease — yet coconut oil has somehow reached ‘superfood’ status, thanks to some clever marketing tactics and exaggerated scientific claims that give it the illusion of credibility.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A lot of the claims for coconut oil are extrapolated from research into a type of saturated fatty acids called medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which are described as ‘fat-burning fat’ because they are quickly metabolised for energy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here’s the science bit: MCTs have between six and ten carbons, whereas lauric acid, the main fatty acid component of coconut oil, has 12 carbons and, therefore, is not considered a ‘true’ MCT.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

  </div>

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">In moderate amounts, coconut oil is neither ‘good’ nor ‘bad’ but, like butter, should not be eaten in excess</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once you dig down into the science, you see that it’s a bit of a stretch to apply the benefits of MCT to coconut oil. Indeed, the evidence, according to a research paper from 2016, ‘does not support popular claims purporting that coconut oil is a healthy oil in terms of reducing the risk of [heart disease]’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In moderate amounts, coconut oil is neither ‘good’ nor ‘bad’ but, like butter, should not be eaten in excess. It is a saturated fat, and I can’t in good faith recommend putting it in your coffee every morning, as many wellness bloggers do.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, let’s turn to the superfood powder fad. Bought in big tubs from health food shops, to be sprinkled into smoothies or over porridge, these powders are said to punch well above their weight in terms of nutrition and health.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But do we really need them? No, we don’t. They are expensive and the claims made for them are dubious. Most of them taste pretty awful, too . . .</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>THE RAW FOOD MYTH</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Raw foodism is based on the (incorrect) belief that uncooked food is intrinsically healthier than cooked.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, raw food does contain good-for-us enzymes and cooking does destroy these when it heats them to above 40c or so.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But do you know what else destroys enzymes? Your digestive system, which exists at a comfortable pH of around 2–3, thanks to the production of gastric acids.</p><div class="mol-img-group floatRHS" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

By cooking food, you are often helping to avoid food poisoning</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your body can’t use plant enzymes — they get broken down in your stomach just like any other protein would, and your body uses the resulting amino acids as building blocks to make other proteins.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cooking food can remove toxins such as cyanogens and lectins, and it kills bacteria and parasites that could harm you. By cooking food, you are often helping to avoid food poisoning.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In some cases, cooking food can break down certain vitamins, but in others, it makes them easier for your body to use. In many instances, cooking breaks down indigestible plant components, which means better access to the nutrients inside. So it’s not clear-cut and depends on the food.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I should probably point out that cooking foods to oblivion or excessively charring them isn’t recommended, but light cooking has some clear health benefits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What really matters is eating the vegetables.

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Tom Markle, pictured above on Friday, will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle for the royal wedding on May 19, a close friend told The Mail on Sunday</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meghan Markle’s reclusive father will walk her down the aisle, a close friend has told The Mail on Sunday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After months of speculation about whether retired Hollywood lighting director Tom Markle will be by his daughter’s side in Windsor Castle, one of his closest confidantes last night confirmed: ‘He will.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And Kensington Palace has been told that the 73-year-old will be flying in for the ceremony from Mexico, where he lives in a sleepy retirement community.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He’s very excited about it,’ said the friend: ‘He’s very close to her [Meghan] and he’s very happy. All the pressure has been hard on him and he’s just trying to stay out of the limelight.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The woman also said Mr Markle does not know what he will wear on the big day adding: ‘The Royal Family controls that. We’re not sure.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She declined to be named – but, after being pictured sharing a pizza with Mr Markle at a local restaurant last week, denied that she was romantically involved with Harry’s future father-in-law.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Markle has not yet met the Prince, and it is not known when he will. But his friend said: ‘He likes Harry. He thinks he’s very much a gentleman and he’s looking forward to the wedding.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has been rumoured that Meghan could break with convention and have both her father and her mother, Doria, walk her down the aisle on May 19.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Doria, 61, met Harry at last year’s Invictus Games in Toronto, and the Princehas described her as ‘amazing’. Tom and Doria, a social worker, divorced when Meghan was six, and she has subsequently been closer to her mother.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A family source said: ‘Meghan sees more of her mother because Tom leads such a quiet life, but she adores both her parents. It would surprise no one if she has both her mother and father accompany her.Tom has said from the start that he wants to walk her down the aisle, and that has never changed.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Mail on Sunday spoke to Mr Markle outside his seafront bungalow yesterday. He confirmed the woman who spoke to this newspaper was ‘a good friend’ – but nothing more. ‘I have no girlfriend,’ he added. ‘Have a good day, man.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He met the young mum, an American, in the street when she was with her ten-year-old daughter. ‘He told me how cute she is and that he misses his kids,’ the friend said. ‘My daughter reminded him of when his kids were little.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Markle – who moved to Rosarito Beach in Mexico after being declared bankrupt in 2016 – has previously called Harry and Meghan ‘a very good match,’ saying: ‘It’s wonderful. I’m very happy for them.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last week the wedding invitations were finally sent out.

Has there been healing of past hurts?

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Sydney sexologist Dr Nikki Goldstein revealed her tips to survive a dry spell when you are in a relationship, marriage or single</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what defines dry spells? Dr Goldstein explained how the time-frame varies for everyone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Dry spells are different for everyone. It could be a few weeks for some while others say it's six months or even years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Everyone has different levels of sexual desires so it's difficult to reveal [time frame]. It's a dry spell when you say it's a dry spell.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>RELATIONSHIP</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If you're not having sex, look at the importance of sex in your relationship,' she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Take out sexual pleasures and orgasms, and look at what's missing from your intimacy, it's important to create that in a relationship rather than sex.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Bring back affection, touching and make sure you're kissing everyday, every morning.  Whatever the reason is on why you're going through a dry spell, it's all about intimacy and it's not always about sex.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Goldstein said it was important for couples to enjoy sex as much as they can - and frequency will naturally vary for different couples.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

I  get worried that couples are just having sex to feel normal because they saw the figures in an article or something.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Couples should be looking at the types of sex that works for their relationship not just having sex to keep the numbers up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So when you're not enjoying that type of sex, this could lead to boredom - and this comes in because you're having sex for all the wrong reasons.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She likened sex to children with toys.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's like a kid with a toy - they play with it a lot at the beginning. They love the toy and still keep it in a toy box but they are not playing with it as much as they first did.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So don't freak - it's not a matter of losing spark but it's about changing the spark to something more satisfying. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If you want to continue the primal sex, you're not thinking of what to explore such as fantasies - things that you can do in an intimate relationship so you can bond and get to know someone better.'</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

But over time these stains penetrate the enamel and cause more ‘permanent’ intrinsic stains which are much harder to remove. So keep drinking them but brush away those tannins as quickly as you can.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Drinking chilled still water after every meal or rinsing your mouth with water will help to swill away any debris that could stick to teeth and linger and I’d advise using floss or interproximal brushes twice a day to dislodge build-up between the teeth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Read on to find out the other dental hygiene mistakes that can harm your teeth, and how to put them right. </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

In fact, sucrose or table sugar and glucose are rapidly absorbed in the upper gut, which is why athletes use them to refuel during competitions,' she added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Table sugar is efficiently absorbed in the top part of your digestive tract... This means it doesn't actually get into the lower part of our gut, where the trillions of microbes live and therefore essentially can't directly affect them.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Rossi added that a more accurate explanation of why you shouldn't 'sugar load' is if you do, you're unlikely to be able to get in your daily 30 grams of dietary fibre:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Sugar is not a "toxin" to gut health,' she concluded.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Like most things small amounts as part of a balanced diet won't harm your gut lining or microbes.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>To read more from Dr Megan Rossi, you can visit her website </strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drmeganrossi.com/"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.

Few things are more ageing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We hear the cry time and time again that middle-aged women feel invisible. Too often, this is because we are actively trying to blend into the background. Anxious not to be the proverbial mutton, we veer towards the far-too-conservative.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As many a stylish middle-aged woman has observed, you have the capacity to learn for your entire life — so why not about clothes?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You may have developed something of a ‘uniform’ over the years (a useful thing, in fact), but that still needs tweaking and updating.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You don’t stop being interested in new books or films or art when you turn 40, so why should you stop caring about style?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there’s the sheer joy of the thing. What can be more invigorating than the purchase of a real wardrobe-changer? There’s no age-limit on that feeling. Though this is not to say all fashion trends should be taken up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m not suggesting you scoop the latest shorts suit, dive headlong into feathers or pile on the ruffles. What I am urging is that you don’t turn away from fashion’s power to rejuvenate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That you take a moment to remember there is no such powerful antidote to feeling invisible than feeling sartorially relevant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It may only be a little tweak, a focus on detail, an update of colour palette, but the effects are huge.

Wear said sequin item with your wardrobe’s most quiet and minimal pieces.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Uterque sequined ankle boots will elevate a pair of black, tailored trousers.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>PASTEL TAILORING </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By pastel tailoring, we mean a suit or suit jacket in an ice cream shade. From vanilla and strawberry to mint and lemon, tailoring has had the sweetest of makeovers. Gone are the serious hues (black, navy, charcoal) reminiscent of carving out deals in the boardroom.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pastels, anti-ageing, I hear you cry? Surely, this is mother-of-the-bride territory through and through. Not so. For starters, ice cream shades are far more forgiving on complexions than, say, black, or even navy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More importantly, today’s ice cream shades have been whipped into pin-sharp tailoring: smart jackets, neat coats, immaculate shirts, slim trousers, natty dresses. While they effervesce femininity in the colour department, shapes remain graphic and clean. No bows or frills here.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Marks &amp; Spencer’s Limited Edition has completely nailed the lavender look with some of the High Street’s best tailoring hits. As has Principles at Debenhams. But be warned: while these sweetie shades are kind to most mature skin tones, you should wear only one pastel at a time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And to save from a saccharine overload, use a white T-shirt as a highlighter.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

Only the most judiciously placed frill — such as a single waterfall ruffle on an otherwise streamlined dress or shirt — can work wonders in elevating the ordinary. Too many and it calls to mind lampshades, loo roll dollies and flamenco dancers. Likewise, feathers. Both trends smack of fancy dress.

You don’t stop being interested in new books or films or art when you turn 40, so why should you stop caring about style? I’m not suggesting you scoop the latest shorts suit, dive headlong into feathers or pile on the ruffles. What I am urging is that you don’t turn away from fashion’s power to rejuvenate.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Dianne Apen-Sadler</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T14:19:07.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Six spring trends that will take years off you</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T14:19:07.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5541829/Kitri-green-pleated-dress-sells-24-hours-released.html" title="Is THIS summer's must-have dress?

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Had my son shut his bedroom window, all would have been fine. But he’d gone out to meet friends, leaving it wide open. I noticed the howling gale and went in to close it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The chocolate was just lying on his desk, and it caught my eye. A chunky bar, half out of its gold foil wrapping, with two squares broken off the end. Ooh! The temptation was too much. I grabbed one square and ate it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was about to nab the second — except it tasted really weird. Sweet, but with a sour earthiness. I paused and found the outer wrapper in among the mess of his desk. ‘Milk chocolate with cannabis oil,’ it announced. Oh heck!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It will just be joke stuff,’ I told myself. My son, Tom, is 18, and has just started at university, but apart from a normal teenage fondness for getting boozed up with his mates, he’s shown no signs of odd behaviour or drug-taking — though he’s a great one for practical jokes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Was I surprised? Astonished, but no more than by other things he has got up to in the past year, such as ordering fake ID online or dealing in digital currencies. But cross? Not really. Kids will be kids.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Jenny Morris took some chocolate that was just lying on her son's desk that had cannabis oil in it (file photo)</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">So instead of calling to berate him, I went back to my desk. It was 5.30pm and I had just been given a work deadline for the following morning, which was going to be a tight squeeze because I was also going out, for a non-negotiable dinner with my girlfriends.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For half an hour, all was fine. I sent emails and wrote with energy and unusual fluency. But by 6pm, I began to feel strange. At first, it was just a slight disconnect when I moved my head, like the loss of balance that comes with being very drunk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Uh oh! Maybe this stuff wasn’t so innocuous. I decided to go and get supper ready for the rest of the family before I went out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Walking down the stairs, I felt unsteady. Just a little spaced out, I decided. But my brain was working fine. There was bolognese sauce defrosting. I heated it up, cooked some spaghetti, and frizzled up diced chorizo to put into the spinach salad I was taking to supper with my girlfriends.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By 6.30pm, my husband was home, and so was our daughter, Tom’s elder sister. Concentrating on acting normal and stirring the sauce, I told them what was up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘So is it all “Hey, maaaan . . .”?’ mock-drawled my husband. ‘No it’s not,’ I snapped. ‘I’m fine. But I do feel a bit odd.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My daughter was properly concerned and asked the sensible question: what exactly had I taken?</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I had no idea. I texted Tom saying: ‘You know that chocolate on your desk…’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was on the line in seconds, sounding really worried. ‘Mum, seriously, make yourself sick!’ he commanded. I could hear his mates laughing like hyenas in the background. I giggled and said it was too late.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Mum, it’s mar-ij-u-an-a. It’s strong, you’re going to get quite high. You mustn’t go out,’ he insisted. ‘And whatever you do, don’t drink.’ Eek.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He gave up on me and texted my husband and daughter, telling them to watch me closely, and that if this was a business dinner, they must stop me from going. His friend, Jack, had got so paranoid on this stuff he had ended up in A&amp;E.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The silly thing is, I’m such an old square that I have made it to my 50s without ever taking drugs, so I had no idea what I was in for. The nearest I’d got was watching a joint circling a friend’s dinner table in 1985.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now there was a heavy pressure across the back of my head, behind my eyes. No wonder it’s called being stoned — I feel like I’ve been hit on the head with one, I thought crossly, trying to drain spaghetti. My fine motor skills were clearly going to pot, pun intended.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I thought dope was meant to be fun,’ I moaned to my daughter. ‘I feel terrible.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It does seem to depend on the mood you are in when you take it,’ she advised.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What was her experience of cannabis? I asked, feeling astonished even to be having this conversation. Not much, she said — but clearly more than mine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was hard to concentrate on what she was saying, not least because my hearing seemed extra sharp and I was distracted by the noise of the bolognese glopping as it simmered on the other side of the kitchen. How peculiar.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Reasoning there was nothing I could do except ride this one out, I insisted I was fine to go out — I’d already made the salad and I couldn’t let my friends down — so my husband drove me the 500 yards to my friend Bea’s house, and briefed her on what had happened while I stood blinking owlishly in her doorway.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She gave me a very old-fashioned look. ‘I’m absolutely fine,’ I said, then knocked over the glass of water she gave me.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">By 6pm, she began to feel strange. At first, it was just a slight disconnect when she moved her head, like the loss of balance that comes with being very drunk (file photo)</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the cab on the way to meet our other friend, I thought I was making perfect sense, despite a touch of motion sickness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bea thought otherwise. ‘You are so not all right,’ she said, leaning forward to tell the cabbie to double back to take me home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘So kind of you,’ I mumbled as she held my arm and steered me, still clutching my dish of spinach salad, back through my own front door. I sat at the kitchen table feeling slightly in disgrace and ate my cold salad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It tasted OK, though it probably hadn’t been a good idea to pour the hot oil from the chorizo in there. ‘I did wonder why you were doing that,’ said my daughter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Oh dear. It was only 7.45pm but I was feeling worse and worse. At least with alcohol, I know where I am on the scale of sober-to-inebriated. Now, I was clueless.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Half the world, I told myself, thinks cannabis is so innocuous it should be legalised. You’ll be fine. Yes but, said another voice in my head, modern dope is so much stronger than it used to be. What if it’s like that Spice stuff that just poleaxes people?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘How long will this go on for?’ I asked my daughter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She didn’t know. ‘When my friends take it, they tend to keep on smoking, so it goes on for quite a bit.’ My husband tried telling me about his day, but my brain kept hanging up between thoughts, just like it’s meant to do in meditation but never does.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I tried to help with the washing up but my husband shooed me away. ‘Go. To. Bed.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was far too early. I drifted to the tumble dryer to sort laundry, increasingly amazed by different textures of the socks I was handling. Who knew those grey ones were so soft?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘OK,’ chipped in the logical part of my brain, still struggling to assert itself. ‘You’ve got a heightened sensation of touch. Make a note. Add that to the loss of fine motor skills and the stuff that’s going on with your hearing.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By 9pm, I gave up, crawled into bed and lay on my back. Aah! That was better.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My limbs felt as if they were melting into the mattress. My head felt floaty. Belatedly, I could imagine myself lying in the grass on a summer afternoon like this, relaxed and listening to music. That could be sensational.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I think I need to listen to The Dark Side Of The Moon,’ I announced to my husband, before instantly falling asleep.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The next morning, I emerged cautiously from bed and was relieved to find I seemed to be fine, if a bit dopey.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And I’d had nine hours of sleep. Wow! There was a silver lining.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My son, to his credit, was mortified. When he got home he enfolded me in a huge bear hug, repeating his apologies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m relieved to have emerged from this deeply unpleasant experience unscathed, but I am also astonished that he would bring this stuff into our house.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When we have both recovered ourselves, I am going to sit him down for a big chat about the seriousness of breaking the law and the very real risks associated with drug-taking — even of a substance so many of his friends seem to regard as innocuous — and reinforce the dim view I take of all this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I for one will never be touching the stuff again. Nor will I be nicking any stray chocolate that I find....</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">All names have been changed to protect identities.</span> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Jenny Morris's son left some milk chocolate with cannabis oil on her desk which she decided to eat a square.

The efficacy and safety of isotretinoin is based on more than 3,000 patients assessed in clinical trials, over 30 years of clinical experience and the ongoing review and assessment of 90 regulators from around the world. More than 17 million patients worldwide have received isotretinoin since it was first introduced in 1982.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">'We understand that severe acne can cause some sufferers to become depressed and can also affect their mood and self-esteem.

It also concluded that there was an increased risk of attempted suicide during and after treatment with isotretinoin, but that this additional risk is most likely due to the acne rather than the treatment.

He’s known for the ‘Lancer glow’ achieved by careful exfoliation; Victoria Beckham credited him with sorting out her ‘problematic skin’.

That’s polish (exfoliate), cleanse, then nourish (cream). He believes in gentle daily exfoliation to stimulate production of collagen, the protein that keeps skin firm. His polish contains tiny crystals, so it doesn’t strip the skin. His Nourish moisturiser has grape polyphenols to help skin retain moisture plus hyaluronic acid and hexapeptide 48 to reduce wrinkle depth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>VALUE:</strong> The Polish is £60 for 120ml, Cleanse is £48 for 120ml and Nourish £105 for 50ml (spacenk.com).

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Angela Neustatter, pictured, gives transcendental meditation another go as part of the latest throwback to the Swinging Sixties seeing a resurgence in popularity</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">TM, as they called it, epitomised the mood in youth culture: offering them a way to tune into a higher state of being, find spiritual harmony and to escape the conservative culture in which they had grown up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, of course, TM was taken up by none other than John, Paul, George and Ringo, after the Fab Four met the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who developed the technique and founded the Maharishi Foundation to spread the movement internationally. Famously, the Beatles spent weeks studying with the guru in India, making him their spiritual adviser.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over several months, I also attended evening sessions at a canalside centre where candles flickered, statuettes of Eastern gods stood on a table and the air was rich with a mix of incense and joints smoked before people got down to meditating.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Amsterdammers liked to make TM a touchy-feely experience, so we would link arms and sit cross-legged in a ring, or bear-hug each other at the beginning and end of a session. On one occasion we were commanded to go down on all fours, move around and rub noses. That was a hippie move too far for me, but I did come to appreciate the value of sitting quietly and reciting a ‘mantra’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the defining characteristics of TM, as opposed to other types of meditation, is that you are encouraged to repeat a specific word, to help clear your mind.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eyes closed, we would let the mind be as free as we could, to reach a state that felt as restful as sleep, but to remain awake.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was intrigued by the idea that something so simple could be an antidote to the state of internal chaos that I experienced all too easily.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, although I didn’t attend TM sessions regularly, I would call on the technique when the pace of life and work wore me out. Yet, when I returned to England at the end of the Sixties, the practice was starting to be discredited.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Beatles’ relationship with their guru had soured and I stopped turning to the technique in moments of stress.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then, last summer, my husband, Olly, and I spent four days at the Horakuan Temple in the mountains of Northern Japan, where we meditated twice a day and were struck by how good it felt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Uncharacteristically, we didn’t have a moment of domestic discord during that time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was reminded of how TM had once helped me reach a state of calm in Amsterdam and, back in London, signed up for a four-session, one-to-one course.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am not the only one showing renewed interest in TM.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Stella McCartney and Oprah Winfrey say they have come to rely on TM, and Meghan Markle, we hear, practises a similar meditation twice a day.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img" style="height: auto;">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it’s not just the rich and famous. The David Lynch Foundation — a non-profit organisation set up by the American filmmaker 13 years ago in an effort to make TM available to troubled children, women in refuges and the homeless — has set up a base in the UK and is running pilot schemes, teaching TM at three schools in London.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So it is I find myself facing a small shrine with a basket of flowers and a flickering candle, while incense fills the room with a spicy aroma.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The centrepiece is a coloured portrait of a guru with explosive beard and striking dress and I anticipate that my own teacher will be similarly exotic. Instead, David Hughes, a clean-shaven, soft-spoken man in a dark suit, born in the North of England, introduces himself as my guide through the TM course.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">David discovered TM as a 19-year-old and trained with the Maharishi in the 1970s.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He works with both the David Lynch Foundation and The Maharishi Foundation, which offers public courses in transcendental meditation. David begins the first of our four 90-minute sessions by explaining that society is suffering from ‘an epidemic of stress’, which could be reduced if TM were commonly practised.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There have, he says, been more than 600 scientific studies published linking the practice to drops in coronary heart disease, reductions in blood pressure and great improvements in mental and emotional health.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One particularly striking study reported by the American Journal of Cardiology, and funded by the U.S. government, found that a group of older people practising TM over a sustained period suffered 30 per cent fewer deaths from heart disease and 49 per cent fewer from cancer than those in a group who didn’t meditate at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">David tells me what to expect. ‘TM is ridiculously simple and it should be an effortless process.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It is not about concentration, mind control, or being guided, but about enabling the mind to [in the words of American TM teacher, Bob Roth] transcend and effortlessly access the deep stillness that lies within every human being.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The practice is not associated with any belief system, he adds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I want to understand the difference between TM and mindfulness, the popular movement that encourages us to focus on the present to promote mental health. ‘TM,’ says David, ‘is about not harnessing the mind to anything, so that it can find its way to a reservoir of pure happiness, dynamism and creativity’, transcending surface-level thinking to move towards silence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In contrast, mindfulness is about controlling the mind to clear it of thoughts. But how do I practise TM now? Amsterdam was a long time ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">David gives me a mantra to use as I meditate. This is a meaningless word, he explains, to help me let go of mental chatter. I am to recite it loudly at first, then reduce it to a whisper. And I am sworn to secrecy — telling anyone my personal mantra apparently diffuses its value.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">David gives me a mantra to use as I meditate. This is a meaningless word, he explains, to help me let go of mental chatter. I am to recite it loudly at first, then reduce it to a whisper</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">We then find a comfortable way to sit and close our eyes, setting the mind free to move towards the state of inner tranquillity. This state can be tapped into without making a conscious effort or any further training, I am told, if I simply keep meditating for two 20-minute sessions a day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I won’t pretend I achieved instant bliss in this first session. I hadn’t reckoned with the army of chatterboxes inside my head reminding me I need to buy food, pick up my grandson and finish an article — sabotaging any notion of inner calm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During our second session, David tells me I am seeing these incoming thoughts as the enemy — distracting and stopping me reaching the stillness level. ‘Do not fight them,’ he instructs, ‘just let the mantra take over.’ This time, thoughts and questions drift past me like clouds and I am aware of the way my breath quietens.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Between sessions, I meditate at home and feel peaceful and relaxed at the end.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At our third session, David talks about the difference it can make to day-to-day well-being if we know that in just 20 minutes we can distance ourselves from problems that appear insoluble. It’s then possible to tackle them more calmly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But how much of these benefits stem from auto-suggestion, where if you want to believe something enough, it seems to happen? David tells me: ‘If you keep up the daily sessions for more than three months and feel the benefits, then it is real. Placebo effects wear off after this length of time.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some people say TM doesn’t work for them, he adds. ‘They fear they’re not spiritual enough. It can be difficult to grasp the idea that finding the process challenging is the point.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By our fourth session I think I have got that. I find myself determinedly making time for the twice-daily meditations at home. But David has seen this kind of instant conversion before and knows disillusion can kick in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I should not expect a dramatic change in myself, he warns, but find a sense of well-being and relaxation during practice. The benefits increase if you make TM a lifetime habit, he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Certainly, I hope to keep it up so I can reach the promised state of ‘pure consciousness’ over years ahead, but I know that the spirit can be weak.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That said, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr still practise TM and I am inspired by Ringo declaring that meditating helps him ‘make molehills out of mountains’. Now, if only I could find my old joss sticks . . .</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Transcendental meditation courses at the Maharishi Foundation start from £290.

Her miracle baby boy Rhylan had been a surprise as she had endured four years of IVF before being blessed with her first born Lehnae, who was just 14 months old when she was diagnosed. The Perth-based mum has since won Mother of the Year, formed a strong support base and community online dubbed "Farrah's Army" and thankfully, been told she is 'cancer-free'. Here, Farrah (left and right in February before her third breast surgery and inset in 2016) reveals what life is like after a cancer diagnosis, why the definition of 'cancer-free' is different for everyone and what all women should know if faced with a similar battle.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Laura House</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T15:12:17.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Mother diagnosed with breast cancer just 18 HOURS after giving birth</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T15:12:17.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Cancer</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3586190/Farrah-Millar-sharing-heartbreaking-journey-page-FarrahsArmy-diagnosed-breast-cancer-18-hours-giving-birth.html" title="'I might never see them grow up': The heart-wrenching moment a mother was told she had stage three breast cancer... 18 HOURS after giving birth to her 'miracle' baby"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3803337/Farrah-Millar-named-Mother-Year-diagnosed-breast-cancer-18-hours-giving-birth.html" title="'When they told me I'd won I was so shocked I fell off the bed': Woman who was told she had stage three breast cancer just 18 HOURS after giving birth is named Mother of the Year"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3586190/Farrah-Millar-sharing-heartbreaking-journey-page-FarrahsArmy-diagnosed-breast-cancer-18-hours-giving-birth.html" title="Farrah Millar is sharing her breast cancer journey on page #FarrahsArmy | Daily Mail Online"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://nbcf-steps-towards-research-great-wall-challenge-2018.everydayhero.com/au/checkyourboobiclesinchina" title="everydayhero: NBCF Steps Towards Research Great Wall Challenge 2018"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.everydayhero.com.au/event/NBCF-Steps-Towards-Research-Great-Wall-Challenge-2018/sponsor_a_friend" title="Everyday Hero Australia: NBCF Steps Towards Research Great Wall Challenge 2018"></link></item><item><title>'Many of us get thrush, so why the hush?'
