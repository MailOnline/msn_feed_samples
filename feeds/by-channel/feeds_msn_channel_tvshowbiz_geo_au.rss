For those paying full price, one night at the beachside destination can cost between $800 and $1330, depending on the time of year. Davina was staying in the NSW tourist hotspot to celebrate her 27th birthday. The former Zoo Weekly model, who became infamous for her 'affair' with  Dean Wells on MAFS, shared several photos from her five-day stay to Instagram. She has over 340,000 followers, making her an in-demand 'influencer'.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Joe Scrimshire</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T10:34:04.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Davina Rankin gets ‘reduced rate’ stay at luxury Byron Bay retreat</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T10:34:04.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Married At First Sight Australia</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5547089/Tracey-Jewel-Davina-Rankin-form-revenge-pact-destroy-Dean-Wells.html" title="Attack of the vengeful brides!

Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Australia, she said that Telv is a kind-hearted, respectful person - and not at all like Harry T portrayed him to be. 'My son is a gentleman,' she said resolutely, adding that he is committed to his children. On Sunday, Harry T took a swipe at Telv, claiming that his friend Sarah was upset by his allegedly 'inappropriate behaviour'. 'She just couldn't tolerate such unacceptable and inappropriate behaviour from him when they were supposed to be in a committed and loving relationship,' he said. In the past few weeks, Telv, 33, has been embroiled in several scandals. A video surfaced of him snorting an unidentified white powder off a stripper's behind. It also emerged Telv had pleaded guilty to one count of assault, with no conviction recorded, stemming from an incident when he was 18. 'He was 18 then he's now a 33-year-old man,' Tracey said, emphasising that he has long since moved past that incident.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Joe Scrimshire</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T10:30:03.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>MAFS star Telv Williams' mother defends her son amid Sarah controversy</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T10:30:03.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Married At First Sight Australia</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5545345/MAFS-Davina-Rankin-reveals-REAL-reason-branded-Tracey-Jewel-crazy.html" title="Shock twist!
