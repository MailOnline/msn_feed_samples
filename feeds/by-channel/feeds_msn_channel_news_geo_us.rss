No good attorney would,' said Avenatti.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There's gonna be a lot of evidence  that will come to light in the coming weeks and months and we're confident that when all of the facts are laid bare for the American people they're gonna learn exactly what happened here.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This includes the identify of the individual who allegedly threatened Daniels back in 2011 and how she received her reported $130,000 payout after signing a non-disclosure agreement two weeks before the election.  </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avenatti said that while President Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen may have cut the check for $130,000, he is not the person who ultimately covered that sizable payout. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think when all is said and done, it will be clear that it did not come from [Cohen] or there was a promise of reimbursement,' stated Avenatti. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Regardless, Mr Cohen and the president have a significant problem related to this $130,000 and the agreement.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He addressed the individual who threatened his client seven years ago as well, soon after she detailed her alleged one-night stand with President Trump in an interview. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It had to have come from someone associated with Mr. Trump,' explained Avenatti. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It didn't come from the magazine. That makes no sense. It was certainly not my client. There's only one other place that could have come from. And that threat was terrifying to my client.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When asked if his client told anyone or went to the police after that threat, Avenatti responded: 'She was scared. No.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was then pointed out that this might make the story difficult to stand up, which Avenatti denied, saying: 'I don't think so. I think we're going to get to the bottom of this. The threat, the agreement, the bottom of the $130,000 payment.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels' lawyer also said at one point that President trump had never denied the affair, a claim which was met with immediate push back as it was pointed out there have been many denials. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Well actually, the president has never denied it. He's been silent. He can tweet on every other subject known the mankind. For some reason, he can't deny the affair,' said Avenatti. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He can't come out and deny the existence of the agreement and his knowledge of it. And can't deny the $130,000 payment. Why is that?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avenatti also addressed whether or not he was concerned about his client possibly losing everything, as she is now facing a $20 million lawsuit for speaking out. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Our position is that the NDA was never executed and it was never valid for a host of reasons and we're confident that a court is going to find that, he stated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We have a litany of more evidence in this case. And it's going to be disclosed. And it's going to be laid bare for the American public.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He then confirmed that this included direct evidence to prove an affair occurred between his client and President Trump. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avenatti ended things be responding to a question about why he chose to hold back during his client's big moment on Sunday night.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I don't think that was our biggest possible platform and we're gonna be smart and we want to be deliberate,' he explained. </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">They're still in love: Eric Stewart of 10cc and his wife Gloria pose in 1970 </p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">After all, when they'd met — at one of his gigs at Halifax Town Hall in 1964 — he'd been poleaxed by the beautiful 16-year-old. ('I went gaga! Completely gaga!' he says today.)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, then, Eric thought again. Even better, he secretly wrote an ironic song explaining exactly how deeply he adored her, how desperately he pined for her when he was away, how he hung her picture on his wall and gazed at it — all without using those three little words.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric wanted to write a love song for his wife without saying 'I love you'. He wanted to show the conflict between feeling a certain way, yet avoiding those words.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The result, I'm Not In Love, was a massive hit in 1975, going to No 1 in charts all around the world; it earned endless royalties and inspired an entire generation of musicians.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Everyone over the age of 40 knows the lyrics 'I'm not in love, so don't forget it; it's just a silly phase I'm going through'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The song has been the soundtrack to countless romantic moments. It also made Eric and fellow Mancunian band members, Graham Gouldman (who co-wrote the song), Kevin Godley and Lol Creme, very rich. Even more important, it placated the lovely Gloria. Earlier this month, they celebrated their 52nd wedding anniversary with a big dinner for friends.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Eric Stewart and his wife Gloria are pictured celebrating a wedding anniversary in recent year</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We try to be romantic — we send each other cards and flowers and surprise each other. It's important to keep that side going,' says Gloria, who is still a vision, with blonde hair, pink cheeks and great legs. 'Even if sometimes someone needs a bit of a reminder . . .'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric is more prosaic. 'The fact it's lasted 52 years, especially in the music business is bloody astounding,' he says. 'Because you're tempted all the time!'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now 73, he looks more like a rather meek music teacher than a rock star who has worked with all the greats, from Paul McCartney to the Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder to James Brown.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As he offers me a flapjack, it's easy to forget that, in the halcyon days of the mid-Seventies, 10cc — christened in 1972 by record producer Jonathan King (later convicted of child sex abuse) who signed them to his label and then had a dream about a chart-topping band under that name — were the most popular group in the world for a time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That night he met Gloria in 1964, Eric, a 19-year-old self-taught guitarist, was well established on the music scene. His band, Wayne Fontana &amp; the Mindbenders, was riding the wave of their first major hit, and was a popular live attraction throughout the UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gloria, who'd grown up on a dairy farm in Haworth, West Yorkshire, was still at school, although modelling in her spare time. She'd gone along to the gig in Halifax with her friend, Pauline Matthews (now better known as the singer, Kiki Dee).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Apparently, Kiki quite fancied me!' says Eric, pink-faced at the notion. 'But when Gloria walked in I was dumbfounded. She was gorgeous, stunning. It was love at first sight!'</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img" style="height: auto;">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Gloria met Eric, a 19-year-old self-taught guitarist, when he was already well established on the music scene</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">He asked if she'd like to hop in the band's van to see a gig in Manchester with Eric Clapton later than night. 'Yeah. OK,' was Gloria's reply. And in an instant, her dreams of A-levels and art school flew out of the window.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ignoring her father's gruff 'I'll give it two years', she became wife to one of the biggest pop stars in the world at just 18. On their wedding day, March 10, 1966, the Mindbenders (without Wayne Fontana) were back at No 2 with A Groovy Kind Of Love.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gloria's father shouldn't have worried because Eric and his band members — the Mindbenders and 10cc (which grew out of trio called Hotlegs) — were never very rock 'n' roll.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They didn't smash up hotel rooms — 'I was more likely to fix a broken shower rail than break anything. I love mending things!'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And until The Beatles introduced him to Scotch and Coke ('a very dangerous drink'), even booze was thin on the ground.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There was no time,' he says.

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">10cc went on to have five of their albums certified gold</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before I'm Not In Love, 10cc had had a string of hits and were the critics' darlings, but that song put them in the major league.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric played with the Stones and adores Keith Richards ('he's crazy now, but I still love him'), dislikes Jagger ('rude and a prima donna'), built a multi-million-pound house in Surrey and snapped up a slew of fast cars and a holiday house in Barbados, where they hung out with the McCartneys.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The couples were great friends, both living in East Sussex. Paul and Eric played together, and Linda and Gloria went horse-riding. Both battled breast cancer at the same time, but while Gloria survived, Linda, sadly, didn't.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric and Gloria were not big partygoers and never embraced drugs. Marijuana sent Eric to sleep and 'did nothing' for Gloria, other than give her 'a scratchy throat'. The closest they came to the hard stuff was in the late Seventies, when Eric and jet-lagged U.S. drummer Steve Gadd snorted cocaine every night for a week while recording.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When I played back what we'd done, it was awful! Never again,' says Eric. 'And never LSD — the Beatles tried it, John and Paul, and they really did suffer later.' Eric's most rock-starry splurge was his car collection — Bugattis, Jaguars, Alfa Romeos. 'I once got up to 174mph on an empty motorway in a Ferrari Boxer, with Gloria in the passenger seat!' he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gosh! What on earth did she say?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Slow down! And don't do it again. It was a thrill, but she was right.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But one night in 1979, she wasn't there to tell him off. Driving back from his studio, a little too relaxed after a couple of rum and Cokes, seatbelt undone, he hit a spot of black ice and crashed into a tree.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric fractured his skull, damaged his left eye and lost the hearing in his left ear. It took him a year to recover and, when he did, 10cc's time in the spotlight was fading.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It was a very difficult time,' says Gloria quietly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today, the cars are all gone. 'Now she tells me off for buying too many sweaters!' says Eric.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, all marriages are full of ups and downs and Eric and Gloria have had their share.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's been a rollercoaster and I'm not sure how we've managed to stay together all this time,' says Gloria. 'But we have. It can only be because we just love each other.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But also because they've worked at it, focusing on joint interests — doing up houses (here and in France), walking the dog, going out for dinner together at least once a week — and spending time with their two children (they had a son, Jody, in 1980) and their grandson, Christian.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Does Eric use the 'L' word now?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Oh yes! Every single night! 'Goodnight, I love you,' I say, just before we turn the lights out. And she always says, 'I love you' back.' </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>After nine years of marriage, one daughter and years of enforced separation caused by relentless touring with his band 10cc (inset), Eric Stewart’s wife Gloria (pictured left and right together) started complaining that he no longer told her he loved her. Her grumbling fell on deaf ears. ‘If I said it all the time, it would lose its meaning,’ he would protest. Which, to Gloria, felt a little thin. But, then, Eric thought again. Even better, he secretly wrote an ironic song explaining exactly how deeply he adored her, how desperately he pined for her when he was away, how he hung her picture on his wall and gazed at it — all without using those three little words.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Alex Green</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T13:54:19.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>The wife’s grumble that made her husband write 10cc’s I’m Not In Love</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T13:54:19.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5540585/Reunited-Spice-Girls-stars-plan-animated-adventure-starring-characters-voiced-band.html" title="Spice Girls wannabe superheroes: Reunited pop stars plan an animated adventure starring characters based on and voiced by the band members"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5535671/Children-left-swinging-20-MINUTES-ride-hit-power-failure.html" title="'We thought they were going to fall off and die': Terrified parents watch as their children are left swinging mid-air for 20 MINUTES when fun-fair ride is hit by a power failure in Bristol "></link></item><item><title>Former New Orleans Saints cheerleader sues the team, claiming she was fired for violating its rules when she posed in a one-piece swimsuit </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5544661/Former-New-Orleans-Saints-cheerleader-sues-team-swimwear-picture-sacked-for.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 11:22:25 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5544661</guid><description><![CDATA[Bailey Davis said she was fired after three years with the New Orleans NFL team, who claimed she had violated its extremely strict code of conduct.

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Stormy Daniels (right) told Anderson Cooper (left) that she spanked the now-president when they first met, and that a man threatened her back in 2011 after she spoke to a tabloid magazine about the alleged affair with Donald Trump</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There are old, recycled reports, which were published and strongly denied prior to the election,' an unnamed official told the newspaper.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another denial of Trump's came via Cohen. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'President Trump once again vehemently denies any such occurrence as has Ms. Daniels,' Cohen said.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He didn't deny the payment at the time, though later admitted to making the transfer. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels, in her interview with 60 Minutes, explained she had signed off on a statement denying the affair this year 'because they made it sound like I had no choice.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She told Cooper that because she had signed the non-disclosure agreement, if she didn't sign the statement she was concerned she would be in legal peril.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'As a matter of fact, the exact sentence used was, "They can make your life hell in many different ways,"' Daniels said she was told. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During his rounds on morning television Monday, Daniels' attorney Michael Avenatti also pointed out that Trump has never personally denied the relationship. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Well actually, the president has never denied it. He's been silent. He can tweet on every other subject known to mankind. For some reason, he can' deny the affair,' Avenatti said.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He can't come out and deny the existence of the agreement and his knowledge of it. And can't deny the $130,000 payment. Why is that?' Daniels' lawyer also challenged. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When reporters asked Trump about the interview as he was traveling back to Washington, D.C., Sunday night he ignored their questions.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump is being told to keep his mouth closed, as advisers think it's not a good look for a president to be in a public he-said, she-said with a porn star, according to <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/rebeccaballhaus/status/978348236019822593">reporting from the Wall Street Journal</a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On CNN Monday, former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci expressed just that.<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/cnn/index.html"> </a></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Well, listen, I haven't talked to him about this specific strategy here, but I think the best thing to do here, and if I was offering any advice: Let it go, at this point, and move on,' Scaramucci said. 'Let the news cycle create another news cycle and it will be different information out there.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Mooch also suggested that even if the president had a decade-old extramarital liaison with an adult film actress, it's not such a big deal in 2018.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think there will be less fallout than people think because people have been anesthetized to these sort of scandals, it goes all the way back to President Clinton,' Scaramucci said. 'So to me, I think that, we'll talk about it, there will be another news cycle and then people will move on, that's my prediction.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over on Fox &amp; Friends Monday morning, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley wasn't even asked about it. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In his series of morning show interviews, Avenatti hinted things could get worse for the president. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 60 Minutes interview, for instance, could have been tawdrier. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'She was prepared to discuss intimate details relating to Mr. Trump,' the porn star's lawyer said. 'She can describe his genitalia. She can describe various conversations that they had that leave no doubt as to whether this woman is telling the truth.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And if she's not telling the truth, let the president take to the podium and call her a liar,' the lawyer continued. 'Let the president come forward and say it never happened.'    </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While Shah used a lack of evidence to make his case from the White House podium, Avenatti had already indicated on Good Morning America that there could be some coming down the pipeline.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We're in the very early stages of this case, and we're not gonna play all of our cards at this juncture. No good attorney would,' said Avenatti.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There's gonna be a lot of evidence  that will come to light in the coming weeks and months and we're confident that when all of the facts are laid bare for the American people they're gonna learn exactly what happened here,' the lawyer said. </p><div class="mol-img-group floatRHS" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Porn star Stormy Daniels was given $130,000 in hush money by President Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen (pictured) weeks before the 2016 presidential election </p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">This could include the identity of the individual who approached Daniels in 2011 in Las Vegas as she was on the verge of going public with her story in a sister publication to In Touch Weekly. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels explained to Cooper during her 60 Minutes interview that she was approached by a man while with her young daughter.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And a guy walked up on me and said to me, "Leave Trump alone. Forget the story." And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, "That’s a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom." And then he was gone,' Daniels said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said, seven years later, she'd still be able to recognize him. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If he walked in this door right now, I would instantly know,' Daniels told Cooper. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avenatti charged Monday morning, 'It had to come from someone associated with Mr. Trump.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It didn't come from the magazine. That makes no sense. It was certainly not my client. There's only one other place that could have come from. And that threat was terrifying to my client,' the lawyer said.   </p><div class="mol-html" id="mol-a932c1e0-312f-11e8-8e03-9dd84b994011">                            <div><blockquote class="twitter-video" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On the heels of her bombshell interview, Stormy Daniels' attorney joins us in Times Square to discuss her claims <a href="https://t.co/j1x8wnwRN1">https://t.co/j1x8wnwRN1</a> <a href="https://t.co/aMk2vlGdrd">pic.twitter.com/aMk2vlGdrd</a></p>— Good Morning America (@GMA) <a href="https://twitter.com/GMA/status/978233226333364224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2018</a></blockquote></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels told 60 Minutes she didn't go to the police after the threat because she was scared.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More details about the $130,000 payment could come out too.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think when all is said and done, it will be clear that it did not come from [Cohen] or there was a promise of reimbursement,' Avenatti said, suggesting that President Trump was more heavily involved. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cohen has said that he made the payment using his own funds and acted independently from the then-presidential candidate.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Regardless, Mr. Cohen and the president have a significant problem related to this $130,000 and the agreement,' Avenatti charged. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels' lawyer also sounded confident that his client could get out of the non-disclosure agreement she signed and avoid a potential $20 million fine for speaking out.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Our position is that the NDA was never executed and it was never valid for a host of reasons and we're confident that a court is going to find that,' Avenatti said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said in the interview that she had one encounter of consensual sex with the future president.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He knows I'm telling the truth,' said Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She did not allege however that she was coerced into the encounter with the real estate scion, saying, 'This is not a "me too." I was not a victim.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> Daniels said her night with Trump began with him talking about himself and showing her an issue of a magazine with his picture on the cover. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Does this normally work for you?' Daniels said she told the then-reality TV star.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That threw Trump off guard she claimed, going on to explain: 'And I was like, "Someone should take that magazine and spank you with it."'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels then ordered Trump to drop his pants and 'gave him a couple swats' in playful manner she said to Cooper.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said they talked some more after that and that she became more comfortable when he stopped speaking about himself.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He was like, "Wow, you - you are special. You remind me of my daughter." You know - he was like, "You're smart and beautiful, and a woman to be reckoned with, and I like you. I like you,"' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pair had dinner in Trump's room she said and then had sex. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He didn't use a condom, she said, and she didn't ask him to. Afterward, he asked to see her again, she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels said that before they had sex Trump had broached the idea of her being a contestant on The Apprentice, and she likened it to a 'business opportunity.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the alleged tryst she said he called her several times and would ask if they could get together again and would claim that he had an update for her about the Apprentice. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said she felt that he was holding out the opportunity to keep her coming back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Of course. I mean, I'm not blind. But at the same time, maybe it'll work out, you know?' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In July 2007, a year after they had met, Daniels said Trump asked to meet with her privately at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. She said they did not have sex, but he wanted to. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels reported that Trump called her the following month to say he had not been able to get her a spot on his TV show. She said they never met again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When asked why she was deciding to speak now, Daniels said: 'Because it was very important to me to be able to defend myself.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said she was not all that bothered by what other people thought of her, but had a big issuer with being portrayed as someone who did not tell the truth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm not OK with being made out to be a liar, or people thinking that I did this for money and people are like, "Oh, you're an opportunist. You're taking advantage of this,"' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Yes, I'm getting more job offers now, but tell me one person who would turn down a job offer making more than they've been making, doing the same thing that they've always done?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cooper noted during the interview that Melania Trump had given birth just a few months before the alleged encounter between the two. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Did he mention his wife or child at all in this?' asked Cooper. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I asked. And he brushed it aside, said, "Oh yeah, yeah, you know, don't worry about that. We don't even, we have separate rooms and stuff,'' said Daniels. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just a few days prior, former Playboy model Karen McDougal told Cooper in a CNN interview that her affair with Trump began at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2006. McDougal said she ended the relationship in 2007 out of guilt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">McDougal has filed suit in Los Angeles seeking to invalidate a confidentiality agreement with American Media Inc., the company that owns the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer. It paid her $150,000 during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The lawsuit alleges that McDougal was paid for the rights to her story of an affair, but the story never ran. It also alleges that Cohen was secretly involved in her discussions with American Media.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump is also facing a New York defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Zervos has accused Trump of unwanted sexual contact in 2007 after she had appeared on the show with him, and sued after he dismissed the claims as made up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A judge ruled the lawsuit can move forward while the president is in office.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The White House hit out at porn star Stormy Daniels' claims that she had sex with President Trump and was threatened when she tried to take the affair public saying she had changed her story.

This sleek, parabolic panther of an aircraft boasts multiple advantages over its rivals, including softer cabin noise, larger windows, anti-turbulence technology, improved air quality and more space in every cabin.

  </div>

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">'Refreshed and raring to go': Jonathan gives the direct flight the thumbs up in Perth</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our journey itself was almost ludicrously smooth - the seatbelt sign did not flicker on even once, with the only remotely rough patch of air experienced a few hundred miles north of the Maldives, before the Dreamliner tore away across the Indian Ocean.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were some nice touches with regards to the on-board service too: every passenger's plastic water bottle was refilled, never replaced, while all of the meals had been specifically designed by chef Neil Perry, in consultation with experts from The Charles Perkins Centre at Sydney University, to stave off jetlag.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back at London Heathrow's Terminal 3, our take off had been marked in style too, with actors dressed as kangaroos and surfers, and a giant of a man playing us aboard with an enormous didgeridoo. Even our boarding passes bore the legend 'Congratulations! You are boarding the first non-stop UK-AUS flight.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Travelling in this fashion is light years ahead of the original London-Australia flight - the infamous 'Kangaroo Route' - which began in 1947. That four-day intercontinental hopscotch – involving seven stops and costing the equivalent of more than £24,000 today - has now become a seamless, non-stop 17-hour zip Down Under. (It's significantly cheaper in real terms too, with tickets for this London-Perth route starting at just £793 per person return in economy).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new route, which will now fly daily, officially becomes the longest anywhere in the world from London (a massive 24 per cent longer than the previous record holder, from Heathrow to Jakarta) and the first ever direct air connection between the continents of Europe and Australasia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There's still room for improvement of course. No Wifi on the history-making QF10 is an issue – particularly as British Airways has introduced it to many of its own long-haul flights in recent weeks. And Qantas remains agonisingly short of Qatar Airway's current world record for the longest commercial flight on Earth: 9,028 miles between Doha and Auckland.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One gets the impression that record won't stand for too long, however. Qantas already have their eyes on a non-stop London to Sydney flight by 2022, with New York-Sydney potentially coming even earlier. For now, all eyes are on the historic achievement of QF10 but ultimately, success on the London-Perth service is just the beginning.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Jonathan Thompson was challenged by Huawei to take the upcoming Huawei P20 smartphone and test its features whilst onboard.

QF9 is operated by four pilots across the 17-hour journey, with one or two pilots resting at any one time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2. The flight will follow different flight paths depending on the best winds, helping the aircraft fly faster and more efficiently. Qantas analysed a decade of seasonal wind patterns in preparation for the new service.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">3. At 14,498km, QF9 is the third longest commercial flight currently in operation. It is the world's longest Dreamliner flight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">4. QF9 will carry around 92 tonnes or 110,000 litres of fuel with the Dreamliner burning approximately 20 per cent less than traditional aircraft its size.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">5. With a total seat count of 236 passengers, the Qantas Dreamliner has significantly fewer seats than many other airlines who have configured the same aircraft to carry more than 300 passengers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">6. Currently, most aircraft have cabin air pressure equivalent to that of an altitude of 8,000 ft. For the Dreamliner, Boeing cut that down to 6,000 ft, meaning its closer to conditions on the ground.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">7. Menus for the flights between Perth and London have been designed to maintain hydration, aid sleep and reducing jetlag and including poke bowls as well as home style comfort food.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">8. There are more than 21,000 individual items loaded onto the aircraft for each flight between Perth and London including 330 peppermint tea bags and hundreds of chocolate biscuits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">9. In 1947 a return flight from Sydney to London cost £525 when the average wage was £7. Today, the average Australian weekly wage is $1600 and a return fare from Perth to London can cost less than $1300.  </p></div>                        </div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Qantas made history for the first 17-hour non-stop flight from Perth to London.

The porn star also claims a mystery man threatened her and her infant daughter in 2011 after she tried to expose her 2006 tryst with the president in a magazine interview. She made the bombshell statements on 60 Minutes on Sunday night in her highly-anticipated interview with Anderson Cooper. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has dodged questions about her relationship with the president for months since the claims came to light. But the 39-year-old adult actress finally dished on her liaison with  The Donald, including the moment Trump said she was 'special' and that she reminded her of daughter Ivanka. Reports of their illicit fling came to light in January, when it was reported that Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 to sign a non-disclosure agreement just 11 days before the 2016 presidential election. She is now suing Trump over the hush agreement and claims it is void. The president's attorneys  claim Daniels is liable for more than $20 million in damages for violations of the agreement. However, Daniels said she wanted people to know 'the truth', even if she risks a $1million fine.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Julian Robinson</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T18:55:30.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>BREAKING NEWS -Stormy Daniels reveals she had sex with Trump</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T18:55:30.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Donald Trump,Breaking News</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5542085/Melania-Trump-stay-Florida-president-flies-solo-D-C.html" title="Melania Trump to spend Sunday evening away from her husband as he flies back to DC ahead of the hotly-anticipated Stormy Daniels interview just days after the pair posed at the White House in a show of unity"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5541837/Stormy-Daniels-opens-life-growing-up.html" title="The woman who became Stormy Daniels: How she once considered becoming a journalist and spends her spare time riding horses and caring for her 7-year-old daughter"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5541137/Stormy-Daniels-says-porn-career-helped-handle-public-scrutiny.html" title="Stormy Daniels says her porn career has helped her handle public scrutiny, just one day before her anticipated 60 Minutes interview about her alleged affair with Trump"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5540167/Stormy-Daniels-lawyer-Michael-Avenetti-goes-run-client-prepares-tell-interview.html" title="Stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenetti hits Central Park for a run as his client prepares for her tell-all 60 Minutes interview "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/978034568400863238" title="Maggie Haberman on Twitter: &quot;NEWS - Trump had dinner with Michael Cohen last night.

But Trump himself, who usually likes to tweet or hold a press event for major announcements, was silent. The Kremlin reacted in kind, threatening to 'respond to every country'. Russia's ambassador to the US said the move had 'ruined what is left of Russian-US ties,' threatening Washington by saying they will bear responsibility for the consequences.

Dozens of other women came forward with similar allegations against him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'During that period of high drama and profound flux, I was especially impatient with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly for refusing to back the man who made her a star, thinking that the elegant, ambitious anchor was selfish and in it only for herself,' Rivera writes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He adds: 'A "Boycott Megyn" movement started within our ranks, with various on-air personalities muttering about how it was all part of Megyn's ongoing and ultimately successful contract negotiations, albeit at another network, NBC.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Many Fox talent loyal to Roger were vowing never to go on her Kelly File show again, and I was among them, not that I was often asked.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Without naming names, let me say that the older women at Fox were particularly vicious in their attacks on the soaring celebrity.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was later revealed that Kelly had her own accusations against Ailes, claiming that he had sexually harassed her at the start of her career at Fox.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When word spread that he had allegedly sexually bullied and come on to her at the start of her Fox career, her reluctance to back Roger vs. Gretchen's lawsuit suddenly transformed from b****y to heroic,' Rivera writes upon reflection, calling Kelly's allegation the 'most explosive' of them all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the Ailes scandal wasn't the only time that Rivera questioned Kelly's motives - he also refused to back her when she questioned then-presidential candidate Trump's behavior toward women in 2015.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

The Legislature is scheduled to end its session in mid-April but has run long in recent years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The checks are widely seen as an entitlement - discretionary money for many Alaskans but critical income for others, particularly lower-income residents living in high-cost rural communities where a gallon of milk can cost about $10.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The decision, first by Walker, then by lawmakers, to not follow the formula in law for dividend calculations the past two years has fueled anger and distrust among some Alaskans who fear a money grab, even as state leaders say they're motivated by a desire to protect a dividend into the future.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style"><div>  <div class="image-wrap">

In the phone calls they have had since Porter left, the pair have reportedly discussed trade and the China tariff's Trump announced last week. A White House official, speaking on background, said Trump misses the staff structure that Porter helped organize. Porter was dating former White House communications director Hope Hicks (top) when the abuse revelations surfaced. </dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Emily Crane</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T02:38:00.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Trump is 'considering bringing back Rob Porter' after resignation</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T02:38:00.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Breaking News,Donald Trump</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content></item><item><title>Billionaire Elon Musk's father, 72, claims baby he had with his own step-daughter, 30, was the result of a 'one off mistake' when she split up with her boyfriend and turned to him for comfort </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5542057/Elon-Musks-father-claims-baby-step-daughter-result-one-mistake.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Mar 2018 17:49:52 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5542057</guid><description><![CDATA[The baby he fathered by his own step-daughter was as the result of a one-off ‘mistake’, Errol Musk – the South African father of the tech billionaire Elon Musk, has revealed.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

In the harrowing video, people react in panic and begin to flee when the roof appears to collapse and the inferno rages at the Kemerovo shopping centre. It comes as the MP for Siberian city - Anton Gorelkin, who is a member of the pro-Putin United Russia party - accused the city's deputy mayor of having 'his eyes closed by money' when the mall was opened in 2013. He added that the complex had been built from 's*** and sticks: Cheap plastic, a labyrinth of corridors and a hellish mess of ownership documents.' Four people have been detained, but officials have not yet confirmed the cause of the fire. Meanwhile, the country's anti-corruption Investigative Committee revealed that a security guard switched off the fire alarm at the mall when he was told a blaze at broken out. The  official death toll from the inferno is 64. Top right: Mourners outside the mall today.

The Queensland MP compared the 'genocide' of murdered farmers to the Holocaust and branded the black thugs responsible for the killings 'subhuman'. 'Anyone who would boil a child in a bath, rape his mother and slaughter people the way they are slaughtering them now are subhuman,' he said. Senator Anning then claimed South Africa would need Australian foreign aid after black people took over the farms and Julie Bishop would hand it over 'like a drunken sailor'.

He works hard, but he doesn't earn very much money.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed Ant and his father's lives are worlds apart.

Engineering works will hit major train routes across the UK including the west coast main line, London and East Anglia, while Northern, South Western Railway and the Docklands Light Railway could all be hit by strike action. Journeys on motorways could take up to 90 minutes longer on Maundy Thursday, with the M25 around the capital expected to be worst hit between 4pm and 6pm, while delays are also expected on the M1, M4, M5 and M6.

He shot his ex-girlfriend, Jaelynn Willey (inset), 16, in the head. The bullet traveled through her and hit another classmate, Desmond Barnes, 14, in the thigh. Willey died two days later in the ICU while Barnes is expected to make a full recovery.  It was previously unclear if the deputy's shot was what killed Rollins. He was able to get to the 17-year-old one minute after he opened fire in the school. The handgun Rollins used was his father's.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>AP</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Wires</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T10:50:14.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Shooter at Maryland high school killed himself, the sheriff revealed</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T10:50:14.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5547535/Eagles-Death-Metal-singer-lashes-March-Lives-supporters.html" title="Eagles of Death Metal singer and Bataclan attack survivor Jesse Hughes calls March for Our Lives 'pathetic' and says the students who lived through the Parkland shooting are 'vile abusers of the dead'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5546605/Grandmother-slain-Sacramento-man-calls-police-changes.html" title="'Why didn't they shoot him in the arm, or send a taser?'

The rape led to her decline which included bullying, physical abuse, meth addiction and three attempts at suicide (pictured right during years of using ice). Sneaking out of her rural home in South Canterbury, the opportunistic teenager decided to ditch her warm bed at 1am and head out to drink with some friends. Fifteen years later Rach is unable to shake the memories from the night that she was raped.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Roger Byrom</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T03:55:50.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>How a young mother addicted to ice kicked the habit</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T03:55:50.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4434404/Heartbreaking-video-reveals-struggles-suicide-letters.html" title="Dear suicidal me...: Poignant video shows people reading out their own suicide notes to prove there IS a way back from utter despair"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4928440/Girl-29-adicted-self-harm-10-years-speaks-out.html" title="'There is a life beyond your scars': Woman, 29, who was addicted to self-harm for 10 years speaks out after it nearly claimed her life"></link></item><item><title>Lone wildebeest is hunted down and killed in a muddy African river by a pack of four determined lionesses</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5544759/Lionesses-hunt-kill-lone-wildebeest-South-Africa.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 11:27:05 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5544759</guid><description><![CDATA[Stalked, chased across the Savannah, and finally brought down in a riverbed, the lone wildebeest had no chance against a snarling pack of hungry lionesses in a South African park.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

That inspired them to reach out to Department of Defense officials the next year to propose a partnership to find the missing. It would become the university's Missing in Action Recovery and Identification Project.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was good timing. After being criticized for years for failing to recover and identify more remains of U.S. service members, the Defense Department unveiled a revamped agency called Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More than 82,000 Americans remain missing from conflicts since World War II - nearly 73,000 of them from that war.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Military officials combed through hundreds of cases. They settled on looking for Fazekas, because the statements of Cooche and the wingman pointed to a specific location. Scouts were deployed to France to inspect the crash site and talk with Cooche.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the next spring, just a few months before excavation was to start, ground penetrating radar found no sign of the crash.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We were frantic, we were very frantic because we put a lot of time into this case,' says Charles Konsitzke, facilitator of the project.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A few days later Department of Defense officials searching the archives found aerial images of the area taken two days after the crash. Konsitzke took the image and overlaid it with a current aerial photo - and they found the exact location.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style"><div>  <div class="image-wrap">

They ended up going twice to the site, in 2016 and 2017, digging a 10- to 15-foot deep hole in the hard clay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They found six machine guns. They found the plane's engine. And they found some bones of Frank Fazekas Sr., and his dog tags.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They had a special visitor during the 2016 dig. Frank Fazekas Jr. felt like he was pulled to the site, for his mother: 'I feel like I am like completing a story for them.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They gave him a pair of gloves to help out. As the hours passed, he found a piece of the dash board, part of a starter switch, a green plastic cover for the landing gear indicators. He used a wire brush to clean off the mud from the starter motor. He kept some items, including a black rubber piece that may have come off the control stick.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I thought that might be something my father actually held on to,' he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also met the man who was present for his father's last moments: Marc Cooche, who still lived 300 yards from the crash site.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Through an interpreter, they discussed what happened the day of the crash. Until then, Fazekas only knew the wingman's account. But Cooche told Fazekas what he saw, that his father may have tried to maintain control until the end, that he may still have been alive when he crashed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were many hugs. Fazekas gave the witness a small model of his father's plane.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It was like family, almost,' Fazekas says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On May 8 - the 73rd anniversary of the end of the war in Europe - Buysscheure will pay tribute to an airman whose remains had rested within its boundaries, unheralded, for almost three quarters of a century. The building that houses a library, performance room and school will be renamed the Frank Fazekas Cultural Center, and a plaque with his name will be added to the monument to local war dead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fazekas, his wife and some university officials plan to return for the festivities.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cooche also will be there. He remains grateful to the Americans for liberating his country.

Frank Fazekas was flying a P-47 Thunderbolt (file picture, inset) when it came down on a French farm 20 miles from the English Channel after being hit by German fire in May 1944. For years, the 22-year-old's family believed he was buried at the Ardennes American Cemetery in Belgium. But all that changed when his New Jersey son, Frank Fazekas Jr. (top right next to a picture of his father), who was just six months old at the time of the air crash, was informed about a possible discovery. In 2016, he traveled to France and helped out as experts excavated the crash site (left and bottom right) and found the remains of the hero pilot.

Trevor Cadigan, Daniel Thompson, 34, 29-year-old Tristan Hill, Carla Vallejos Blanco, 29, and Brian McDaniel were all killed in the March 11 crash. Vance, who was not wearing a harness, escaped with only minor injuries.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>AP</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Wires</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T10:45:06.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Pilot in NYC copter crash blames passenger restraint harness</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T10:45:06.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>New York</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5547963/Car-crash-sends-two-year-old-boy-flying-rear-window.html" title="Shocking moment car crash sends two-year-old boy flying through rear window and across road - but somehow he avoids serious injury"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5547403/Male-cyclist-dies-hit-outside-Sydneys-Centennial-Park.html" title="Male cyclist, in his 20s, dies in hospital after being run over by a car outside of Sydney's Centennial Park"></link></item><item><title>Don't mess with my Mum!

Many saw this as a vindictive act of class warfare by Labour minister of fuel and power, Manny Shinwell.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 8th Earl Fitzwilliam died in a plane crash in 1948 along with Marchioness of Hartington, the younger sister of John F Kennedy. He left no male heir.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the death of the 8th Earl the house began to decline. A sale of valuables at the time included 14 four-poster beds. It was later used as a teacher training college.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Fitzwilliam family ended its connection with the house in 1979, with the death of the 10th and last Earl. The house and 83 acres were sold to a private buyer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The sale did not include the deer park, the rest of the estate and the nearby Wentworth village, which were placed in a charitable trust. The estate, which features a range of listed follies including the 90ft high Rockingham Monument and 100ft high Hoober Stand, continues to be run by the Fitzwilliam Wentworth Amenity Trust.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 1999 architectural historian John Martin Robinson wrote that 'the failure of Wentworth Woodhouse to become a stately home open to the public after the Second World War and thus to have secured its future like Chatsworth or Woburn is an architectural tragedy'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The house was bought by architect Clifford Newbold in 1999 who hoped a huge legal claim against the Coal Authority for mining damage would help him restore the house. But this failed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The house was bought by the Wentworth Woodhouse Preservation Trust in 2017, partly funded by a £3.5 million grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As well as the vast mansion, the trust bought 83 acres of land immediately around it; the stable block, which is almost as large as the house; and a range of other buildings, including the huge, derelict Camelia House.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wentworth Woodhouse is regularly used as a film location - appearing as Buckingham Palace in the recent hit movie Darkest Hour and also in the BBC drama Victoria. </p></div>                        </div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>It is a year since the Wentworth Woodhouse (interior pictured bottom ), hidden in the South Yorkshire countryside just outside Rotherham, was bought by the Wentworth Woodhouse Preservation Trust for £7 million. This modest purchase price - the cost of a flat in parts of central London - is just the beginning of a mammoth investment needed by the trust as it works to reverse decades of decay. Trust chief executive Sarah McLeod believes that the total bill could be between £150 and £200 million. This is because the task she faces is epic. Wentworth Woodhouse's 606ft facade (pictured centre) is wider than Buckingham Palace - a building it stood in for during the filming of Oscar-nominated movie Darkest Hour - and its floor area is about the same as the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Alex Green</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T14:04:32.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Mansion with 600ft-wide facade set for £200M renovation</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T14:04:32.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5542143/Wayne-Coleen-Rooneys-luxurious-20m-custom-built-mansion-Cheshire-takes-shape.html" title="Wayne's OTHER manor: Rooney's monster £20MILLION home complete with football pitch, wine cellar and fishing lakes takes shape as he prepares to move his family in from £6m Cheshire pad"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5540149/British-state-school-troublemakers-attend-Indias-Eton-learn-hard-lessons.html" title="Unique TV experiment sends five British state school troublemakers to 'India's Eton' to learn some VERY hard lessons "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5541163/President-Trumps-older-sister-selling-eight-bedroom-beachfront-home-Florida-23M.html" title="Good deals run in the family!

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The far-flung investigation that led to Moorcones' door began in Switzerland in August of 2015, when a postal inspector there randomly pulled a package and found it was filled with small vials.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The package was shipped from Arizona under the name of 'Thomas Mann', and was found to contain elite performance-enhancing substances. Swiss authorities alerted the US Anti-Doping Agency, which said it had never heard of Mann.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Months later, Mann's name surfaced again, in an <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://youtu.be/wJRPxmTuxoI">Al-Jazeera documentary</a> about sports doping. Underground chemists interviewed for the film spoke of Mann reverently, as a shadowy genius known for his high-quality wares. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Federal investigators tied Mann to the web forum DatBTrue, which was dedicated to discussing advances in peptides.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This wasn't 'bro science'; he is a pure brainiac,' former professional sprinter and customer Cory Bidlow told the Times. 'He would post scientific studies breaking down how a peptide worked.' Bidlow drew a four-year suspension for using Mann's peptides. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When commenters on the forum asked about inquiring peptides, Mann used another pseudonym to steer their business his way. He strictly vetted potential clients and insisted that his products were for laboratory use only - if a customer even mentioned using the peptides for illegal purposes, he'd ban them immediately, customers said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A painstaking federal investigation managed to track down Mann using informants, emails, shipping receipts, surveillance footage and more.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mann was actually Moorcones, investigators told the Times. He shipped the products from a UPS store in a strip mall near his home, often bringing his septuagenarian parents along.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">
