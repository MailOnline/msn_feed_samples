And that's not good news for Honda.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">NSX is a name that carries serious weight, thanks to the original Honda supercar that went out of production 13 years ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But while Honda's been out of the performance-car game  - instead developing new ways  to transport potted plants in a Jazz - the established marques have been blitzing the market with new machinery, expanding their supercar expertise and scrambling over each other for the biggest chunk of what is a pretty limited clientele.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But despite this Honda's having no problems with sales. In fact, it claims it can't make the NSX quick enough to appease  demand - even here in the UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first allocation of 100 cars sold out within a year of becoming available, and most of the second allocation - due to arrive this summer - have been snapped up by fanboys (and girls) already, with the waiting list currently standing at 12 months if you put a request in today.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fortunately, three cars - at the time of this test - have been allocated to the press fleet (one being in the workshop having been rudely vandalised with an unsightly diagram on the bonnet), so I didn't have long to wait to get my hands on one, with this review coinciding nicely with the 2018 Formula One season opener in Australia at the weekend.</p><div class="mol-img-group xwArtSplitter">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

Downsized engines, hybrid powertrains, regenerative power systems - they really are testing the boundaries of the technology that governments will force all motorists to use in the next few years. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the Honda NSX shares more ingredients with F1 cars of 2018 than any other thrill-seeking model on the market. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here's my argument. Like the Formula One prototypes, it uses a turbocharged V6 petrol engine. However, at 3.5 litres, it's more than twice the size of the 1600cc capacity motors used by Red Bull Racing, Force India and the rest. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just like high-profile names such as Alonso, Raikonnen and Verstappen, NSX drivers will have the motor wedged just inches from their ear, with the six-cylinder lump dropped as close to the centre of the car as possible, just behind the backrest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Honda has also decided to follow the footsteps of F1 into the fiendishly complicated world of electrified hybrid performance, while the supercar fraternity has tended to play it safe with conventional petrol-only powerplants.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it hasn't scrimped on the supplementary kilowatts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are two electric motors up front - one powering each of the front wheels - and a third bolted between the engine and the nine-speed transmission, which is one gear more than F1 rules stipulate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's not short of power as a result. With 573bhp when all power sources are active, it's more potent than a Lamborghini Huracan or Porsche 911 Turbo S.</p><div class="mol-img-group xwArtSplitter">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

Then it has to choose which of the front motors needs to work at what speed, how the traction control kicks in, if the inside wheels need some braking applied to make the car pivot quicker, and how much power is sent to each corner of the car - all in a bid to take a bend as fast as physics allow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That's no small achievement. Think of it as like deciding what to have for dinner tonight, but in the same millisecond working out what ingredients you need, how they need to be prepped, the optimum cooking temperature, what has to be readied first and how you're going to present it on a plate, while actually doing that all at the same time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fortunately, the system is so seamless that you'll never need to know any of this... </p><div class="mol-img-group xwArtSplitter">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

Okay, it's fitted with £8,400 optional carbon ceramic brakes, but they're linked to a regenerative energy system to replenish the small battery for the electric motors - and if you've ever driven a Toyota Prius, you'll know that this can make the stop pedal turn into a Victoria Sponge. Not in the NSX. It's sharp and full of feel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But that's not the most impressive characteristic of the hyper-powered Honda.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What's more flabbergasting is how it holds a corner at speed without a stutter or hint of struggle. You won't know it but the onboard computer is working tirelessly in the background, as it calculates how to handle that fast-approaching curve and deposit you safely at the other end. And all the while it doesn't feel synthetic or aided. In fact, it feels mechanical and hugely involving.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While it almost certainly never is the case, you, the driver, feel utterly responsible for each perfectly taken turn, and that's a bigger testament to Honda than the cornering speed itself.</p><div class="mol-img-group xwArtSplitter">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

Tuned on silky US highways, you'll feel just about every foible in the British tarmac </p></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">It's flawless then, right?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unfortunately, it's not quite the finished article, for three main reasons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Firstly, the ride is punishing, even by supercar standards. This is mostly due to the suspension compliance being mastered on US roads (where it's called the Acura NSX) and therefore far too rigid for the UK's pothole-riddled routes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The next issue is the dinky 1.3 kilowatt battery for the three electrified motors. It simply doesn't provide  electric power for long enough installments. This might sounds like a moot point for a near-600bhp powerhouse designed to tear up tarmac rather than glide over it mutely, but there's no denying that it impresses when cruised silently through town as much as it does when you're rampaging through the countryside.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The final flaw is the interior. Has it been lifted from a £20,000 Civic hatchback? Not entirely, but that infotainment system certainly has, and it's way too crude for a car that is a mechanical masterpiece. If it was my £180,000, I'd feel short-changed by the cabin finish.</p><div class="mol-img-group xwArtSplitter"><div class="splitLeft"><div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

Used to describe just about any new model with more horse power than the Grand National and a price that's on a par with a modest-sized property, it's an easy link to make. But Honda's NSX really is the closest thing to the current F1 cars you can have on the road today. Powered by a hybrid V6 engine, as an F1 car is, it's one of few supercars to adopt electric power. So, what's it like to drive? We spent a week with one to find out.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Rob Hull</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T17:53:29.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>We drive Honda's F1 car for the road - the £150k NSX supercar</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T17:53:29.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/cars/article-5491861/How-super-rich-finance-supercars.html" title="A £600,000 deposit, monthly payments of £26,000 and £1.8M to pay at the end - how the mega-rich finance the most exclusive supercars"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/cars/article-5504899/Honda-making-135mph-lawnmower.html" title="Honda reveals its new model that produces 189bhp and has a top speed of 135mph - and it's a LAWNMOWER"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/cars/article-5495633/This-Range-Rover-sets-record-time-deadly-mountain-road-China.html" title="The Range Rover that's faster than a supercar: 4x4 obliterates the record time set by a Ferrari for racing up one of the deadliest roads known to man"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/cars/article-5483187/Morgans-144-000-Aero-GT-revealed-Geneva-Motor-Show.html" title="Cheerio old chap!
