Engineering works will hit major train routes across the UK including the west coast main line, London and East Anglia, while Northern, South Western Railway and the Docklands Light Railway could all be hit by strike action. Journeys on motorways could take up to 90 minutes longer on Maundy Thursday, with the M25 around the capital expected to be worst hit between 4pm and 6pm, while delays are also expected on the M1, M4, M5 and M6. The Met Office has warned temperatures will get 'increasingly colder' in the UK later this week, dropping as low as -5C (23F) overnight, while northern and central areas could have snow on Good Friday and Saturday.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Mark Duell</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T17:16:10.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Easter travel chaos fears amid 'Beast from the East Mark 3'</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T17:16:10.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>UK Weather,Met Office</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5542637/Christmas-turkeys-crackers-wreaths-sold-Easter-alternatives-UK-shops.html" title="We wish you a merry...EASTER: It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas as shops sell crackers, wreaths and turkeys "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5539231/Britain-braced-white-Easter-snow-way.html" title="Brace for a white Easter: Forecasters warn an arctic blast from Scandinavia could send temperatures plummeting over the holiday weekend with snow possible"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-5544015/Rail-workers-solidly-supporting-strike-dispute-guards.html" title="Rail workers `solidly supporting´ strike in dispute over guards"></link></item><item><title>Dynamo reveals the shocking impact of his Crohn's disease by sharing an almost unrecognisable photo of his swollen face with his fans</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5546433/Dynamo-reveals-shocking-impact-Crohns-disease.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 19:16:15 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5546433</guid><description><![CDATA[Dynamo looked almost unrecognisable after revealing the impact of his Crohn's disease by sharing a picture of his swollen face.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">'Refreshed and raring to go': Jonathan gives the direct flight the thumbs up in Perth</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our journey itself was almost ludicrously smooth - the seatbelt sign did not flicker on even once, with the only remotely rough patch of air experienced a few hundred miles north of the Maldives, before the Dreamliner tore away across the Indian Ocean.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were some nice touches with regards to the on-board service too: every passenger's plastic water bottle was refilled, never replaced, while all of the meals had been specifically designed by chef Neil Perry, in consultation with experts from The Charles Perkins Centre at Sydney University, to stave off jetlag.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back at London Heathrow's Terminal 3, our take off had been marked in style too, with actors dressed as kangaroos and surfers, and a giant of a man playing us aboard with an enormous didgeridoo. Even our boarding passes bore the legend 'Congratulations! You are boarding the first non-stop UK-AUS flight.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Travelling in this fashion is light years ahead of the original London-Australia flight - the infamous 'Kangaroo Route' - which began in 1947. That four-day intercontinental hopscotch – involving seven stops and costing the equivalent of more than £24,000 today - has now become a seamless, non-stop 17-hour zip Down Under. (It's significantly cheaper in real terms too, with tickets for this London-Perth route starting at just £793 per person return in economy).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new route, which will now fly daily, officially becomes the longest anywhere in the world from London (a massive 24 per cent longer than the previous record holder, from Heathrow to Jakarta) and the first ever direct air connection between the continents of Europe and Australasia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There's still room for improvement of course. No Wifi on the history-making QF10 is an issue – particularly as British Airways has introduced it to many of its own long-haul flights in recent weeks. And Qantas remains agonisingly short of Qatar Airway's current world record for the longest commercial flight on Earth: 9,028 miles between Doha and Auckland.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One gets the impression that record won't stand for too long, however. Qantas already have their eyes on a non-stop London to Sydney flight by 2022, with New York-Sydney potentially coming even earlier. For now, all eyes are on the historic achievement of QF10 but ultimately, success on the London-Perth service is just the beginning.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Jonathan Thompson was challenged by Huawei to take the upcoming Huawei P20 smartphone and test its features whilst onboard.

QF9 is operated by four pilots across the 17-hour journey, with one or two pilots resting at any one time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2. The flight will follow different flight paths depending on the best winds, helping the aircraft fly faster and more efficiently. Qantas analysed a decade of seasonal wind patterns in preparation for the new service.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">3. At 14,498km, QF9 is the third longest commercial flight currently in operation. It is the world's longest Dreamliner flight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">4. QF9 will carry around 92 tonnes or 110,000 litres of fuel with the Dreamliner burning approximately 20 per cent less than traditional aircraft its size.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">5. With a total seat count of 236 passengers, the Qantas Dreamliner has significantly fewer seats than many other airlines who have configured the same aircraft to carry more than 300 passengers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">6. Currently, most aircraft have cabin air pressure equivalent to that of an altitude of 8,000 ft. For the Dreamliner, Boeing cut that down to 6,000 ft, meaning its closer to conditions on the ground.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">7. Menus for the flights between Perth and London have been designed to maintain hydration, aid sleep and reducing jetlag and including poke bowls as well as home style comfort food.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">8. There are more than 21,000 individual items loaded onto the aircraft for each flight between Perth and London including 330 peppermint tea bags and hundreds of chocolate biscuits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">9. In 1947 a return flight from Sydney to London cost £525 when the average wage was £7. Today, the average Australian weekly wage is $1600 and a return fare from Perth to London can cost less than $1300.  </p></div>                        </div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Qantas made history for the first 17-hour non-stop flight from Perth to London.

The US has announced the expulsion of 60 Russians, including including 12 intelligence officers from Russia's mission to UN headquarters in New York (pictured alongside Russia's French, Polish and German embassies). But Trump himself, who usually likes to tweet or hold a press event for major announcements, was silent. The Kremlin reacted in kind, threatening to 'respond to every country'. Russia's ambassador to the US said the move had 'ruined what is left of Russian-US ties,' threatening Washington by saying they will bear responsibility for the consequences. Peskov added the Foreign Ministry will analyze the situation and present a proposal to Putin (pictured inset) - who will make the ultimate decision on how to respond.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Timothy Sculthorpe</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T10:37:33.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>US and 22 other states expel Kremlin spies</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T10:37:33.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>European Union,Theresa May,Russia</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5545667/Social-media-spat-erupts-diplomat-expulsions.html" title="It’s Twitter war!

The inquiry in the disappearance of Mr McKeague (left) will be stood down and passed to a cold case team amid mounting costs and a lack of leads, it is reported. Mr McKeague was 23 when he was last seen walking through Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in September 2016 after a night out with friends. Police conducted two searches of a landfill site near Cambridge last year, with the first search lasting 20 weeks and the second concluding in December. Mr McKeague's father Martin (inset) said he fears the airman may have killed himself. Martin, 49, said he thought his son knew he was going to become a father (shown right, his son and girlfriend April, right) which may have affected his mental state.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>PA</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Wires</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T16:17:08.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Corrie McKeague probe shelved by police and passed to cold case team</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T16:17:08.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5543233/Paralysed-Manchester-Arena-attack-victim-regains-movement-legs.html" title="Father who was paralysed by Manchester bomb attack and told he would never walk again regains the feeling in his legs just HOURS after starting pioneering treatment"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5543061/Study-reveals-red-hot-names-1918-VANISHED-century-later.html" title="From Abe to Yolanda... study reveals the red-hot names of 1918 that have all but VANISHED a century later "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dad-missing-corrie-mckeague-suggests-12251623" title="Dad of missing Corrie McKeague suggests RAF gunner son may have killed himself - Mirror Online"></link></item><item><title>Hundreds gather outside Parliament to back Jewish leaders' condemnation of Corbyn over anti-Semitism as Labour's leader admits it is a bigger problem than a 'few bad apples'</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5543157/Jewish-leaders-accuse-Jeremy-Corbyn-treating-hostile-entity.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 00:22:32 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5543157</guid><description><![CDATA[Jonathan Goldstein, the Chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council, told the huge crowd gathered opposite Parliament the Labour leader must do more to stamp out anti-Semitism inside his party.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Lesley Speed, 44, (left) strangled Archie Spriggs (right) with a scarf before smothering him with a cushion on the day she and her ex Matthew Spriggs were due at a family court. Just one week before Archie was found dead, Speed wrote a chilling letter to Mr Spriggs, telling him: 'I hope this pain lives with you until your dying breath.' Archie was found dead on his bunk bed by Speed's partner Darren Jones at their home in Church Stretton, Shropshire, on September 21 (inset). Mr Justice Nicol, adjourning proceedings, said he would sentence Speed on Tuesday.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Abe Hawken</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T19:08:31.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Mother, 44, is found guilty of strangling and smothering her son</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T19:08:31.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5544155/Estranged-father-walked-Ant-McPartlin-ten-years-old.html" title="EXCLUSIVE: Ant McPartlin's estranged father - who walked out on his £60m TV star son when he was 10 - now earns £15-an-hour as a gas pipe fitter and lives in a two-bed council house "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5544499/Businessman-killed-13-year-old-boy-Ferrari-jailed-18-months.html" title="'You were showing off': Judge slams businessman who killed boy, 13, by flipping £1.2m Ferrari as he took him for a spin with neither wearing a seatbelt and jails him for 18 months "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/crime/2018/03/26/you-should-never-have-to-bury-your-own-child-archie-spriggs-dad-tells-of-his-devastation/" title="'You should never have to bury your own child': Archie Spriggs' dad tells of his devastation | Shropshire Star"></link></item><item><title>Owners of rogue wedding boutique which promised 'bespoke' gowns but ruined brides' big days with 'Made in China' dresses avoid jail over £12,000 con</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5545795/Owners-rogue-wedding-boutique-avoid-jail-12-000-con.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 15:57:02 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5545795</guid><description><![CDATA[Bridal boutique owner Melanie Bishop, 36, and her mother Patricia, 60, of Oakdale, Caerphilly, tricked 13 brides into thinking they were buying bespoke gowns for their big day.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Some supporters even donned Sonny Bill masks at matches and Warner had an amazing off-field bust up with South Africa's Quinton de Kock after he allegedly brought up his wife's past.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Martin Robinson</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T21:21:21.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Aussie cricketer's partner slams ex-England captain Michael Vaughan</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T21:21:21.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>South Africa,England Cricket</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5544051/Sydney-regret-tattoos-spelling-love-cricket-Australian-ball-tampering-scandal.html" title="Tats awkward!

The porn star also claims a mystery man threatened her and her infant daughter in 2011 after she tried to expose her 2006 tryst with the president in a magazine interview. She made the bombshell statements on 60 Minutes on Sunday night in her highly-anticipated interview with Anderson Cooper. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has dodged questions about her relationship with the president for months since the claims came to light. But the 39-year-old adult actress finally dished on her liaison with  The Donald, including the moment Trump said she was 'special' and that she reminded her of daughter Ivanka. Reports of their illicit fling came to light in January, when it was reported that Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 to sign a non-disclosure agreement just 11 days before the 2016 presidential election. She is now suing Trump over the hush agreement and claims it is void. The president's attorneys  claim Daniels is liable for more than $20 million in damages for violations of the agreement. However, Daniels said she wanted people to know 'the truth', even if she risks a $1million fine.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Julian Robinson</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T18:55:30.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>BREAKING NEWS -Stormy Daniels reveals she had sex with Trump</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T18:55:30.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Donald Trump,Breaking News</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5542085/Melania-Trump-stay-Florida-president-flies-solo-D-C.html" title="Melania Trump to spend Sunday evening away from her husband as he flies back to DC ahead of the hotly-anticipated Stormy Daniels interview just days after the pair posed at the White House in a show of unity"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5541837/Stormy-Daniels-opens-life-growing-up.html" title="The woman who became Stormy Daniels: How she once considered becoming a journalist and spends her spare time riding horses and caring for her 7-year-old daughter"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5541137/Stormy-Daniels-says-porn-career-helped-handle-public-scrutiny.html" title="Stormy Daniels says her porn career has helped her handle public scrutiny, just one day before her anticipated 60 Minutes interview about her alleged affair with Trump"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5540167/Stormy-Daniels-lawyer-Michael-Avenetti-goes-run-client-prepares-tell-interview.html" title="Stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenetti hits Central Park for a run as his client prepares for her tell-all 60 Minutes interview "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/978034568400863238" title="Maggie Haberman on Twitter: &quot;NEWS - Trump had dinner with Michael Cohen last night.

In the harrowing video, people react in panic and begin to flee when the roof appears to collapse and the inferno rages at the Kemerovo shopping centre. It comes as the MP for Siberian city - Anton Gorelkin, who is a member of the pro-Putin United Russia party - accused the city's deputy mayor of having 'his eyes closed by money' when the mall was opened in 2013. He added that the complex had been built from 's*** and sticks: Cheap plastic, a labyrinth of corridors and a hellish mess of ownership documents.' Four people have been detained, but officials have not yet confirmed the cause of the fire. Meanwhile, the country's anti-corruption Investigative Committee revealed that a security guard switched off the fire alarm at the mall when he was told a blaze at broken out. The  official death toll from the inferno is 64. Top right: Mourners outside the mall today.

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Tom Marcus revealed that a Russian agent was deported after he was caught with sensitive documents down his pants</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/russia/index.html">Russian </a>spies are the very best, which is why I used to love working against them when I was a deep-cover MI5 officer and surveillance expert. They truly understood how to operate on foreign soil as, under the guise of being diplomats, they operated out of the Russian Embassy in Kensington Palace Gardens.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They would hardly ever try to recruit members of the British Parliament because they knew the risks of being caught were incredibly high. Most of the time they were here to advance their country’s technical or military progress by targeting our defence companies and tech firms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I grudgingly admired them, because despite them trying to undermine this country, they would do it in a way that was subtle. Stealing secrets with a feather, that’s how the Russians generally did it. No sledgehammers involved — unless it was a reprisal on one of their own defecting agents (as we now know only too well with the nerve-gas attack on double-agent Sergei Skripal).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back in 2012, I’d been on this particular job for weeks, one of a team keeping surveillance on a Russian — codenamed Dirty Boot — every time his S-Class Mercedes with diplomatic plates left the Embassy. Then our main attention switched to his new contact: a tall, blonde-haired woman in her early 20s he’d recruited and was priming to spy for him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was a receptionist at an office of executive suites at Farnborough in Hampshire, just a stone’s throw from the premises of a top-secret tech company that specialised in satellite imagery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was vulnerable and was tempted. She’d left university with massive debts and had tried to supplement her income by taking on dodgy escort work. He drew her into his clutches by offering her a way out. He also promised her a new identity, a paid-for home and a job with the ministry in Moscow if she helped him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On his instructions, she started up a passionate love affair with a particular engineer on the satellite project at the nearby tech company. He was flattered by her attentions, fell into her arms and their pillow talk produced information about his sensitive work on lasers and the means to hack into his emails, text messages and voicemail.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

No sledgehammers involved — unless it was a reprisal on one of their own defecting agents (as we now know only too well with the nerve-gas attack on double-agent Sergei Skripal)</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’d planted eavesdropping equipment in her flat and at the engineer’s house and knew that he was unwittingly revealing enough about the top-secret technology he was working on for the Russians to replicate it back in Moscow and advance their country’s technology research and development by at least 30 years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was in my car keeping watch at Farnborough airport for Hungry Worm, our codename for the blonde. I had to be careful because, though it was unlikely that her Russian handler had given her any anti-surveillance training, I couldn’t follow her directly out of the car park if she left the building.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was bound to be wary, given the furtive nature of what she was up to, and she might suspect something wasn’t quite right even if she wasn’t experienced enough to identify exactly what was wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Word came through on the radio. There’d been a tip that the Russian was planning a meeting with Hungry Worm, probably so she could hand over secret documents she’d managed to get her hands on from her boyfriend.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But no one on our side knew where it was to be. He’d apparently left the details of where and when at a florist’s shop. ‘We don’t have any further intelligence, just a heads-up that it’s going to take place.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She had obviously been told not to use her mobile phone to text him, hence we had no electronic intercepts to go on. Nor could we send an agent into the flower shop to see what the message was, just in case the florist was a Russian recruit, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But we desperately needed to monitor that meeting — and, if possible, photograph it — if we were to gather the proof to present to the Russian Embassy and kick this guy out of the country for trying to steal our technology. The problem was we had absolutely no idea where it was to be held.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I watched as a white courier van pulled up outside the executive suite where the blonde worked and a woman got out with flowers and took them inside to deliver. Van and driver then left. I saw the blonde leave the building and head off to a bus stop on the main road. There she got on a nearly empty number 82 bus.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We couldn’t send someone to follow her on board. That would be too much of a giveaway. Cars would tail the bus, but still risked being spotted, if not by her then by Russian counter-surveillance who might have been tracking her movements.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And what if she gave us the slip? We had to find out where she was going. I decided to act on my own initiative rather than await orders.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Though it risked compromising the whole operation if I was spotted, I walked into the reception area of the executive suite. A fresh bunch of flowers was on the front desk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trying to appear as if I was just waiting for someone, I strained to see the greeting card on the flowers. The message was upside-down but I managed to make out the words: ‘My beautiful lady, meet you same time at the Crescent.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I turned away, spun an impromptu yarn to a security guard who’d asked me my business and left the building. Back in my car, I phoned in to base to give them the message.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <div><div> <span></span> <div></div></div></div><p class="imageCaption">They would hardly ever try to recruit members of the British Parliament because they knew the risks of being caught were incredibly high</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was enough for the boys there to rapidly check this new information against the pair’s known meeting places. The word came back: ‘Meeting place between Dirty Boot and Hungry Worm is believed to be at the RHS [Royal Horticultural Society] garden in Wisley, specifically the glasshouse.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The radio net was now buzzing as everyone swung into action and reported in. ‘Hungry Worm is off the bus,’ said a message from the surveillance team covering the blonde. Apparently she was waiting by the side of the road.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then: ‘Stand by! Stand by! Dirty Boot is in a black taxi and pulling alongside her.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This could be a calamity. The danger was that the Russian was on to us and had been following us as we tracked her movements. Was he now warning her off?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But we need not have worried. The blonde got into the taxi with the Russian and together they sped off.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The whole team was directed to get to Wisley in Surrey as fast as possible, but without being seen. With Russian targets, you need to remain in the shadows or they will rumble you. We couldn’t follow the taxi directly or overtake it without the risk of blowing our cover.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Getting ahead of them meant a hair-raising drive at top speed through side-streets and back routes. Overtaking anything in our path at 140mph, we set off a speed camera, but things like that don’t bother us. Fines, parking tickets and London congestion charges get paid by the service.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And we made it. We got to Wisley ahead of the taxi and were in position with cameras to snap it when it arrived. Another of the team was already on foot inside the gardens, taking pictures of the plant life with a long lens.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was good cover. One woman in her late 40s apparently photographing flowers could get a crystal-clear image of both targets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I sat in my car outside and waited. Suddenly the radio sprang to life again. ‘Black cab heading towards Wisley entrance.’ Followed by: ‘Dirty Boot and Hungry Worm now out and walking arm in arm towards the main building.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nobody else went inside the gardens, which was wise. If we’d flooded the place with agents, they would have stuck out like a sore thumb.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We hid ourselves around the area, using cars and buildings for cover.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The controller kept us up to date with a running commentary on what was going on in the glasshouse. ‘Hungry Worm has shown Dirty Boot a brown paper folder. Dirty Boot looked at the contents but did not take anything out. The folder is still with Hungry Worm. She put it into her handbag.’ I had to admire this. By leaving the folder with the blonde, the Russian handler technically hadn’t stolen state secrets. He was making sure he and Russia kept their distance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Either this was because he’d spotted us or, more likely that he was instinctively providing himself with an extra layer of operational security. His plan was to receive the actual documents at a later date and was merely checking them. Bloody hell, these Russians are good.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And then in a flash the secret rendezvous in the gardens was over. The Russian headed towards the exit, where the taxi they’d come in was waiting in the car park. He got in and it drove off, with him staring rather suspiciously out of the back window.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The order came to let it go. We were not to follow. The blonde hadn’t moved and so nor did we. ‘We stay with Hungry Worm and the folder. We can’t risk a loss here.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was a lot at stake. Whatever intelligence about lasers the folder contained was clearly top priority. Losing it could be catastrophic. The United Kingdom relies heavily on being on the front foot in technologies like this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s partly a question of money. Our research and development on weapons is among the most advanced in the world. If another country steals it, it could cost us billions of pounds in earning power.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More importantly, though, we stand to lose our ability to defend ourselves. If certain codes and equipment were handed over to foreign intelligence, it could render our submarines and quick-reaction fast jets useless.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most people don’t realise it, but the biggest threat to our country isn’t terrorists living among us and causing the occasional atrocity, it’s the smooth-talking suit like the one who drove away in a taxi.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By now, the blonde was also on the move, walking to the car park where she, too, was met by a black cab. Everyone was on high alert as it drove her — and that precious file — away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It passed me and I let it move round a bend in the road before following discreetly. One of our motor bikes joined the surveillance from a side street, tucking in out of sight behind the taxi.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another team reported an alarming development. In his taxi, the Russian handler had doubled back and was now behind the blonde, presumably checking she wasn’t being followed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We needed to be on top of our game here. It was vital he didn’t see us, but if we gave him too much room he’d get away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And he didn’t spot us, though it was a close call at times as this strange, strung-out circus of taxis, souped-up cars and motorbikes with leather-clad riders made its way along the dual carriageway and in parallel B-roads through the quiet English countryside.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By now, the Russian had closed up on the blonde’s taxi and together they pulled into a petrol station. The updates crackled over the radio: ‘Both taxis at the fuel pumps. Dirty Boot and Hungry Worm are walking into the shop at the garage.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I knew it. This was going to be the handover of the folder.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just moments later they emerged from the shop and went towards their respective taxis. But which one now had the folder? We had to know because it was a safe bet that the two cabs would now split up and go in different directions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Who to follow if we wanted to safeguard the file? Would we have to guess?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Classic spy-craft came to our rescue. One of the most experienced members of our team, a 30-year veteran, had spotted the Russian’s shirt was hanging out at the back. It hadn’t been when he went into the shop. He must have tucked the file underneath and forgotten to tidy his clothing. It was time to stop him. He could soon be photographing the paperwork in the back of the taxi or sending it directly to a secure server before destroying the evidence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But we had to make the right call. At the time, there was much tension between London and Moscow. If we got this wrong and arrested a bona fide diplomat for no good reason, it would be extremely embarrassing for Downing Street.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We needed to check him out and the contents of the taxi, but do it in a way that gave us a sliver of deniability should it all go pear-shaped.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So Dirty Boot’s taxi was allowed to drive off while an elaborate ambush was being planned up ahead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not long afterwards, a regular police car with its blue lights flashing pulled the taxi over on the A325, ostensibly to conduct a licence check on the driver as part of a crackdown on rogue taxis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The uniformed officers — one of whom was Special Branch and in the know — had a dog with them, which could sniff out drugs. When it reacted positively, they had an excuse to impound the taxi and detain its occupants.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was a tactic designed to give the Government a plausible story to spin should a war of words break out after we kicked the Russian ‘diplomat’ out of the country.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It didn’t come to that. Instead there was a final blast over the radio from base as the operation reached its climax:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Dirty Boot is handcuffed, and one of the officers is now pulling sheets of paper from the back of his trousers. Hungry Worm and her driver have been arrested too.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’d got them. Done a great job and got the proof! And we could all go home now. Along with the rest of the team, I was on a high, knowing that Russia’s best weren’t good enough for us.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the upshot? The next morning, we were informed that Dirty Boot, the Russian spy masquerading as a diplomat, had already been escorted to the airport and told to leave the country.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hungry Worm, the blonde graduate he had turned with his promises of money and a new life in Moscow, was still in custody and more than likely wouldn’t go to jail, as she was providing information on the Russian and how he contacted her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for the poor engineer who’d been suckered into unwittingly disclosing secrets, he was left puzzling over the sudden disappearance of his new-found love.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was never actually told one of his files had been whisked from under his nose and nearly made it to Moscow. Instead, he got a warning from his boss to be more careful about his personal security in future and not let his head be turned by a pretty girl.

The US has expelled 60 officials alone and shut the Russian consulate in Seattle following the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia this month.

Tiger grew closer to his mother, who moved out of his childhood home, leaving Earl there alone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Earl ‘filled the voice by hiring a bevy of women’ to come to the property in Cypress, California, the book says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Benedict and Keteyian, the women were ‘mostly blondes and brunettes, most of whom were young enough to be Tiger’s sister’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Earl had his own executive assistant. He also had a personal assistant, traveling assistant, foundation assistant, cook, personal trainer, dog trainer, massage therapist, housekeeper and even a pedicurist.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘According to one of them, a few of these women were employed by Tiger’s corporation but some were not and were paid in cash, their unspoken job description to do whatever it took to please Earl’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tiger knew by this stage that his father had repeatedly cheated on his mother and Earl made little attempt to hide it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The authors write: ‘By 2000 Early had largely stopped showing up at tour events and the scene at Tiger’s childhood home had gotten out of hand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Women came and went. Pornography played steadily on the television. Sex toys were stuffed in drawers and sexual favors were performed at Earl’s request.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It was a house of horrors’, recalled a former employee. ‘Every drawer, every cabinet’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Benedict and Keteyian say that it is not clear how much Tiger knew about his father’s day to day life, but those who saw it first hand were appalled.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to one individual with direct knowledge of the atmosphere, he called it a ‘f****ing rodeo’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> ‘At one point a young woman who showed up for a job interview wearing a super-short mini skirt and cropped halter top promptly took a seat on Earl’s lap and hugged him.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

They identified the victims as Daniel Briel (right), 51 and his 14-year-old son, David Briel (left). David's brother, Caleb, 15, was also working them, but he managed to escape and call 911. Authorities said the boys and their father were working inside the silo when there was an 'internal collapse of silage'. Life saving efforts were attempted, but Daniel was pronounced dead at the scene. Daniel had a weak pulse, and died before he arrived to a local hospital. According to the family, David had just turned 14 years old six days before the tragedy. Dan's wife and David's mom, Melissa, was in Washington visiting her oldest son, Ben at the time. Daniel and Melissa also have a daughter, Abigail and their granddaughter Erika.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Valerie Edwards</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T02:55:09.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Father, 51, and his son, 14, die after becoming trapped in a silo</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T02:55:09.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5543323/Man-44-shoots-dead-wife-sister-couples-three-children.html" title="Man, 44, shoots dead his wife and her sister in front of the couple's three children before turning the gun on himself outside their Florida home"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5543057/Firefighters-line-streets-wake-colleague-killed-set-Edward-Nortons-film.html" title="Firefighters line the streets for the wake of colleague who was killed tackling a blaze on the set of Edward Norton's film"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.gofundme.com/dan-amp-david-briel-funeral-fund" title="www.gofundme.com..."></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.fox9.com/news/father-son-killed-after-silo-collapses-near-barron-wis" title="Father, son killed in silage collapse near Barron, Wis. - Story | KMSP"></link></item><item><title>Australia to BOYCOTT the 2018 Soccer World Cup: Julie Bishop reveals the Socceroos WON'T travel to Russia unless spy scandal is resolved</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5547735/Australia-BOYCOTT-2018-Soccer-World-Cup.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 02:09:43 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5547735</guid><description><![CDATA[The Socceroos may be forced to boycott the 2018 World Cup after two spies posing as diplomats were expelled from Australia, Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop said on Tuesday.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

The nationwide demonstrations were sparked by the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on February 14 in which 17 people were killed. Hughes, 45, is a survivor of a mass shooting after jihadists opened fire inside the Bataclan theatre in Paris while he was on stage in 2015. The singer posted five times about the gun control protests, including once when he wrote student survivors were capitalizing on the deaths of their classmates by staging protest walkouts. Emma Gonzalez and David Hogg, both survivors of the Parkland school shooting, gave stirring speeches in Washington DC on Saturday as part of the protest.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Emily Crane</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T08:39:43.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Eagles of Death Metal singer slams March for Our Lives supporters</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T08:39:43.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5542535/Rick-Santorum-says-teens-learn-CPR-instead-protesting-passage-phony-gun-laws.html" title="Rick Santorum says teens should learn CPR instead of protesting for the passage of 'phony gun laws' "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5542391/Tiffany-Trump-likes-Instagram-photo-March-Lives-poster.html" title="Mutiny!

Warner, along with Smith and Bancroft will be among the first players interviewed, with Smith and Warner in particular expected to be suspended for 'a stretch of time'. As the scandal deepens, a long-time teammate of both Smith and Warner said he believed the skipper wasn't to blame, and was trying to protect a younger player when he admitted to giving the green light to tamper with the ball. New South Wales star all-rounder Moises Henriques (bottom right with Smith and Nic Maddinson) said '10 minutes of panic' at the end of day's play led to the press conference which has left Smith's reputation in tatters.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Max Margan</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T10:23:02.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>David Warner named as 'chief conspirator' in ball-tampering scandal</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T10:23:02.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5547093/Darren-Lehmann-resigns-Australian-cricket-coach-Steve-Smith-scandal-ball-tampering-scandal.html" title="Australian cricket coach Darren Lehmann ¿set to RESIGN¿ in wake of ball-tampering scandal that shamed Australia"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5543353/Cricket-Australias-Tim-Paine-says-teammates-world-pain.html" title="'They're struggling¿ it's been a horrible 24 hours': Acting captain Tim Paine says his cheating teammates are in a world of pain ¿ but vows to 'make Australia proud' in next Test match "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5546575/The-Candyman-makes-fun-ball-tampering-disgrace-racy-shots.html" title="Cricket scandal reaches the Candy Shop Mansion!

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">They're still in love: Eric Stewart of 10cc and his wife Gloria pose in 1970 </p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">After all, when they'd met — at one of his gigs at Halifax Town Hall in 1964 — he'd been poleaxed by the beautiful 16-year-old. ('I went gaga! Completely gaga!' he says today.)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, then, Eric thought again. Even better, he secretly wrote an ironic song explaining exactly how deeply he adored her, how desperately he pined for her when he was away, how he hung her picture on his wall and gazed at it — all without using those three little words.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric wanted to write a love song for his wife without saying 'I love you'. He wanted to show the conflict between feeling a certain way, yet avoiding those words.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The result, I'm Not In Love, was a massive hit in 1975, going to No 1 in charts all around the world; it earned endless royalties and inspired an entire generation of musicians.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Everyone over the age of 40 knows the lyrics 'I'm not in love, so don't forget it; it's just a silly phase I'm going through'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The song has been the soundtrack to countless romantic moments. It also made Eric and fellow Mancunian band members, Graham Gouldman (who co-wrote the song), Kevin Godley and Lol Creme, very rich. Even more important, it placated the lovely Gloria. Earlier this month, they celebrated their 52nd wedding anniversary with a big dinner for friends.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Eric Stewart and his wife Gloria are pictured celebrating a wedding anniversary in recent year</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We try to be romantic — we send each other cards and flowers and surprise each other. It's important to keep that side going,' says Gloria, who is still a vision, with blonde hair, pink cheeks and great legs. 'Even if sometimes someone needs a bit of a reminder . . .'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric is more prosaic. 'The fact it's lasted 52 years, especially in the music business is bloody astounding,' he says. 'Because you're tempted all the time!'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now 73, he looks more like a rather meek music teacher than a rock star who has worked with all the greats, from Paul McCartney to the Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder to James Brown.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As he offers me a flapjack, it's easy to forget that, in the halcyon days of the mid-Seventies, 10cc — christened in 1972 by record producer Jonathan King (later convicted of child sex abuse) who signed them to his label and then had a dream about a chart-topping band under that name — were the most popular group in the world for a time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That night he met Gloria in 1964, Eric, a 19-year-old self-taught guitarist, was well established on the music scene. His band, Wayne Fontana &amp; the Mindbenders, was riding the wave of their first major hit, and was a popular live attraction throughout the UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gloria, who'd grown up on a dairy farm in Haworth, West Yorkshire, was still at school, although modelling in her spare time. She'd gone along to the gig in Halifax with her friend, Pauline Matthews (now better known as the singer, Kiki Dee).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Apparently, Kiki quite fancied me!' says Eric, pink-faced at the notion. 'But when Gloria walked in I was dumbfounded. She was gorgeous, stunning. It was love at first sight!'</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img" style="height: auto;">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Gloria met Eric, a 19-year-old self-taught guitarist, when he was already well established on the music scene</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">He asked if she'd like to hop in the band's van to see a gig in Manchester with Eric Clapton later than night. 'Yeah. OK,' was Gloria's reply. And in an instant, her dreams of A-levels and art school flew out of the window.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ignoring her father's gruff 'I'll give it two years', she became wife to one of the biggest pop stars in the world at just 18. On their wedding day, March 10, 1966, the Mindbenders (without Wayne Fontana) were back at No 2 with A Groovy Kind Of Love.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gloria's father shouldn't have worried because Eric and his band members — the Mindbenders and 10cc (which grew out of trio called Hotlegs) — were never very rock 'n' roll.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They didn't smash up hotel rooms — 'I was more likely to fix a broken shower rail than break anything. I love mending things!'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And until The Beatles introduced him to Scotch and Coke ('a very dangerous drink'), even booze was thin on the ground.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There was no time,' he says. 'When we got back to our hotel at night the kitchen would be closed and we'd get up in the morning and straight onto a flight.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whatever, 10cc might not have been the coolest band in the world, but there were groupies. Did he and the others take advantage? 'We weren't that sort of band,' he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I ask Gloria if she ever worried he'd been tempted. 'Well, I've no idea whether he was, or not,' she says. 'But you have to trust and hope for the best. It wasn't easy.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the birth of their daughter, Dieta, she moved back in with her parents for a time, as Eric jetted around the world. 'I didn't see much of him for the first few years,' she says and agrees that the pressures would have broken many couples — but not them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I've never been looking for anyone else and I've never met anyone to make me want to leave Gloria,' says Eric. 'I've just always really, really loved her. Even if I didn't always say it in the early years.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I'm Not In Love put that right. Gloria knew nothing about it until the band invited the wives (her sister, Angie, is married to guitarist Lol Creme) to hear it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It sent shivers down the spine,' she says. 'It was very special.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even better, from that day on, Eric started telling Gloria he loved her again. 'Well, he had to then, didn't he?' she says archly.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">10cc went on to have five of their albums certified gold</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before I'm Not In Love, 10cc had had a string of hits and were the critics' darlings, but that song put them in the major league.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric played with the Stones and adores Keith Richards ('he's crazy now, but I still love him'), dislikes Jagger ('rude and a prima donna'), built a multi-million-pound house in Surrey and snapped up a slew of fast cars and a holiday house in Barbados, where they hung out with the McCartneys.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The couples were great friends, both living in East Sussex. Paul and Eric played together, and Linda and Gloria went horse-riding. Both battled breast cancer at the same time, but while Gloria survived, Linda, sadly, didn't.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric and Gloria were not big partygoers and never embraced drugs. Marijuana sent Eric to sleep and 'did nothing' for Gloria, other than give her 'a scratchy throat'. The closest they came to the hard stuff was in the late Seventies, when Eric and jet-lagged U.S. drummer Steve Gadd snorted cocaine every night for a week while recording.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When I played back what we'd done, it was awful! Never again,' says Eric. 'And never LSD — the Beatles tried it, John and Paul, and they really did suffer later.' Eric's most rock-starry splurge was his car collection — Bugattis, Jaguars, Alfa Romeos. 'I once got up to 174mph on an empty motorway in a Ferrari Boxer, with Gloria in the passenger seat!' he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gosh! What on earth did she say?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Slow down! And don't do it again. It was a thrill, but she was right.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But one night in 1979, she wasn't there to tell him off. Driving back from his studio, a little too relaxed after a couple of rum and Cokes, seatbelt undone, he hit a spot of black ice and crashed into a tree.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eric fractured his skull, damaged his left eye and lost the hearing in his left ear. It took him a year to recover and, when he did, 10cc's time in the spotlight was fading.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It was a very difficult time,' says Gloria quietly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today, the cars are all gone. 'Now she tells me off for buying too many sweaters!' says Eric.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, all marriages are full of ups and downs and Eric and Gloria have had their share.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's been a rollercoaster and I'm not sure how we've managed to stay together all this time,' says Gloria. 'But we have. It can only be because we just love each other.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But also because they've worked at it, focusing on joint interests — doing up houses (here and in France), walking the dog, going out for dinner together at least once a week — and spending time with their two children (they had a son, Jody, in 1980) and their grandson, Christian.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Does Eric use the 'L' word now?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Oh yes! Every single night! 'Goodnight, I love you,' I say, just before we turn the lights out. And she always says, 'I love you' back.' </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>After nine years of marriage, one daughter and years of enforced separation caused by relentless touring with his band 10cc (inset), Eric Stewart’s wife Gloria (pictured left and right together) started complaining that he no longer told her he loved her.

Donald Trump ordered 60 of Vladimir Putin's (pictured, main) diplomats out of the country and also announced a consulate in Seattle is being shut down. And within minutes of the announcement the stand-off had sparked a war of words on social media. Ukraine's Twitter account posted a message mocking the Kremlin (pictured top left).

'When you attack our friends, you will face serious consequences,' one senior administration official said of the message to Russia.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Francesca Chambers</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T21:33:26.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Trump kicks out 60 Russian spies in retaliation for nerve gas attack</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T21:33:26.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Russia,Donald Trump,Vladimir Putin,Breaking News</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5544771/Ten-EU-countries-prepare-expel-Russian-spies.html" title="World turns against Putin: America and 22 other states expel Kremlin spies as May boasts of 'dismantling Russian espionage network' in wake of Salisbury poisoning - before Moscow vows to 'respond to every country' "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5527345/Trump-furious-leak-staff-urged-NOT-congratulate-Putin.html" title="Trump furious at new top-level leaks following story that he ignored national security team's instruction saying 'DO NOT CONGRATULATE' when he called Putin after suspicious election"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5505477/White-House-unveils-new-sanctions-against-Putins-spies.html" title="'It looks like the Russians were behind it': White House unveils new sanctions against Putin - focused on his spies and cronies - as Trump joins France, Germany and the UK in condemning nerve gas attack"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5545113/Trump-finally-hints-response-Stormy-Daniels.html" title="Trump did NOT have sex with Stormy Daniels and did NOT have her threatened says the White House as it denies all the porn star's bombshell claims "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5545635/Twitter-asks-Stormy-Daniels-pupils-dilated-interview.html" title="'Why are Stormy Daniels' pupils so dilated in that bright room?'

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Stormy Daniels (right) told Anderson Cooper (left) that she spanked the now-president when they first met, and that a man threatened her back in 2011 after she spoke to a tabloid magazine about the alleged affair with Donald Trump</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There are old, recycled reports, which were published and strongly denied prior to the election,' an unnamed official told the newspaper.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another denial of Trump's came via Cohen. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'President Trump once again vehemently denies any such occurrence as has Ms. Daniels,' Cohen said.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He didn't deny the payment at the time, though later admitted to making the transfer. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels, in her interview with 60 Minutes, explained she had signed off on a statement denying the affair this year 'because they made it sound like I had no choice.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She told Cooper that because she had signed the non-disclosure agreement, if she didn't sign the statement she was concerned she would be in legal peril.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'As a matter of fact, the exact sentence used was, "They can make your life hell in many different ways,"' Daniels said she was told. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During his rounds on morning television Monday, Daniels' attorney Michael Avenatti also pointed out that Trump has never personally denied the relationship. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Well actually, the president has never denied it. He's been silent. He can tweet on every other subject known to mankind. For some reason, he can' deny the affair,' Avenatti said.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He can't come out and deny the existence of the agreement and his knowledge of it. And can't deny the $130,000 payment. Why is that?' Daniels' lawyer also challenged. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When reporters asked Trump about the interview as he was traveling back to Washington, D.C., Sunday night he ignored their questions.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump is being told to keep his mouth closed, as advisers think it's not a good look for a president to be in a public he-said, she-said with a porn star, according to <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/rebeccaballhaus/status/978348236019822593">reporting from the Wall Street Journal</a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On CNN Monday, former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci expressed just that.<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/cnn/index.html"> </a></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Well, listen, I haven't talked to him about this specific strategy here, but I think the best thing to do here, and if I was offering any advice: Let it go, at this point, and move on,' Scaramucci said. 'Let the news cycle create another news cycle and it will be different information out there.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Mooch also suggested that even if the president had a decade-old extramarital liaison with an adult film actress, it's not such a big deal in 2018.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think there will be less fallout than people think because people have been anesthetized to these sort of scandals, it goes all the way back to President Clinton,' Scaramucci said. 'So to me, I think that, we'll talk about it, there will be another news cycle and then people will move on, that's my prediction.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over on Fox &amp; Friends Monday morning, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley wasn't even asked about it. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In his series of morning show interviews, Avenatti hinted things could get worse for the president. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 60 Minutes interview, for instance, could have been tawdrier. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'She was prepared to discuss intimate details relating to Mr. Trump,' the porn star's lawyer said. 'She can describe his genitalia. She can describe various conversations that they had that leave no doubt as to whether this woman is telling the truth.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And if she's not telling the truth, let the president take to the podium and call her a liar,' the lawyer continued. 'Let the president come forward and say it never happened.'    </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While Shah used a lack of evidence to make his case from the White House podium, Avenatti had already indicated on Good Morning America that there could be some coming down the pipeline.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We're in the very early stages of this case, and we're not gonna play all of our cards at this juncture. No good attorney would,' said Avenatti.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There's gonna be a lot of evidence  that will come to light in the coming weeks and months and we're confident that when all of the facts are laid bare for the American people they're gonna learn exactly what happened here,' the lawyer said. </p><div class="mol-img-group floatRHS" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

Forget the story." And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, "That’s a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom." And then he was gone,' Daniels said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said, seven years later, she'd still be able to recognize him. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If he walked in this door right now, I would instantly know,' Daniels told Cooper. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avenatti charged Monday morning, 'It had to come from someone associated with Mr. Trump.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It didn't come from the magazine. That makes no sense. It was certainly not my client. There's only one other place that could have come from.

I was not a victim.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> Daniels said her night with Trump began with him talking about himself and showing her an issue of a magazine with his picture on the cover. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Does this normally work for you?' Daniels said she told the then-reality TV star.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That threw Trump off guard she claimed, going on to explain: 'And I was like, "Someone should take that magazine and spank you with it."'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels then ordered Trump to drop his pants and 'gave him a couple swats' in playful manner she said to Cooper.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said they talked some more after that and that she became more comfortable when he stopped speaking about himself.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He was like, "Wow, you - you are special. You remind me of my daughter." You know - he was like, "You're smart and beautiful, and a woman to be reckoned with, and I like you. I like you,"' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pair had dinner in Trump's room she said and then had sex. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He didn't use a condom, she said, and she didn't ask him to. Afterward, he asked to see her again, she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels said that before they had sex Trump had broached the idea of her being a contestant on The Apprentice, and she likened it to a 'business opportunity.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the alleged tryst she said he called her several times and would ask if they could get together again and would claim that he had an update for her about the Apprentice. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said she felt that he was holding out the opportunity to keep her coming back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Of course. I mean, I'm not blind. But at the same time, maybe it'll work out, you know?' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In July 2007, a year after they had met, Daniels said Trump asked to meet with her privately at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. She said they did not have sex, but he wanted to. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels reported that Trump called her the following month to say he had not been able to get her a spot on his TV show. She said they never met again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When asked why she was deciding to speak now, Daniels said: 'Because it was very important to me to be able to defend myself.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said she was not all that bothered by what other people thought of her, but had a big issuer with being portrayed as someone who did not tell the truth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm not OK with being made out to be a liar, or people thinking that I did this for money and people are like, "Oh, you're an opportunist. You're taking advantage of this,"' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Yes, I'm getting more job offers now, but tell me one person who would turn down a job offer making more than they've been making, doing the same thing that they've always done?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cooper noted during the interview that Melania Trump had given birth just a few months before the alleged encounter between the two. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Did he mention his wife or child at all in this?' asked Cooper. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I asked. And he brushed it aside, said, "Oh yeah, yeah, you know, don't worry about that. We don't even, we have separate rooms and stuff,'' said Daniels. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just a few days prior, former Playboy model Karen McDougal told Cooper in a CNN interview that her affair with Trump began at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2006. McDougal said she ended the relationship in 2007 out of guilt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">McDougal has filed suit in Los Angeles seeking to invalidate a confidentiality agreement with American Media Inc., the company that owns the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer. It paid her $150,000 during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The lawsuit alleges that McDougal was paid for the rights to her story of an affair, but the story never ran.

No good attorney would,' said Avenatti.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There's gonna be a lot of evidence  that will come to light in the coming weeks and months and we're confident that when all of the facts are laid bare for the American people they're gonna learn exactly what happened here.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This includes the identify of the individual who allegedly threatened Daniels back in 2011 and how she received her reported $130,000 payout after signing a non-disclosure agreement two weeks before the election.  </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avenatti said that while President Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen may have cut the check for $130,000, he is not the person who ultimately covered that sizable payout. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think when all is said and done, it will be clear that it did not come from [Cohen] or there was a promise of reimbursement,' stated Avenatti. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Regardless, Mr Cohen and the president have a significant problem related to this $130,000 and the agreement.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He addressed the individual who threatened his client seven years ago as well, soon after she detailed her alleged one-night stand with President Trump in an interview. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It had to have come from someone associated with Mr. Trump,' explained Avenatti. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It didn't come from the magazine. That makes no sense. It was certainly not my client. There's only one other place that could have come from. And that threat was terrifying to my client.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When asked if his client told anyone or went to the police after that threat, Avenatti responded: 'She was scared. No.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was then pointed out that this might make the story difficult to stand up, which Avenatti denied, saying: 'I don't think so. I think we're going to get to the bottom of this. The threat, the agreement, the bottom of the $130,000 payment.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels' lawyer also said at one point that President trump had never denied the affair, a claim which was met with immediate push back as it was pointed out there have been many denials. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Well actually, the president has never denied it. He's been silent. He can tweet on every other subject known the mankind. For some reason, he can't deny the affair,' said Avenatti. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He can't come out and deny the existence of the agreement and his knowledge of it. And can't deny the $130,000 payment. Why is that?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avenatti also addressed whether or not he was concerned about his client possibly losing everything, as she is now facing a $20 million lawsuit for speaking out. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Our position is that the NDA was never executed and it was never valid for a host of reasons and we're confident that a court is going to find that, he stated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We have a litany of more evidence in this case. And it's going to be disclosed. And it's going to be laid bare for the American public.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He then confirmed that this included direct evidence to prove an affair occurred between his client and President Trump. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avenatti ended things be responding to a question about why he chose to hold back during his client's big moment on Sunday night.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I don't think that was our biggest possible platform and we're gonna be smart and we want to be deliberate,' he explained. </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

Afterward, he asked to see her again, she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels said that before they had sex Trump had broached the idea of her being a contestant on The Apprentice, and she likened it to a 'business opportunity.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the alleged tryst she said he called her several times and would ask if they could get together again and would claim that he had an update for her about the Apprentice. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said she felt that he was holding out the opportunity to keep her coming back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Of course. I mean, I'm not blind. But at the same time, maybe it'll work out, you know?' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In July 2007, a year after they had met, Daniels said Trump asked to meet with her privately at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. She said they did not have sex, but he wanted to.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels reported that Trump called her the following month to say he had not been able to get her a spot on his TV show. She said they never met again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When asked why she was deciding to speak now, Daniels said: 'Because it was very important to me to be able to defend myself.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said she was not all that bothered by what other people thought of her, but had a big issuer with being portrayed as someone who did not tell the truth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm not OK with being made out to be a liar, or people thinking that I did this for money and people are like, "Oh, you're an opportunist. You're taking advantage of this,"' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Yes, I'm getting more job offers now, but tell me one person who would turn down a job offer making more than they've been making, doing the same thing that they've always done?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cooper noted during the interview that Melania Trump had given birth just a few months before the alleged encounter between the two. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Did he mention his wife or child at all in this?' asked Cooper. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I asked. And he brushed it aside, said, "Oh yeah, yeah, you know, don't worry about that. We don't even, we have separate rooms and stuff,'' said Daniels. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just a few days prior, former Playboy model Karen McDougal told Cooper in a CNN interview that her affair with Trump began at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2006. McDougal said she ended the relationship in 2007 out of guilt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">McDougal has filed suit in Los Angeles seeking to invalidate a confidentiality agreement with American Media Inc., the company that owns the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer. It paid her $150,000 during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The lawsuit alleges that McDougal was paid for the rights to her story of an affair, but the story never ran. It also alleges that Cohen was secretly involved in her discussions with American Media.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump is also facing a New York defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Zervos has accused Trump of unwanted sexual contact in 2007 after she had appeared on the show with him, and sued after he dismissed the claims as made up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A judge ruled the lawsuit can move forward while the president is in office. </p><mol-permabox id="mol-d33abc10-30f6-11e8-a2b6-ad61e6d08014"></mol-permabox><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Stormy Daniels revealed little new information about her alleged one-night stand with President Trump on 60 Minutes, but there was at least one question she was prepared to answer that never came up during the interview. 'She was prepared to discuss intimate details relating to Mr Trump,' Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenatti said Monday during an appearance on Today. 'She can describe his genitalia. She can describe various conversations that they had that leave no doubt as to whether this woman is telling the truth.' He then added: 'And if she's not telling the truth, let the president take to the podium and call her a liar.

This modest purchase price - the cost of a flat in parts of central London - is just the beginning of a mammoth investment needed by the trust as it works to reverse decades of decay. Trust chief executive Sarah McLeod believes that the total bill could be between £150 and £200 million. This is because the task she faces is epic. Wentworth Woodhouse's 606ft facade (pictured centre) is wider than Buckingham Palace - a building it stood in for during the filming of Oscar-nominated movie Darkest Hour - and its floor area is about the same as the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Alex Green</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T14:04:32.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Mansion with 600ft-wide facade set for £200M renovation</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T14:04:32.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5542143/Wayne-Coleen-Rooneys-luxurious-20m-custom-built-mansion-Cheshire-takes-shape.html" title="Wayne's OTHER manor: Rooney's monster £20MILLION home complete with football pitch, wine cellar and fishing lakes takes shape as he prepares to move his family in from £6m Cheshire pad"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5540149/British-state-school-troublemakers-attend-Indias-Eton-learn-hard-lessons.html" title="Unique TV experiment sends five British state school troublemakers to 'India's Eton' to learn some VERY hard lessons "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5541163/President-Trumps-older-sister-selling-eight-bedroom-beachfront-home-Florida-23M.html" title="Good deals run in the family!

But every now and then there comes a moment when our national attitudes to sport divide us, the great Australian sense of humour takes a pasting and sport acquires unnecessary layers of spite.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The answer is for us to hit back. As England great Ian Botham did when he received some hard words from the then Australian prime minister Paul Keating after he had walked out of an event in which the Queen had been mocked.

Australia's inconsistency in their sporting approach to cricket can be traced back to the famous Bodyline series of 1932-33 in Australia, in which England bowled fast balls at the body (top right). It was tactic designed to nullify the greatest batsman in history, Don Bradman. And mostly it worked. The Australians sent a telegram to Lord's demanding that the tactic be stopped at once, and got a pretty stiff response. England won the series 4-1 and Australians are whining about it to this day. Fast forward to 1974-75, when the England team were beaten all ends up by the tactic of… fast bowling directed at the body. 'The sound of breaking Pommy skulls is music to my ears,' said bowler Jeff Thomson. England sent no telegrams. Talking of a lack of sportsmanship, let's not forget the moment in 1981 when New Zealand were playing Australia and needed a six off the last ball to draw the match. Captain Greg Chappell instructed his brother Trevor to bowl the last ball underarm (bottom right) – making it impossible to hit a six.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Lara Keay</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T13:42:25.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>COMMENT: The Aussies have always been cheats (and whingers)</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T13:42:25.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>South Africa</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5542607/Steve-Smith-David-Warner-facing-life-bans-ball-tampering-scandal.html" title="Cheats to be 'banned for life': Steve Smith and David Warner may NEVER play for Australia again after ball-tampering scandal - but Michael Clarke says the disgraced captain 'should be FORGIVEN'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5542719/Skins-sportswear-CEO-pens-scathing-open-letter-Cricket-Australia-board.html" title="'This is OUR sport, not just yours': Skins sportswear CEO pens scathing open letter to the Cricket Australia board following ball tampering scandal - as team takes refuge in hotel"></link></item><item><title>Devastated family bury 'remains' of their oriental tabby cat Willow who went missing during Beast from the East storm - only for him to stroll into their garden days later</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5545047/Devastated-family-bury-cat-strolls-garden-days-later.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 12:55:51 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5545047</guid><description><![CDATA[Jonny and Caterina Robinson held a memorial service for their beloved pet (pictured) in their garden in Hope under Dinmore, Herefordshire, but were stunned when he turned up two days later.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

She said that slaves used to drink it, so now she does, too. Medical experts disagree with Haddish's choice to ingest the oil, distilled from pine resine, although she is correct that historical records show the liquid has been used in the distant past to attempt to treat illnesses. But prevailing medical experts today consider turpentine to be a poison.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Stephanie Haney</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T18:35:12.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>'A teaspoon of turpentine will not kill you,' Haddish told GQ</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T18:35:12.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5462411/Mike-Young-Lake-Elsinore-years-Gary-Chicago.html" title="Meet this year's 'Gary from Chicago'!

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The porn star claimed that she was  approached by an unidentified man in Las Vegas and told to remain quiet about her alleged relationship with Trump, an incident that she said happened while she was with her young daughter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said in the interview that she had one encounter of consensual sex with the future president.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He knows I'm telling the truth,' said Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She did not allege however that she was coerced into the encounter with the real estate scion, saying, 'This is not a Me too.

You remind me of my daughter." You know - he was like, "You're smart and beautiful, and a woman to be reckoned with, and I like you. I like you,"' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pair had dinner in Trump's room she said and then had sex. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He didn't use a condom, she said, and she didn't ask him to. Afterward, he asked to see her again, she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels said that before they had sex Trump had broached the idea of her being a contestant on The Apprentice, and she likened it to a 'business opportunity.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the alleged tryst she said he called her several times and would ask if they could get together again and would claim that he had an update for her about the Apprentice. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said she felt that he was holding out the opportunity to keep her coming back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Of course. I mean, I'm not blind. But at the same time, maybe it'll work out, you know?' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In July 2007, a year after they had met, Daniels said Trump asked to meet with her privately at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. She said they did not have sex, but he wanted to.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Daniels reported that Trump called her the following month to say he had not been able to get her a spot on his TV show. She said they never met again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When asked why she was deciding to speak now, Daniels said: 'Because it was very important to me to be able to defend myself.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said she was not all that bothered by what other people thought of her, but had a big issuer with being portrayed as someone who did not tell the truth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm not OK with being made out to be a liar, or people thinking that I did this for money and people are like, "Oh, you're an opportunist. You're taking advantage of this,"' said Daniels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Yes, I'm getting more job offers now, but tell me one person who would turn down a job offer making more than they've been making, doing the same thing that they've always done?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cooper noted during the interview that Melania Trump had given birth just a few months before the alleged encounter between the two. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Did he mention his wife or child at all in this?' asked Cooper. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I asked. And he brushed it aside, said, "Oh yeah, yeah, you know, don't worry about that. We don't even, we have separate rooms and stuff,'' said Daniels. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just a few days prior, former Playboy model Karen McDougal told Cooper in a CNN interview that her affair with Trump began at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2006. McDougal said she ended the relationship in 2007 out of guilt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">McDougal has filed suit in Los Angeles seeking to invalidate a confidentiality agreement with American Media Inc., the company that owns the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer. It paid her $150,000 during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The lawsuit alleges that McDougal was paid for the rights to her story of an affair, but the story never ran. It also alleges that Cohen was secretly involved in her discussions with American Media.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trump is also facing a New York defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Zervos has accused Trump of unwanted sexual contact in 2007 after she had appeared on the show with him, and sued after he dismissed the claims as made up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A judge ruled the lawsuit can move forward while the president is in office. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>There has been a deluge of new Stormy Daniels fans over the past few weeks, and the porn star is doing her best to capitalize on the situation.

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">When Paul (pictured) and Gordon Singer are owed money, they don’t just send out polite invoices and hope that a cheque comes back in the post</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Though she denounced the Singers as ‘unscrupulous financiers’, ‘vultures’ and ‘financial terrorists’ during the kerfuffle, Elliott Advisors had the last laugh: Argentina’s debts, which it had acquired for a knockdown $117 million during the country’s 2001 financial crisis, were settled soon afterwards, netting the hedge fund a tidy $2.3 billion profit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The saga, which helped drive Kirchner from office, cemented the reputation of the secretive duo, and their 400-odd employees, as some of Wall Street’s most aggressive enforcers — an outfit of feared corporate raiders who have built a multi-billion-dollar fortune by treating business like hand-to-hand combat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just before Christmas, Fortune Magazine wrote another chapter in the firm’s controversial history by publishing a lengthy investigation into the culture and methods of Elliott, based on court filings and interviews with more than 40 people who had suffered the often bruising experience of crossing it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The article claimed, among other things, that executives at several companies in dispute with the hedge fund believed it had hired private investigators to make inquiries about them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The article went on to claim that neighbours of one CEO were asked on their doorstep about ‘loud parties’ held at his home.

  </div>

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Gordon Singer (left) has his sights set on the British engineering giant GKN (he is pictured in Beverly Hills)</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Elliott denied the article’s claim that its private investors targeted children, and insisted that it had ‘always behaved ethically in its disputes’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But whatever the truth, the allegations only hardened the 40-year-old firm’s reputation as, to quote one headline, ‘the world’s most ruthless hedge fund’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s also one of the most secretive. The company’s 400 employees are largely banned from social media, and prevented from posting images of themselves online, making them, as Fortune put it ‘virtual ghosts in the digital era’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gordon Singer, 44, who runs its UK operations, lives with his 41-year-old wife Jennifer in a gated mansion — on a leafy street near St John’s Wood Tube station in North London — which the couple bought for £4.9 million in 2006.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Beyond that, little is known of him. The only photographs of him that appear to exist outside of family albums are at the 2011 Golden Globes party, where he met actresses Jane Seymour, a former Bond girl, and Melissa Leo, who won Best Supporting Actress for The Fighter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Paul, a divorced 72-year-old father of two grown-up sons who founded the firm in the Seventies, has homes in the elite ski resort of Aspen, Colorado, and in The Beresford, an exclusive apartment building in New York Upper West side which is also home to comedian Jerry Seinfeld and actress Glenn Close.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His firm’s investment in GKN is in some ways a typical hedge-funder’s approach: they hope to bank a quick profit from the increase or ‘bump’ in value that a successful bid will provide to the firm’s share price — something that is known in the trade as ‘bumpitrage’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although most of Elliott’s 3.4 per cent shareholding in GKN was acquired very recently, they also get a say in this week’s vote to decide whether the takeover should go ahead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many business leaders believe this should not be allowed, since it means they and other global hedge funds which invested recently — hedge funds now own around a quarter of GKN’s share ownership — will now have a huge level of influence over the 259-year-old British firm’s future.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I do not believe short-term shareholders that have been holding shares for a number of weeks should have the right to vote on a long-term strategic business for the country,’ complains the industrialist Sir John Parker.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He told The Sunday Times that only long-term investors, who have held a firm’s stock for more than six months, ought to be allowed to take part in such a ballot.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whether the Government shares that view is unclear, although supporters of GKN hope that its position will not be swayed by the fact that Elliott Advisors are longstanding donors to the Conservative Party.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2008, they gave Boris Johnson £5,000, while in 2016 they handed the Party £10,000, according to the company’s UK accounts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the political front, Paul Singer is also a longstanding donor to the Republican party in the U.S. He is not a fan of Donald Trump, however, and has fallen out with social conservatives after becoming an advocate of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights a few years back, when the younger of his two sons, Andrew, came out as homosexual and married his partner, a doctor.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Regardless of how things play out this week, bruising disputes are meat and drink to Singer Snr, who has grown his firm from nothing into a $40 billion behemoth with offices in New York, London and Hong Kong, becoming a billionaire twice over in the process.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In addition to being a past master at the art of ‘bumpitrage’, he’s also regarded in financial circles as one of the world’s most combative ‘activist’ investors — who likes to build up stakes in underperforming businesses in order to force them to restructure, sack senior executives or even put themselves up for sale.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, Elliott Advisors (which has returned average profits of almost 10 per cent a year for the past five years) is, by market capital, the world’s largest ‘activist’ fund.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Often, corporate raids are by their very nature hostile. Indeed, the Singers have in recent years engaged in ugly disputes with bosses of a raft of companies which they have sought to reform, from Alliance Trust, whose British boss Katherine Garrett-Cox was forced out after Elliott accused her of being overpaid and incompetent, to the owners of Dulux Paint, who it recently hauled into court.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During disputes, Singer’s firm will batter its rivals with legal threats or publish withering public critiques of their alleged shortcomings. And sometimes, Singer’s sparring partners are even goaded into a response.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Samsung, for example, once published images of him online with a photoshopped vulture’s beak, during a row over a bid to sell off its engineering arm.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

In the late Nineties, for example, the firm acquired Congolese government debt though a Cayman Islands vehicle and set about clawing money back through the London courts in a campaign over several years, eventually winning £78 million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As that episode showed, corporate raiding can be very lucrative indeed. The firm’s latest UK accounts show that in 2016 it paid £65 million in wages and salaries to 79 employees in Britain, meaning its average staffer earned more than £800,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2013, which was regarded as a particularly good year, its highest-paid UK director trousered an astonishing £38 million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whether 2018 will end with a similar payday for the people behind the world’s most ruthless hedge fund depends, at least in part, on whether its wish for GKN to be sold off is granted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>'When Paul and Gordon Singer are owed money, they don’t just send out polite invoices and hope that a cheque comes back in the post,' writes Guy Adams.

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Universities should never be ‘safe spaces’ for students as this puts free speech at risk, former Labour frontbencher Harriet Harman (pictured) has said</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Safe space’ policies have been adopted by many student unions in a bid to create ‘an environment on campus free from harassment and fear’, the report said. But in reality it has resulted in unions trying to shut down people with unfashionable or unpopular views, such as pro-life, humanist and secular groups, the report warned. It said such censorship was ‘unacceptable’ because the free exchange of ideas – as long as they comply with the law – is ‘vital in universities’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The report said: ‘The whole of the university cannot be a “safe space”. Universities must be places where open debate can take place so that students can develop their own opinions on unpopular, controversial or provocative ideas.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Groups or individuals holding unpopular opinions which are within the law should not be shut down nor be subject to undue additional scrutiny by student unions or universities.’</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Former Labour frontbencher Miss Harman, who has been a women’s campaigner all her life, said: ‘Freedom of speech within the law should mean just that – and it is vital in universities.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The committee, which is made up of MPs and peers, found that students generally supported the idea of free speech. But they also found evidence of youngsters who had tried to get unions to ban speakers using ‘safe space’ policies. It comes after so-called anti-fascist masked protesters stormed a student event at King’s College London and punched a security guard this month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chris Hale, director of policy at Universities UK, said: ‘Universities are absolutely committed to promoting and securing free speech and will not allow legitimate speech to be stifled. We will look at the advice of the committee in this area and how it can complement the already-extensive experience of managing such events and policies universities have in place.’ </p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

Speaking today on the BBC show, Ms Urquhart also said the family have 'doubts' about the thoroughness of the police investigation to find him, and that there are 'inconsistencies in the data' police have used.

An employee at the Lubbock city landfill spotted a brand-new piece of luggage amid the mountain of trash, opened the suitcase and discovered Baldwin's beaten naked body stuffed inside.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>AP</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Wires</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-27T08:07:06.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Texas 'suitcase killer' Rosendo Rodriguez III to be executed Tuesday</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-27T08:07:06.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5546543/Man-convicted-teens-murder-sentenced-death-penalty.html" title="Sex offender is sentenced to death for kidnapping a girl, 14, from a bus stop, torturing her with an electric drill, raping and murdering her in an abandoned home"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5545221/Three-year-old-girl-dies-overdosing-meth-parents-arrested.html" title="Mother, 29, is charged with murder after her three-year-old daughter was left alone for 22 hours and died of a METH overdose"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.kcbd.com/story/37809417/rosendo-rodriguez-turns-38-today-the-day-before-his-scheduled-execution" title="Rosendo Rodriguez turns 38 today, the day before his scheduled e - KCBD NewsChannel 11 Lubbock"></link></item><item><title>ASK THE GP: Which prostate operation would you have if you were me? </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5547459/ASK-GP-prostate-operation-me.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 00:11:18 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5547459</guid><description><![CDATA[GP Dr Martin Scurr answers questions about prostate operations and discusses the different procedures that are available to you.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="health-ccox">For a long time I’ve suffered from an enlarged prostate, but I cope quite well so I’ve managed to avoid surgery. Nevertheless, when I heard about UroLift I thought I’d finally found the answer. Now I’ve read about yet another procedure, PAE (prostate artery embolisation). If you were in my shoes, which procedure would you choose?</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="health-ccox">Norman Wanstall, Burford, Worcs.</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After four decades in medical practice I have learned to be cautious of any new drug or treatment, medical or surgical, especially before making recommendations, because experience tells me that new quite often isn’t better and can sometimes end up being worse.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An enlarged prostate, known medically as benign prostatic hyperplasia, is increasingly common in men with age.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over the years, male hormones cause the gland — which sits around the urethra and underneath the bladder — to become slowly enlarged. This can obstruct the urethra, leading to a poor stream, hesitancy (an intermittent stream), urgency (needing to go in a hurry) and nocturia (going more than once at night).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Medications can be very effective — alpha-blockers work by relaxing the muscle of the prostate tissue, while alpha-reductase inhibitors block the effects of male hormones — but a significant number of men do still require surgery.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since the Eighties, the most popular option has been transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), a keyhole procedure where a wire, guided by a camera, is inserted into the urethra then heated to burn away some of the enlarged gland.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">TURP remains the gold standard because it’s the only procedure that long-term studies have shown is safe and effective.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, some men fear TURP as it involves a general anaesthetic and two or three days in hospital. Some are also anxious about the potential risks, as TURP can damage a sphincter (or valve) at the entrance of the bladder, causing retrograde ejaculation — where semen is sent backwards into the bladder. Erectile function is not harmed, but patients are no longer fertile.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The UroLift System is a new option that can be done under local anaesthetic. Two to four pairs of what are effectively treasury tags are used to pull back the enlarged tissue, improving flow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The procedure seems to be effective, but no more so than TURP, and there are questions about how long the effects might last as we don’t yet have enough long-term studies to know.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">The most common procedure is transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), a keyhole procedure where a wire is inserted into the urethra then heated to burn away some of the enlarged gland</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also the treasury tags are, in part, metallic, which may distort the signal in MRI imaging should that be needed in the future, for example to diagnose prostate cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">PAE is another new procedure (first used in the UK in 2012) that must be regarded as experimental until we see the results of large studies — and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence approves it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, the prostate is shrunk by using microscopic particles to block the blood vessels supplying it. It’s done by feeding a catheter up through the main artery in the groin under local anaesthetic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I think you will guess the option I’d prefer if I were in your shoes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>When I was a child, I had Raynaud’s disease. It improved in my teens, but now I’m 73 it’s back with vengeance. I also have fibromyalgia.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="health-ccox"><strong>I’ve been told by doctors the drugs for Raynaud’s are worse than the symptoms. I’ve read they can cause a flushing face and headaches.</strong></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="health-ccox">The Raynaud’s affects my hands, feet, ears and back, and even when I’m indoors with the heating on I need to wear two vests, shirts, a long-sleeve pullover and a woolly-lined jacket. To crown it all, if I get too cold in bed the pain gets worse, but it also worsens if I get too hot.</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>A. Cartrill, Ipswich, Suffolk.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Raynaud’s is a disorder where some of the blood vessels have an exaggerated response to cold conditions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The vessels in the skin help control body temperature: the arteries dilate when it’s hot for warmth to be lost, and constrict in response to cold to minimise heat loss. However, those with Raynaud’s react to even minimal cooling; muscles in their small arteries spasm, temporarily blocking blood flow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Typically, it’s the arteries of the fingers, toes and other extremities that are affected. It can cause considerable discomfort when blood flow restarts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The body’s temperature is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system (the fight or flight part), which explains why stress, as well as cold conditions, can cause symptoms. Raynaud’s is usually linked to an underlying disease. However, in 5 per cent of cases, there’s no obvious cause and it’s probably genetic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Secondary Raynaud’s, as the most common form is known, typically occurs with autoimmune rheumatic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As there is no known association with fibromyalgia, I do wonder whether, given your history, this diagnosis is correct? Could it be that you have an associated rheumatic disorder, especially as your Raynaud’s symptoms appear to be quite severe?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Attacks can be reduced by dressing warmly, wearing gloves, avoiding smoking (nicotine causes arteries to constrict) and keeping clear of medicines that cause blood vessels to constrict, such as cough decongestants.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m not so convinced that medications for severe Raynaud’s are worse than the condition, though there is a balance to be struck.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Drug treatments include nitroglycerin ointment, high blood pressure medications (e.g. losartan), sildenafil (also known as Viagra) and antidepressants such as fluoxetine (known as Prozac). These work by dilating blood vessels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My policy has been to treat patients who have severe recurrent symptoms with blood pressure drugs called calcium channel blockers — nifedipine or felodipine — at the lowest effective dose to avoid causing low blood pressure, which would result in feeling faint.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other potential side-effects are headache, flushing, ankle swelling and an increase in heart rate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Randomised trials have shown this approach appears to be modestly effective.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox news" data-version="2" id="mol-06f93460-3150-11e8-8c57-f5005e365bd4">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Never skimp on sleep </h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you needed more confirmation of the importance of a decent amount of sleep, how about the emerging evidence that our dreaming may help take the emotional sting out of memories — thus reducing the anxiety of bad experiences?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One early U.S. study found that women who had bad dreams about their divorce were less likely to be depressed a year later than those who didn’t report such dreams.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We get more of this (largely REM) ‘healing’ sleep later on in the night, between six to eight hours after nodding off.

Don't be complacent about jabs </h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">We forget too easily the huge impact vaccines have had on our lives. I was reminded of this during the recent cold spell, when two senior ladies — one aged 89, the other 91 — came over for afternoon tea in front of a blazing log fire.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The younger of my visitors has been troubled with a severe and worsening cough for some years. She was eventually diagnosed with bronchiectasis, where the airways become enlarged and blocked with sputum.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s linked to lung damage from a number of causes, but in this patient’s case it was whooping cough as a child. Whooping cough is a highly contagious infection caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. It can be dangerous for the very young and, until a vaccine became available, it claimed many lives — 3,000 children in the UK in 1941 alone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This led to what now seem rather desperate measures. At the time it was noted that children living close to gasworks had a lower incidence of the disease and it was thought that the vapours might be therapeutic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My visitor with the cough said she clearly remembered being taken for a visit to the local gasworks in the early Thirties. And my other visitor described her own visit to a gasworks in early childhood for the same reason.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Such history reminds us of the great value of childhood immunisation programmes, which commenced shortly after the NHS was created in 1948.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But we must not be complacent about this disease. Indeed, as the protection from childhood fades over time, some adults may suffer a mild version of whooping cough (characterised by coughing lasting weeks or months after a minor flu-like illness).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it remains dangerous for babies. As the vaccines aren’t offered until children are six weeks old, their mothers are advised to have the vaccine during pregnancy so their protective antibodies can cross the placenta. Please do take up the offer.</p></div></div><div class="art-ins mol-factbox news" data-version="2" id="mol-b68046b0-3143-11e8-8c57-f5005e365bd4">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Why I'm worried about.... </h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">The failure to teach doctors about nutrition.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A recent U.S. study found that almost half of all deaths from heart disease, stroke and diabetes are linked to the food we eat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Good nutrition can be vital for patients recovering from surgery and disease.

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">The Daily Mail’s petition demanding Britain’s post-Brexit blue passports be made in the UK raced past the 150,000 mark last night</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, while many Labour politicians have backed the plan to keep producing the passports in Britain, former leader Tony Blair last night sneered at their ‘false patriotism’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Home Office says it will save £120million over the course of the contract by choosing Gemalto. But industry insiders believe the cost to taxpayers in lost tax revenues could be up to £36million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This figure includes the loss if the De La Rue workers facing redundancy were unable to find new jobs. It is believed the knock-on effect could cost the economy in the North-East – a region with the highest unemployment rate in the country – millions more.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Mail asked the Home Office if a fiscal impact assessment had taken place but a spokesman declined to answer. It is understood it could cost up to another £30million in ‘transition’ costs, as ‘dual operation’ takes place while production switches from one company to another.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Around 200 posts at the Gateshead plant are at risk and more jobs face the axe in De La Rue’s extended supply chain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sources said De La Rue – which holds the current £490million contract – bid millions less for the contract this time around after identifying where it could make efficiency savings. It puts Gemalto’s bid at as low as £320million. The source said industry figures were struggling to understand how the contract could be ‘commercially viable’ and deliver quality of service with such a low bid.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the Commons yesterday shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the Government could not be ‘allowed to hide behind EU procurement rules’, adding ministers must ‘take responsibility for the potential fallout this may have on workers, their families, the community and their wider industrial strategy’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Labour’s John Spellar demanded Mrs May perform a U-turn, saying she should follow the example of other governments who ‘look after their own industries’. Germany, France, and Spain all award passport contracts to domestic firms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tory MPs also criticised the Government’s decision.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An urgent question was raised by Labour’s Liz Twist – whose Blaydon constituency includes a De La Rue factory – in which she asked Miss Nokes about the security implications of a non-UK company making British passports. Miss Nokes said all passports will continue to have personal data added to them in the UK, saying ‘robust processes established over a number of years’ have determined that manufacturing passports overseas ‘presents no security concerns’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She added there was ‘no place for sentimentalism’ when deciding contracts, saying: ‘I am as sorry as anybody that we do not have a British company at the top of this process, but the reality is that, as a minister, I have to reflect on value for money, quality and security.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs May vowed to press on with the plan to hand the passport contracts to Gemalto.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She told MPs she would not step in because her Government believed in ‘competition and open markets’, adding: ‘Those who say passports can only be produced in their own country would be denying De La Rue a significant amount of their business.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Weighing in on the row last night, a sneering Mr Blair said it was a ‘perfectly formed example of how we have fallen as a nation into the vice of a false patriotism’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We want to change them from magenta to blue and it appears that it is a Franco-Dutch company which has won the contract for the new passports.
