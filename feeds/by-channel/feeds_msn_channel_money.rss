One would be to take a quarter up front as a tax free lump sum with the rest going into a drawdown account from which withdrawals would be taxable.</p><div class="mol-img-group floatRHS" style="style">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Steve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The other would be to move the whole amount into a drawdown account and then each withdrawal would be a mix of taxable and tax-free.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The advantages and disadvantages of each would depend on things like how much other taxable income you had at the same time and whether you were likely to want to put any money *into* a pension once you had started drawing out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can read more about the different sorts of drawdown accounts on<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk/en"> the PensionWise website.</a></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The crucial point about a drawdown account is that you can choose how quickly to take the money out. In principle, you could take relatively large amounts each year with the intention of running it down over a ten year period.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, you should bear in mind that the money in the drawdown account is being invested and could itself go up or down. You can choose whether to invest cautiously so that the money doesn’t grow much but probably won’t go down either, or by taking a higher risk so that your money might grow faster but where there is probably more risk of it going down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As an alternative to going into drawdown, you could use your first pension to buy a fixed term annuity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You could use all of your pot or take a tax free lump sum and use three quarters of your pot. The annuity could provide you a guaranteed income for ten years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As with the money you take out of a drawdown account, the income from the annuity would be taxable.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">If your first pension is an older style final salary or ‘defined benefit’ pension then the situation is a bit more complex.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These pensions were originally designed to give you a guaranteed pension for life rather than to be run down over a shorter period.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, provided your final salary pension is from a private firm and has a pension fund sitting behind it, you should have the option to exchange it for a lump sum.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You would ask your scheme for something called a ‘cash equivalent transfer value’ which is an amount they would give you in exchange for giving up your rights under the scheme.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the lump sum is worth more than £30,000 you would be obliged to take financial advice (for which you would have to pay) about whether or not to transfer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is very much an individual decision, based on your own needs and circumstances, but regulators say that people should generally assume that holding on to a guaranteed income for life is likely to be the right answer for most people.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS money" data-version="2" id="mol-04dcf7b0-2db9-11e8-8621-e7ba05b68122">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Should you take your 25% tax-free pension lump sum? </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">The chance to pocket a tax-free 25 per cent lump sum from your retirement fund when you stop working is one of the most popular perks of saving into a pension, but there are reasons for and against doing this. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/pensions/article-4633368/Should-25-tax-free-pension-lump-sum.html">Read a This is Money guide here.</a> </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you did do a transfer of this sort you would then have the same options as mentioned earlier for a ‘pot of money’ pension, in terms of running it down quickly until other pensions start to be paid. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What other issues should you consider?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here are a few other things to think about before making your decision.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1) I’m assuming that you want to draw a pension at 60 and live on it so that you can retire.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But if you have a job and are fit and able to do it, you might find that your standard of living in retirement would be better if you carried on working for a bit longer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s obviously up to you, but the longer you work, the bigger pension you are likely to get, including a pension contributions from your employer, and the better standard of living you could have in retirement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2) The other thing to think about is income tax. Each year you can have a certain amount of income from earnings, pensions and so on before you have to pay income tax. Currently the tax-free allowance is £11,500.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would make sense to think about the profile of your income from your different pensions to make sure that there are not years when you are ‘wasting’ part of this annual tax free allowance.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS money" data-version="2" id="mol-de3dbae0-2db8-11e8-8621-e7ba05b68122">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">How much can you save into a pension after starting withdrawals? </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Over-55s who dip into their defined contribution pensions are only able to put away £4,000 a year and still automatically qualify for tax relief. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/pensions/article-4693504/Delayed-cut-pension-tax-relief-on.html">Read more here.</a> </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, if you took £10,500 one year and £12,500 the next, you would pay more tax than if you took £11,500 in each year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">3) I also touched on whether you might want to put more money into a pension once you had started drawing out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If your first pension is a 'defined contribution' pot, once you start drawing on it you will only be able to put away £4,000 a year and still qualify for tax relief on these payments, rather than £40,000 a year as before.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This could limit your ability to boost your pension pot in future if you want and can afford to do so.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">4) One final thing to bear in mind is that people tend to under-estimate how long they will live. It may seem like a good idea to draw down your first pension in full while you are in your sixties but you obviously then won’t have any of that money in your eighties or beyond.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You should think about what your spending needs are likely to be in retirement (including cash for things like repairing your house or replacing your car) and be sure that these would be covered just by your state pension and other private pension. </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-102cc6d0-d7f8-11e6-84ad-2feb9f076e0a">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title"><span class="mol-style-small">ASK STEVE WEBB A PENSION QUESTION </span></h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Former Pensions Minister Steve Webb is This Is Money's Agony Uncle.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He is ready to answer your questions, whether you are still saving, in the process of stopping work, or juggling your finances in retirement.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Since leaving the Department of Work and Pensions after the May 2015 election, Steve has joined pension firm Royal London as director of policy.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you would like to ask Steve a question about pensions, please email him at <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="mailto:pensionquestions@thisismoney.co.uk">pensionquestions@thisismoney.co.uk</a>.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Steve will do his best to reply to your message in a forthcoming column, but he won't be able to answer everyone or correspond privately with readers. Nothing in his replies constitutes regulated financial advice.

FIX FOR LONGER</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you still haven't fixed your mortgage rate, get your skates on. Banks and building societies have already started pulling their best deals as rate hikes loom.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some three million people are paying their lender's standard variable rate (SVR) — the rate to which a mortgage reverts at the end of a fixed deal — which currently averages 4.76 per cent. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some are as high as 5.99 per cent, according to data firm Moneyfacts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By comparison, you can get a cheap fixed deal for as little as 1.24 per cent. That's the best two-year rate, from Yorkshire Building Society.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">
    <img id="i-a93135eee00037e1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/25/20/04D456E6000007D0-5542507-image-a-1_1522006521851.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="Going fast: Banks and building societies have already started pulling their best deals as rate hikes loom" class="blkBorder img-share" />
  </div>

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Going fast: Banks and building societies have already started pulling their best deals as rate hikes loom</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fixing your loan gives you the peace of mind that for two, five or even ten years, your repayments won't change.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For most people, five-year fixed rates are the way to go. That saves you having to find yet another new deal in a couple of years, when interest rates could still be climbing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, on a £150,000 mortgage taken out over 25 years, monthly repayments at 4.8 per cent would be £859.50. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By switching to the lowest five-year fixed rate from HSBC, at 1.71 per cent, repayments would be slashed to £614.82 — a saving of £244.68 a month or £2,936.16 a year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-small">2. RESERVE A RATE</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It may be that you're nervously waiting to lock in to a fixed rate because your current deal hasn't expired. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most fixed mortgages have early repayment charges that are triggered if you remortgage before the end of the term. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These can be as high as 7 per cent of the loan value, or £10,500 on a £150,000 mortgage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But few people realise that you can lock in to a top rate months in advance. Mortgage offers are typically valid for three to six months — so bag a rate now before deals get more expensive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Offers from NatWest, Yorkshire Building Society and Bank of Ireland are valid for six months. At Nationwide, purchase offers are valid for 180 days, but those on remortgages stand for 90 days.</p><div class="mol-img-group floatRHS">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Unlock it: It could work out cost-effective to swallow an early repayment charge</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-small">3. PAY TO EXIT DEAL</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even if your deal has longer to run, it could still work out cost-effective to swallow the early repayment charge and switch to a low rate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Early repayment charges vary according to lender and mortgage size. Check your paperwork for how much you'll have to pay, then see whether the savings from your new deal can beat that figure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-small">4. REDUCE LOAN</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When interest rates and returns on savings are low, it makes sense to plough money into paying your biggest debt — your mortgage. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Say you have a £150,000 25-year mortgage at 3 per cent. Overpaying by £50 a month would mean your loan is paid off two years and three months early, saving you £6,548 in interest, according to broker London &amp; Country.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most mortgages typically allow you to overpay 10 per cent of the balance each year without penalty.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-small">5. OFFSET THE DEBT</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some lenders allow you to merge your savings with your mortgage account via a so-called offset mortgage. You only pay interest on the sum of your loan minus your savings balance.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, if you had £10,000 in savings and offset it against a £150,000 loan, you'd pay interest on £140.000. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On a 25-year mortgage at 3 per cent, this would save £10,426 in interest and pay off the mortgage 13 months early, according to L&amp;C.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The bigger your savings pot, the more money you save — and the quicker you pay off the loan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Offsetting £20,000 would save £19,486 and shave two years and two months off the term.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And with most deals, you retain instant access to your savings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-small">6. BOOST DEPOSIT</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The cheapest mortgages are reserved for those with the largest amount of equity in their homes. This is because the bank sees you as a lower risk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, if you can stump up a 20 per cent deposit, you'll get a better rate than with only 10 per cent.</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

You need to factor in all the charges. Some low rates come with eye-watering arrangement fees.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have a smaller mortgage, then it can actually work out cheaper to plump for a deal with a higher rate and a low fee.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mark Harris, of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, says the tipping point in the following example is £125,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For instance, if you took a two-year fix from HSBC at 1.89 per cent with no fee, you would pay £4,725 in interest over the two years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If instead you took HSBC's 1.49 per cent two-year fix, which has a £999 fee, you would pay £3,725 interest over the same period. When you add the £999 fee, that takes you to £4,724, making it a better deal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The numbers will be different depending on the deal you select.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The clock is ticking for homeowners.

Research shows painting your front door can actually help with a sale. Clearing the front garden is also essential.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Stage your home: </strong>Years ago, you could get away with a quick tidy-up, a lick of paint and the smell of fresh bread.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today, sellers even 'dress' a property before putting it on the market, and even redecorating might be worth it if you get a better price.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Be honest: </strong>Tell the truth about work that needs to be done in your home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the property needs updating, then it's fine to market it as unmodernised. You'll then attract the right kind of buyer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Top performers: </strong>Visit <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://getagent.co.uk/">GetAgent.co.uk</a>, a comparison website looking at which agents get the best prices in the quickest times. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Register and type in your postcode. GetAgent analyses the volume of properties the agent has sold, the length of time on the market and sold price for homes in your area.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Reduce estate agent fees: </strong>Never accept the first quote and don't be afraid to haggle — many agents will cut fees, rather than lose your business.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Estate agency fees for selling a property can be anywhere between 1 per cent and 2 per cent. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even at 1.5 per cent, selling an average four-bedroom family home worth £450,000 would set you back £6,750 plus VAT, making it £8,100.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sell your home DIY-style: </strong>You could sidestep using a traditional estate agent and market your property yourself online. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Using Purplebricks, HouseSimple, Emoov or Tepilo, you pay a one-off fee and save thousands of pounds — if your home sells.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The sites offer internet marketing of homes for a flat fee of anything up to £1,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are many no-frills services. 99Home is one of the latest online estate agencies, where a fee of £99 gets your home listed on Zoopla, PrimeLocation and Rightmove.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/mortgageshome/article-4599684/How-best-online-estate-agent.html">&gt; Read our guide to the best online estate agents </a></p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

Prove it: </strong>If you are fortunate to be able to buy a home without any borrowing, provide the agent with proof of these funds.

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Estate agency fees for selling a property can be  between 1 per cent and 2 per cent</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Use the internet: </strong>There are a number of popular tools on Zoopla, including <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://zoopla.co.uk/smartmap">SmartMaps</a>, which allows you to search specifically where you want to buy by editing area boundaries. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://zoopla.co.uk/travel-time">Travel Time</a> lets you find homes based on travel time to important points such as your workplace, a school or a family member's home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The keyword search narrows specifics for the type of property you are looking for, such as cottage, garage, parking or garden.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Hire a buying agent: </strong>Buying agencies are not only for the wealthy, and they can often save you more than they charge, which is usually around 3 per cent of the asking price. They will search for a property according to your specifications and can help with price negotiations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Look beyond your price range: </strong>Search for properties slightly above your price category to see what a little more will buy you. More importantly, you can keep an eye on those out of your reach in case they are reduced.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Don't believe everything you read:</strong> Estate agents can get things wrong. Double-check particulars such as the length of lease if a property is leasehold, and planning permissions where it claims some have been granted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Do some detective work:</strong> If you're buying in a new area, do research on the neighbourhood. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can't always rely on what the vendor or their agent tells you about the neighbours. Visit the area at different times and chat to locals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Meet the owners: </strong>Find an excuse to meet the owners when you are making an offer on a property, as they will often feel more obliged to sell to you. Once a seller has got to know you, they are far less likely to act ruthlessly.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Investigate the auction room: </strong>Auctions are a great source of renovation projects if you want a challenge. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But not all homes at auction are in a state of disrepair. Around 4,000 lots went under the hammer in February, according to Essential Information Group, which tracks the results of UK property auctions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's important to prepare properly before you set foot in an auction room.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Auctions require a 10 per cent deposit on the day and you are legally bound to buy the property.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You'll usually have to pay and complete within 28 days. If you back out, you lose the deposit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Offer the right price: </strong>Find out what the owners paid for the property. Zoopla and Rightmove have details, or search on the 'price paid data' section of the Land Registry website.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Compare this to the asking price today. The larger the margin, the more room there is for negotiation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>New builds:</strong> New builds are a good place to spot a bargain if period features aren't on your must-have list, according to Sarah Beeny of online estate agent Tepilo. 'Many developers just want to shift stock and so, if a development has lots for sale, they may take an offer,' she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Find a bargain: </strong>What counts as a 'bargain' will differ in every postcode.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whatever type of property is in surplus in a particular area is where you will find the best deals.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-cf800100-30d5-11e8-b37c-61463c6790cd">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Does buy-to-let still stack up? </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">My property is my pension.

Downsized engines, hybrid powertrains, regenerative power systems - they really are testing the boundaries of the technology that governments will force all motorists to use in the next few years. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And the Honda NSX shares more ingredients with F1 cars of 2018 than any other thrill-seeking model on the market. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here's my argument. Like the Formula One prototypes, it uses a turbocharged V6 petrol engine. However, at 3.5 litres, it's more than twice the size of the 1600cc capacity motors used by Red Bull Racing, Force India and the rest. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just like high-profile names such as Alonso, Raikonnen and Verstappen, NSX drivers will have the motor wedged just inches from their ear, with the six-cylinder lump dropped as close to the centre of the car as possible, just behind the backrest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Honda has also decided to follow the footsteps of F1 into the fiendishly complicated world of electrified hybrid performance, while the supercar fraternity has tended to play it safe with conventional petrol-only powerplants.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it hasn't scrimped on the supplementary kilowatts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are two electric motors up front - one powering each of the front wheels - and a third bolted between the engine and the nine-speed transmission, which is one gear more than F1 rules stipulate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's not short of power as a result. With 573bhp when all power sources are active, it's more potent than a Lamborghini Huracan or Porsche 911 Turbo S.</p><div class="mol-img-group xwArtSplitter">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Not many supercars on the market today can glide through town without emitting a single pollutant and then thrash through the countryside at apoplectic pace</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Find an open stretch of road, work your way through the remaining driving settings - from Sport to Sport Plus and Track - and the Honda quickly reaffirms that it's by no means a planet-saving eco warrior; this is a full-blooded weapon designed for the most enthusiastic of petrolheads.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Right off the bat in Sport mode, the NSX is devilishly quick. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even with a relatively tubby (by supercar standards) 1,776kg kerb weight - due to the batteries and motors - any fears that it might feel too cumbersome for a proper performance car soon disappeared, as the back of my head was abruptly buried into the sports seats at the first gutsy dab of the throttle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With the surge of momentum comes a lovably raucous engine note - even if it might be missing a couple of cylinders for some supercar traditionalists - and the short barks of revs on downshifts through the gearbox are utterly addictive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It even stops better than I imagined. Okay, it's fitted with £8,400 optional carbon ceramic brakes, but they're linked to a regenerative energy system to replenish the small battery for the electric motors - and if you've ever driven a Toyota Prius, you'll know that this can make the stop pedal turn into a Victoria Sponge. Not in the NSX. It's sharp and full of feel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But that's not the most impressive characteristic of the hyper-powered Honda.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What's more flabbergasting is how it holds a corner at speed without a stutter or hint of struggle. You won't know it but the onboard computer is working tirelessly in the background, as it calculates how to handle that fast-approaching curve and deposit you safely at the other end. And all the while it doesn't feel synthetic or aided. In fact, it feels mechanical and hugely involving.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While it almost certainly never is the case, you, the driver, feel utterly responsible for each perfectly taken turn, and that's a bigger testament to Honda than the cornering speed itself.</p><div class="mol-img-group xwArtSplitter">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Ride quality - even by supercar standards - is harsh. Tuned on silky US highways, you'll feel just about every foible in the British tarmac </p></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">It's flawless then, right?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unfortunately, it's not quite the finished article, for three main reasons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Firstly, the ride is punishing, even by supercar standards. This is mostly due to the suspension compliance being mastered on US roads (where it's called the Acura NSX) and therefore far too rigid for the UK's pothole-riddled routes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The next issue is the dinky 1.3 kilowatt battery for the three electrified motors. It simply doesn't provide  electric power for long enough installments. This might sounds like a moot point for a near-600bhp powerhouse designed to tear up tarmac rather than glide over it mutely, but there's no denying that it impresses when cruised silently through town as much as it does when you're rampaging through the countryside.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The final flaw is the interior. Has it been lifted from a £20,000 Civic hatchback? Not entirely, but that infotainment system certainly has, and it's way too crude for a car that is a mechanical masterpiece. If it was my £180,000, I'd feel short-changed by the cabin finish.</p><div class="mol-img-group xwArtSplitter"><div class="splitLeft"><div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

Instead, it has triumphed by exploiting the arsenal of new weaponry it had to utilise and created a model that feels as special at 5mph in electric mode as it does at 185mph with the V6 singing at full chorus.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you can afford it should you buy one instead of a Ferrari or McLaren? Plenty will argue not. But I guarantee that if you do choose the NSX, each time you get out of it you'll marvel at how it just took you on that journey, no matter what speed it was travelled at.<br /></p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-ccf083e0-30d2-11e8-814f-25a8acb35c12">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">HONDA NSX: FACTS AND FIGURES </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><div class="cleared row mol-cols mol-cols-2" id="mol-77f97fc0-30d4-11e8-814f-25a8acb35c12">                            <div class="mol-col span6 mol-col-1">                                <div class="cleared mol-col-content">                                    <p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Basic price:</strong> £149,950</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Price on test:</strong> £180,250</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Optional extras:</strong> Andaro Paint (£4,800), Carbon Fibre Exterior Sport Pack (£7,100), Carbon Fibre Engine Cover (£2,900), Carbon Ceramic brakes (£8,400), Carbon Fibre Interior pack (£2,300), Garmin Nav (£1,700), Heated power adjustable sports seats (£2,000), Alcantara headlining (£1,100)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Engine:</strong> Twin-turbo 2.5-litre V6 petrol</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Power unit:</strong> Front twin motors, rear direct drive motor</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Maximum power:</strong> 573bhp  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Top speed: </strong>191mph</p>                                </div>                            </div><div class="mol-col span6 mol-col-2">                                <div class="cleared mol-col-content">                                    <p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Transmission:</strong> 9 speed semi automatic </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Length:</strong> 4,487mm</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Width:</strong> 2,217mm (including mirrors)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Height:</strong> 1,204mm</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Wheelbase:</strong> 2,630mm</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Kerb weight:</strong> 1,776kg - 1,814kg </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Seats:</strong> 2</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Fuel tank:</strong> 59 litres</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 24mpg</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>CO2 emissions:</strong> 228g/km</p>                                </div>                            </div>                        </div>                            </div>                        </div><div class="moduleFull"><div class="money item">

</div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>It's one of the most overused expressions in motoring journalism: 'It's like an F1 car for the road.' Used to describe just about any new model with more horse power than the Grand National and a price that's on a par with a modest-sized property, it's an easy link to make. But Honda's NSX really is the closest thing to the current F1 cars you can have on the road today. Powered by a hybrid V6 engine, as an F1 car is, it's one of few supercars to adopt electric power. So, what's it like to drive? We spent a week with one to find out.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Rob Hull</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-03-26T17:53:29.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>We drive Honda's F1 car for the road - the £150k NSX supercar</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-03-26T17:53:29.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/cars/article-5491861/How-super-rich-finance-supercars.html" title="A £600,000 deposit, monthly payments of £26,000 and £1.8M to pay at the end - how the mega-rich finance the most exclusive supercars"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/cars/article-5504899/Honda-making-135mph-lawnmower.html" title="Honda reveals its new model that produces 189bhp and has a top speed of 135mph - and it's a LAWNMOWER"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/cars/article-5495633/This-Range-Rover-sets-record-time-deadly-mountain-road-China.html" title="The Range Rover that's faster than a supercar: 4x4 obliterates the record time set by a Ferrari for racing up one of the deadliest roads known to man"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/cars/article-5483187/Morgans-144-000-Aero-GT-revealed-Geneva-Motor-Show.html" title="Cheerio old chap!

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the wake of the accident, you had the presence of mind to photograph the door. On the outside nothing warned passengers not to stand in front of it. On the inside nothing instructed the crew that it was only to be used as an emergency exit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But soon after the accident, signs appeared. On deck the sign warned passengers not to block what was a fire exit. On the inside a fresh sign was put up, telling crew members that the door was only to be opened in an emergency.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is hard to see this as anything other than an open and shut case. But when your solicitor asked TUI for the name of its insurer, and suggested that if TUI did not hand over copies of its records about the accident then he would take the matter to court, the shutters came down.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">When your solicitor tried to file a county court claim on your wife’s behalf, TUI told him he must go to the specialist Admiralty Court. At this point, as costs mounted, you and your wife halted legal action.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But when I invited TUI to comment, I was told: ‘As we understand this matter is now the subject of legal proceedings, it would be inappropriate to comment at this time.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I told TUI repeatedly that there are no legal proceedings and I asked time and again for details of the court and case number. Eventually, TUI told me there had been ‘a degree of confusion’. When the cruise company referred to legal proceedings, all it meant was that it had heard from your solicitor.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But you no longer have a solicitor. You had to back out because he warned you of the need to pay for a specialist barrister. Your letter to The Mail on Sunday made this clear.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sadly, TUI has proved completely unwilling to discuss the accident. It has been trying to persuade me to question your former solicitor on points of legal procedure, instead of looking into why the smoking area was set up right outside a heavy metal door, why there were no warning signs on the door and what TUI could do to help a passenger who was injured on one of its cruise ships.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Absurdly, at this late stage TUI told me that any claim could be started in the Admiralty Court and then be transferred to the far cheaper county court. So why not say this in the first place?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even worse, at no point did TUI tell you, or me, or your solicitor about the even cheaper conciliation scheme run by the Association of British Travel Agents. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman explained: ‘This conciliation scheme is a simple and cost-effective means for ABTA members and their customers to resolve personal injury claims for awards of up to £10,000 without the need to go to court.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have sent you details of the ABTA scheme. But TUI’s attitude throughout makes me wonder whether passengers on its ships should not just take out travel insurance.

Normally, banks release funeral costs without any problem and a joint account would pass to the surviving signatory, again without any problem.

Which shares should I pick? When should I buy and sell?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Do not panic. You can beat all these potential pitfalls with a simple trick. It's used by all the pros and if you follow the rules, you'll not go far wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The secret is this: invest regularly in a range of funds managed by a stock-picker with proven expertise and ignore the ups and downs in the market. Here we explain the method in three simple steps.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>STEP 1</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Work out how much you have in savings, what you can afford to put aside and how long you're investing for. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you don't feel you can invest the money for at least five years — or can't face the prospect of being left with less than you started with — investing isn't for you. You'll find heaps of information about less risky savings accounts on the following pages.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-e7052b60-313a-11e8-af5c-83ad6218be5b">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">The funds you must dump now </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Tinkering too much with your investments is never a good idea. The experts say you are likely to do more harm than good by chopping and changing your fund selections every year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But keep an eye out for serial under-performers — and be ruthless when the time comes.

Trying to time the market is almost always a mistake.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fidelity estimates someone who invested £1,000 in the FTSE All Share 30 years ago but missed the ten top-performing days because of bad investment decisions would now have £7,215.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But if you had just left your money in the stock market the entire time it would have grown to £13,491.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having a regular plan means you still invest money when the market falls, so you buy more shares when they are cheap and fewer when they are more expensive, which boosts returns long-term.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS money" data-version="2" id="mol-e24f1d60-313a-11e8-af5c-83ad6218be5b">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Tax free allowance to be cut from April 6</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">From April 6 the amount you can earn tax-free from share dividends will be cut from £5,000 to £2,000. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any income above that will be taxed at 7.5 per cent for basic-rate payers and 32.5 per cent and 38.1 per cent, respectively, for higher- and additional-rate payers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can avoid the tax by investing up to £20,000 through a stocks and shares Isa, where the income and returns you make are tax-free. </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>STEP 3</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now you need to work out which funds will receive your hard-earned cash.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Spread your investment across funds which specialise in different countries and assets. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The benefit of this strategy is that if one fund takes a hit, the performance of the others should compensate for it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It may not always seem like it, but markets typically go up around three-quarters of the time, so if you have money in different markets across the world they are not likely to rise and fall in tandem.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For investors who don't like the idea of swings in the value of their savings, Adrian Lowcock, of advisers Architas, tips the Fidelity Moneybuilder Dividend fund.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It invests in giant UK companies such as HSBC, drugs maker GlaxoSmithKline and insurer Legal &amp; General, and has turned £10,000 into £10,620 in three years.

This is to avoid you having to switch your account too often when short-term bonuses run out.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If there is a restriction on withdrawals we have made this clear in the notes on each account.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">We also ignore old-style 'notice' accounts where the bank or building society can demand you give up to six months' notice that you want to take our money out while it can change the rate at any time without warning.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">All banks and building societies are registered with the Financial Services Authority and signed up to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, either directly (protecting up to £85,000) or via its passport scheme (where the compensation limit depends on the bank's home country.

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">The days when M&amp;S was admired for its terrific recruitment and culture are gone, as it brings in expertise from rivals</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The shares, languishing at or near to a 12-month low, do not as yet show great confidence in the future.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rowe's policy is to focus on the UK and end the distraction of being overseas. Other retailers Primark and JD Sports take the opposite approach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Under McDonald's shake-up, womenswear and kidswear are merged under a single team with Jill Stanton, a veteran of Next and Nike, in charge. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">No one disputes retailing genius at Next, which continues to exploit its digital skills to the full, but its fashion genius is less established.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As part of the shake-up, fashion guru Belinda Earl, once chief executive at Debenhams, has been given the prize of library prefect at the M&amp;S archive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">McDonald assures everyone: 'M&amp;S clothing is transforming. We're crystal clear on the challenge.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The company wants to become more relevant to more people.

Given that Bushveld estimates that the addressable market in Africa could be worth between $25billion and $30billion, that’s quite some undertaking.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it also makes clear why Nikomarov’s plans to make Bushveld Energy a much more significant company inside the Bushveld stable could really come to something.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nikomarov is certainly a believer.

It ensures that both sides are motivated, and that Nikomarov is likely to be rewarded if he makes good on his ambition.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘My ambition is to make Bushveld Energy the most important part of the business,’ he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It may never have 450 people in it as the vanadium mine does – it’s not that labour or capital intensive.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>LEGACY OF CHAOS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A systems upgrade at Npower and ScottishPower back in 2013 led to billing chaos for hundreds of thousands of customers and ultimately led to the companies being fined £26million and £18million respectively.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With these suppliers working through a big backlog of errors and complaints it means some customers have faced uncertainty and worry for a long time. A proposed merger between Npower and rival SSE next year could spell further billing hell.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A victim of shock historic billing is 85-year-old Davina Cockcroft, whose account was one of many affected by Npower’s billing debacle. It has taken four years to rectify. </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">In December 2013, she received an electricity bill for nearly £2,000, covering a three- month period of usage at her home in Todmorden, Lancashire. The demand for money ruined Davina’s Christmas because she lived in fear of owing such a huge sum. She considered asking her brother for help but kept quiet because he was recovering from surgery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A baffling sequence of cancelled and amended bills ensued. Meter readers sent by Npower recorded the day and night-time figures for her Economy 7 meter the wrong way round, leading to miscalculations about what was owed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Only last year Davina was sent a bill for £1,024 along with 15 other amended bills going back to November 2012. None of the correspondence made sense to her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Devastated by the experience she turned to her brother, John Cockcroft, for help. But customer service shortfalls drained much of his time and energy, and that of his 45-year-old daughter Claire Scott, who tried to pitch in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Former engineer and physicist John, 79, says: ‘The complexity and ill-explained calculations on Npower’s amended bills has taxed my powers of comprehension to the limit and is also beyond my sister’s understanding.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Claire, who is a doctor, says employees were not able to explain how the bills were calculated when asked. She says: ‘When it came to unravelling the billing anomalies Npower was incompetent. Each conversation with customer services, when we requested an explanation of the latest bill, elicited either another revised bill without explanation or an incomprehensible statement of account.’</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

  </div>

</div>    <p class="imageCaption">Spotlight: Our 2016 story about Ofgem’s report into energy complaints</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Cockcrofts still believe Npower is using incorrect figures and have pointed this out to the company, even escalating it to the chief executive’s office, to little effect.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A statement of account shows huge swings between debit and credit, from Davina being in credit by a couple of thousand pounds to owing nearly £25,000. Multiple bills were produced and then quickly cancelled with alarming regularity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Claire says: ‘My father has always been meticulous with figures and has spent months analysing the bills, cross-checking day and night readings on bills going back to 2012 to get clarity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘How Npower dealt with my aunt’s account has been shambolic and heartbreaking to witness. The effect it has had on our entire family is unforgivable. But as we attempt to unpick its errors we are hopeful of preventing other elderly and vulnerable people going through the same ordeal.’ </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokeswoman for Npower says Davina’s account was ‘rebilled’ in 2014 because of the company’s mix-up with meter readings. She was then invoiced incorrectly. The account was only finally brought up to date last year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, Npower has refused to increase its compensation of £400 – from which it stingily deducted £31.64 that it calculated was left owing on the account.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The spokeswoman says: ‘We were so sorry to hear of the difficulties Davina and her family have experienced with her energy account. The problem is now sorted.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the family are furious about what they feel is a remorseless approach from Npower and they have now contacted the Energy Ombudsman.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">John adds: ‘Given the psychological anxiety and distress caused to my sister, Npower’s numerous erroneous calculations, a succession of amended bills – two of them major – and the pantomime of transposed meter readings, I feel the compensation offer of £400 is insulting.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">James Walker, founder of independent consumer help service Resolver, says change is long overdue. Data from the website shows people using the service to air energy-related grievances are far more likely to do so because of billing problems. The ‘vast majority’ relate to legacy bills.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Walker says: ‘Historic bills are almost always a result of miscalculations or complicated tariffs set by the firm. It can be a source of huge distress, especially for older people trying to get by on their own. The system needs to change.’</p><div class="artSplitter mol-img-group">    <div class="mol-img">  <div class="image-wrap">

</div><div class="clear"></div><p class="imageCaption">Business Secretary Greg Clark has weighed in to the Melrose offer for GKN</p></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Facing pressure by UK politicians to give assurances over the future of GKN, Melrose pledged to maintain GKN's UK listing and headquarters and to ensure that a majority of its directors are resident in the UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It also said it would spend at least 2.2 per cent of sales on research and development and pump £10million into GKN over five years to support the creation of between 100 and 150 new apprenticeships.   </p><div>

To feature in the best buys on variable rate accounts in our savings tables, an account must give you easy access to your money and come with no hidden catches.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In the past we have refused to include accounts where the rate is boosted by a short-term bonus or those with over-restrictive conditions so you only earn the advertised rate if you make three or less withdrawals a year.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But with interest rates so low, most of today's best deals have some sort of clause built in, whether that's a bonus or a restriction on withdrawals.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For that reason, we've included decent bonuses as long as they last for at least 12 months. This is to avoid you having to switch your account too often when short-term bonuses run out.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If there is a restriction on withdrawals we have made this clear in the notes on each account.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">We also ignore old-style 'notice' accounts where the bank or building society can demand you give up to six months' notice that you want to take our money out while it can change the rate at any time without warning.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">All banks and building societies are registered with the Financial Services Authority and signed up to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, either directly (protecting up to £85,000) or via its passport scheme (where the compensation limit depends on the bank's home country.
