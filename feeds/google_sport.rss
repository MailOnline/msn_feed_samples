With United winning all five matches played under Solskjaer so far, spirits have certainly been high during the week-long stay in the United Arab Emirates.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Adam Shergold for MailOnline</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-09T17:55:23.000+01:00</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Man United stars Sanchez, Lukaku and Matic in high spirits</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-09T17:55:23.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Premier League,Manchester United,Romelu lukaku,Alexis Sanchez</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/16/8319722-0-image-a-121_1547052916604.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6573639/Manchester-United-kids-including-Marcus-Rashford-celebrate-Dubai-training-camp.html" title="The kids are alright!

The England forward shared a video of himself feeding an enormous male lion some raw meat through a cage. Kane was enjoying a day out with his wife Kate and daughter Ivy when he was given the chance to feed the king of the jungle. The 25-year-old's hand was gripped by a park worker with the lion waiting inches away on the other side of the fence. It then rose up on it's hind legs, balancing the claws on the cage whilst Kane raised the food to the mouth and saw the meal swiftly devoured. </dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Will Griffee For Mailonline</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-09T17:39:59.000+01:00</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Harry Kane hand feeds lion some raw meat on family day out</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-09T17:39:59.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Harry Kane,Tottenham Hotspur</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/16/8318528-0-image-a-64_1547051252432.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6572767/Chelsea-fans-mad-Eden-Hazard-skill-Harry-Kane.html" title="‘I could watch this all day’: Chelsea fans go mad for Eden Hazard as he leaves Harry Kane on his backside with lightning quick footwork"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6571161/Best-No-9-world-Robbie-Keane-hails-Tottenham-star-Harry-Kane.html" title="'He's the best No 9 in the world': Robbie Keane hails Harry Kane as he backs him to stay at Tottenham and break the club's all-time goals record"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6570459/Tottenham-1-0-Chelsea-Advantage-Spurs-Kane-penalty.html" title="Tottenham 1-0 Chelsea: Harry Kane's VAR-assisted penalty gives Spurs first-leg advantage in Carabao Cup semi-final"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6570527/Tottenham-win-penalty-referee-Michael-Oliver-consults-VAR.html" title="Tottenham win penalty after referee Michael Oliver consults VAR over whether Harry Kane was offside before Kepa Arrizabalaga brought him down... but fans had no idea what was happening inside Wembley"></atom:link></item><item><title>Reading set to sign Lewis Baker on loan from Chelsea after midfielder was recalled from Leeds </title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6573887/Reading-set-sign-Lewis-Baker-loan-Chelsea.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2019 16:25:12 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6573887</guid><description><![CDATA[The Championship strugglers are looking to boost their chances of avoiding relegation and are progressing with a move for the former England Under 21 international.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

On Wednesday, United shared a photo of the day's 'winning team' from the final day of their training camp in Dubai, with goalkeeper David de Gea the only player over the age of 23. First team stars Marcus Rashford, 21, Scott McTominay, 22, Diogo Dalot, 19, and Andreas Pereira, 23, were also part of the victorious side, who were pictured celebrating after winning a mini tournament at Nad Al Sheba Sports Complex.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Joe Strange for MailOnline</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-09T17:29:40.000+01:00</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Manchester United kids celebrate during Dubai training camp</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-09T17:29:40.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Premier League,Marcus Rashford,Paul Pogba,Manchester United</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/15/8316774-0-image-a-65_1547048886846.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6573247/Michael-Carrick-says-happy-camp-Manchester-United-Ole-Gunnar-Solskjaer.html" title="'It's a happy camp... confidence, belief and almost a sense of calmness': Michael Carrick says Manchester United are on cloud nine after winning start under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6573147/Romero-lifts-lid-intense-training-United-goalkeepers-Dubai.html" title="Manchester United keeper Sergio Romero lifts lid on intense training complete with reaction drills and kicking as David de Gea and Co go through specialist sessions in Dubai"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6573013/Manchester-United-midfielder-Ethan-Hamilton-talks-Rochdale-possible-loan-move.html" title="Manchester United midfielder Ethan Hamilton in talks over Rochdale loan"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6572575/Eric-Bailly-joins-Jay-Zs-Roc-Nation-Sports-Man-United-defender-welcomed-Romelu-Lukaku.html" title="Eric Bailly joins Jay-Z’s Roc Nation Sports agency as Manchester United defender is welcomed by Romelu Lukaku and poses with New York Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia "></atom:link></item><item><title>Championship leaders Leeds face major selection crisis ahead of crunch clash with Derby with up to SEVEN first-team players ruled out</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6573569/Leeds-face-major-selection-crisis-ahead-Derby-clash-SEVEN-team-players-ruled-out.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2019 15:07:03 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6573569</guid><description><![CDATA[They could be missing up to seven first-team players for the match against Derby on Friday, with Pablo Hernandez a major doubt and Barry Douglas ruled out for the next two weeks.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

It seems Thorgan is open to a move but insisted he has pledged total focus to Monchengladbach until the end of the season.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Will Griffee For Mailonline</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-09T16:25:18.000+01:00</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Dortmund 'begin negotiations' for £38m winger Thorgan Hazard</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-09T16:25:18.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Borussia Dortmund,Transfer News</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/14/8313072-0-image-a-57_1547043187784.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>2073759</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Pixathlon/REX</mi:licensorName></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6572641/Bayern-Munich-chief-turns-heat-pursuit-Chelseas-Callum-Hudson-Odoi.html" title="'We like the player and we want to sign him': Bayern Munich chief lauds Callum Hudson-Odoi as Bundesliga giants turn up the heat in pursuit of Chelsea youngster after £35m bid"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6566695/Chelsea-new-boy-Chistian-Pulisic-coach-Maurizio-Sarri-contact.html" title="'I'll be really excited once the time comes': Chelsea new boy Chistian Pulisic and coach Maurizio Sarri yet to have contact after American sealed £57.7million move to Premier League"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6565805/Borussia-Dortmund-rival-Liverpool-Bayern-Munich-RB-Leipzig-striker-Timo-Werner.html" title="Borussia Dortmund 'to rival Liverpool and Bayern Munich' for RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner  "></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6572445/Will-Chelsea-starlet-Callum-Hudson-Odoi-impress-Bayern-Munich.html" title="Bayern Munich are desperate to make Chelsea starlet Callum Hudson-Odoi into the successor to Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery… so will we see another top English talent follow in Jadon Sancho's footsteps and become a hit in Germany?

October marked 20 years since Burton Albion chairman Ben Robinson gave Nigel his first opportunity in the dugout and though there have not been the trophies his dad lifted he has consistently achieved in his own way.</p><img id="i-5798feff0d3799f1" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8310830-6573081-image-a-71_1547038667765.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Former Nottingham Forest and Derby manager Brian Clough sits alongside a young Nigel " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">To guide Burton, whose average attendance hovers around 3,000 and whose record transfer fee stands at £500,000, into the Carabao Cup semi-finals requires an incredibly high standard of management. An even better milestone was keeping Burton in the Championship in 2016-17, fighting back week after week against clubs with vastly greater budgets and fan-bases.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clearly, the Clough magic has been passed from father to son and where some players or managers shy away from talking about their heritage for fear it overshadows their own careers, Nigel is more than happy to reflect. He does so with warmth and an understanding that his upbringing is of great interest to the public, and that it has shaped who he is.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aside from Burton, he maintained steady stewardship of Derby amid turbulent times, and led Sheffield United to semi-finals in both FA Cup and League Cup while a League One side.</p><img id="i-7f2cac929fe64400" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8310904-6573081-image-a-72_1547038752536.jpg" height="441" width="634" alt="Nigel celebrates after defeating Middlesbrough to reach the Carabao Cup semi-finals" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He masterminded a 0-0 draw against Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United in 2006 when Burton were a Conference team but this meeting with Manchester City presents an even bigger chasm because spending at the top has become that much more inflated. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Two legs facing Pep Guardiola's special side is a daunting prospect and victory once 180 minutes or more are done would represent one of the biggest shocks in the game's history.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nigel lifted this trophy twice as a player under his dad at Nottingham Forest and was a boy in the dressing room in 1978 when the club won it for the first time to spark a period of astonishing success. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, <span class="mol-style-italic">Sportsmail</span> looks at what kind of manager the younger Clough is and where his father's influence can be felt.</p><img id="i-be8264f45bce23cb" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/09/13/019501910000044D-6573081-image-m-74_1547038853782.jpg" height="447" width="634" alt="Brian lifts the First Division trophy with assistant Peter Taylor after winning the title in 1978" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>STYLE OF PLAY </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clough Snr's teams were renowned for attractive football. His Forest side attacked at speed and could pass their way through opponents too. So wedded to the beauty of the game was Clough that he famously, and fatally, told Leeds's title winners to throw their medals in the bin because they were not won fairly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It wasn't about winning, it was about the performance as well. It was standards,' Nigel says of his father in a Telegraph interview. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We played Oldham in the final [in 1990] and won 1-0 but we didn't play very well. We were in the next morning, running. We used to do lengths of the pitch – sides as we used to call them – and it was: "Go and do six sides." Seriously, that's what's happened the morning after the game. No balls to be seen.'</p><img id="i-8094f322afea02bd" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/09/13/0003D35200000C1D-6573081-image-a-88_1547039020752.jpg" height="449" width="634" alt="Nigel sits alongside dad Brian in the dugout during a Nottingham Forest game against QPR" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nigel has needed to be more pragmatic in his brand of football – Burton could not hope to out-skill technically better players – but he still commands a style based on thoughtfulness and creativity. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is athleticism in his side and patterns of play are readily visible. He coaches understanding between his players and resilience too. Even when competing regularly against teams with far bigger resources, Burton were only rarely beaten by big margins.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the United game 13 years ago Ferguson even penned a legal letter to back his counterpart in a subsequent court case. A drainage company was suing for payment despite leaving 40 tonnes of sand on the Pirelli Stadium pitch. A lawyer argued they were due a slice of Burton's £800,000 windfall for the replay because the poor surface had hindered United. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ferguson wrote that it was the way Nigel had prepared his players and nothing to do with the pitch. He said he was so fearful of an upset he brought on Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo with 30 minutes to go. Burton won the case.</p><img id="i-510b7406b4aa5724" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/09/13/0028FB2400000258-6573081-image-a-94_1547039238443.jpg" height="438" width="634" alt="Brian poses alongside ex-Liverpool star Nigel during a charity event in London in March, 2000" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>TRANSFER POLICY </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an interview with <span class="class"><span class="mol-style-italic"><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/sport/football/article-6566371/Burtons-charismatic-chairman-Ben-Robinson-looks-ahead-club-face-Man-City-League-Cup-semis.html">Sportsmail</a></span>, </span>Ben Robinson, Burton's 73-year-old chairman, explained the club's philosophy. Because balance sheets are tight, qualities searched for are not confined to the pitch. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Nigel's philosophy with signing players, like his dad, is that the character is important,' Robinson explains. 'We say, "If you come to Burton you'll get a manager who looks after his players, you'll get a club that cares for people as individuals. And you'll get a great training facility at St George's Park".'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example in 2017 Stephen Warnock, Jake Buxton, and John Brayford all arrived for free with Clough identifying their solid personalities, as well as football abilities, as beneficial to his squad. Even though Burton were subsequently relegated they staged a late season revival, winning three games in a row when the pressure was on, and that illustrated the mental strength within the group.</p><img id="i-8371f7fc65d2db24" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/09/13/00040AD100000C1D-6573081-image-a-97_1547039392795.jpg" height="523" width="634" alt="Brian shakes hands with Leeds chief Manny Cussins as Nigel and his brother Simon look on" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Burton's club record signing is £500,000 for Liam Boyce. To put that money into context, Clough Snr became the first to spend £1million way back in 1979, when taking Trevor Francis to Forest. Still, he made Francis wait for his debut – even sending him to make a round of brews – because no individual was bigger than the collective. That is a strategy Clough Jnr maintains.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Regarding his own transfers, only Forest in January 2017 have made an approach but Clough said no because the hierarchy at the time failed to appeal. 'People marvel at what Nigel has achieved. Maybe one day one of the big clubs will come in and good luck to them,' says Robinson.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>APPROACH TO PLAYERS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last April Colin Barrett relayed a story to <span class="mol-style-italic">Sportsmail</span> about Clough offering him an alcoholic drink before his debut. Barrett, a full back signed from City, declined and some 40 years on he mused that it was his new manager's way of testing him out. It is unlikely Clough JNr has tried the same tactic in his time but there are undeniable traces of that mischievous manner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like his dad, Nigel likes to get to know his players on a human level, to find out what might be going on in their personal lives that could affect the way they play on a Saturday. He speaks honestly, frankly on occasions, but that engenders loyalty.</p><img id="i-c0cf0c20ac7a03d3" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/09/13/1B7C4DDC00000578-6573081-image-a-98_1547039467043.jpg" height="627" width="634" alt="Nigel played under his father for nine years at Nottingham Forest before leaving for Anfield" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is also a story from his first days as a manager that speaks to his thinking on this. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the time Burton were in the Southern League, the seventh tier of the football ladder, and having earned a good living as a player he owned a Mercedes, having received it as part of his signing-on package at City two years earlier. But the then 32-year-old feared it was too flashy given his new environment, so downgraded to a saloon car.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>DEALINGS WITH THE MEDIA</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clough was the first superstar manager. He was grabbing back page headlines for fun before these modern coaching marvels had laced up their first pair of boots. Being namechecked by Muhammad Ali was all part of it. He realised the power of the media for his own profile but also for sending messages to players.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Speak to journalists from that era and they will tell you he would invite them into his office for lengthy chats and, notebooks filled, their editors would be happy for days. </p><img id="i-dc187ffd09ca42d" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/13/8311408-6573081-image-a-100_1547039696373.jpg" height="428" width="634" alt="Clough and his Burton side face a huge challenge against Manchester City on Wednesday" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Interactions with managers now are much more regulated but Nigel has carried on that tradition of speaking as you see and giving time graciously.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He might not produce the occasional poetry of his father, or make statements that scream off the page, but he does provide clear and bold opinions, such as admitting the prospect of facing City is 'frightening'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You could never accuse him of saying something for effect. He is measured in his words, but open to all questions, and has the same twinkle in his eye his father possessed when dropping a jewell of a line into the discussion. </p><div>

Pedro is fast and direct and his powers may be fading but he still offers Sarri something his other strikers don't.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also, Chelsea do not have the speed at full back when others do. Cesar Azpilicueta was ideal for Conte's back three. Marcos Alonso, a terrific wing-back. Neither fit quite so perfectly into Sarri's plans.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the same time, fatigue is setting in, testing Sarri's desire to operate with a small core of first-team players, resisting any major squad rotation, even in the early stages of the Europa League and the Carabao Cup.</p><img id="i-cba46ad78d301198" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8310210-6573023-image-a-79_1547037235605.jpg" height="413" width="634" alt="Marcos Alonso is a world class wing-back yet doesn't dovetail perfectly with Sarri's strategy" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The development stages of a successful foreign coach arriving in the Premier League often follows a similar theme.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They will arrive and demand more running and intensity, then realise all this high-intensity running around in the world's most competitive league and its demanding fixture fixtures is tiring, and then complain about the gruelling schedule and demand more players.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">NO PLAN B</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps most noticeable in the goalless draw against Southampton when Ralph Hasenhuttl came to Stamford Bridge with a plan to bore Chelsea into submission.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sarri's team had 72 per cent of possession and 17 shots but only six on target. The numbers were similar at Spurs in the Carabao Cup. Only Hazard's individuality lifted Chelsea above the ordinary at Watford on Boxing Day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As more teams - especially those unwilling to go toe-to-toe at football - adopted this tactical plan, scoring has become a problem for Chelsea.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sarri said he was satisfied up to the last 20 metres of the pitch against Saints but the last 20 metres is the important bit.</p><img id="i-df412107d6eb8e11" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8310228-6573023-image-a-81_1547037344045.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Chelsea were left frustrated last week by a Southampton team who packed their defence " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chelsea have failed to find the net in three of their last six games and the manager is behaving as if he thinks he does not have the solution inside his squad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Still, he keeps plugging away with his way of playing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Liverpool finished against Manchester City with Virgil van Dijk at centre-forward. When all else fails, go long to the biggest man you have. When you're crowded out, the most obvious alternatives are set-pieces and aerial attack.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Sarri seems so devoted to his system he has shown no hint of a willingness to change.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe a new centre forward would help. Maybe Higuain can provide the technical presence and score enough goals to make a difference. Maybe it would offer Hazard a little more freedom. Maybe it would lift the manager.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sarriball, however, is a collective philosophy. Maybe it will need more than a new centre forward before it is remodelled successfully for the Premier League.</p><img id="i-56c4f9b1334e2d80" src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8310298-6573023-image-a-83_1547037403923.jpg" height="567" width="634" alt="Higuain could be the man to revive Sarriball - the two men worked together when at Napoli" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>

Then came the humbling at the hands of Tottenham in November and the impetus has faded, goals have dried up and the arm of Sarri's fun-o-meter swung back from the image of happy Hazard to the glum face of Morata. Not a lot is wrong. Chelsea are tight at the back and can dominate in midfield, but at the very top not a lot needs to be wrong and losing twice to Spurs inside seven weeks at Wembley is no Chelsea fan's idea of a having a good time and the manager is searching for answers.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Matt Barlow for MailOnline</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-09T14:59:51.000+01:00</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Why Maurizio Sarri and Chelsea are searching for answers</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-09T14:59:51.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Tottenham Hotspur,Chelsea</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8310190-0-image-a-73_1547037176613.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6571073/Chelsea-boss-Maurizio-Sarri-slams-decision-award-Tottenhams-Harry-Kane-penalty.html" title="Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri slams decision to award Tottenham's Harry Kane a penalty... as Mauricio Pochettino admits: 'I don't like VAR'"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6572445/Will-Chelsea-starlet-Callum-Hudson-Odoi-impress-Bayern-Munich.html" title="Bayern Munich are desperate to make Chelsea starlet Callum Hudson-Odoi into the successor to Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery… so will we see another top English talent follow in Jadon Sancho's footsteps and become a hit in Germany?
