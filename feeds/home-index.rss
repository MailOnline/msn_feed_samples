'He's fictional, but you can't have everything.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's the same for English cricket. We know exactly who is coming to save us after the debacle in the Caribbean. He's West Indian, but we're not going to worry about trifles like that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jofra Archer will be eligible to ride to sorry England's rescue from next month, in time to play in the World Cup and the Ashes.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/20/9383936-6666789-image-a-2_1549311690586.jpg" height="537" width="634" alt="Jofra Archer, pictured in action for the Hobart Hurricanes, will soon be eligible for England" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He bowls at 95mph, he can handle a bat confidently enough to be considered an all-rounder in the white-ball game, and he's been with Sussex since 2016. So that's good enough.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ECB used to demand a seven-year residency period for any player entering the United Kingdom after their 18th birthday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It wasn't how much of the world did it, but the stand was at least based in principle. It showed faith in and prioritised those who had come through the English system; it resisted the increasing opportunism that infects other sports. It allowed smaller countries to make the most of their talent, by removing the temptation to simply desert for financial gain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Obviously, it had to go. Last year, the ECB changed the qualification period to three years. It would be a terrible cynic who questioned the timing, with Archer now available and two huge events coming up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Aussies will take back cheats with open arms,' read one headline about the imminent return of Steve Smith, Cameron Bancroft and David Warner, following the ball-tampering episode. No doubt they will, but at least they are their cheats.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As we know, the athletes and sporting bodies from these shores never cheat, they just have a way with regulatory procedures, with exemptions, with passports.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That's why the most furiously organised team in cycling doesn't keep proper medical records, why our runners celebrate American independence day and why when Izzy Atkin became Great Britain's first Olympic medallist on skis, it was desperately played up that she liked Marmite and Ribena and visited her grandmother in Birmingham because the truth was she had barely set foot in this country, apart from on holiday. We're at it, basically. We're sporting colonialists.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/20/9383944-6666789-image-a-3_1549311808049.jpg" height="436" width="634" alt="Barbados-born Archer bowls at 95mph but can also bat well enough to be called an all-rounder" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Atkin and athletes such as hurdling sisters Tiffany Porter and Cindy Ofili were approached when they were uncertain of making the grade in their own country, but others come from regions where an international career with England has greater prospects, financially and professionally.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sir Viv Richards says Archer, a Barbadian, became disenchanted with West Indies cricket when he was injured playing for the Under-19 team and the care provided was inadequate. Archer would have waited patiently to play for England after that, even if it had taken seven years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe he was poorly treated — but West Indies cricket is impoverished compared to the ECB, of course our grass is going to look greener. It was Chris Jordan who persuaded Archer to join Sussex — another Barbadian lost to the game in the Caribbean having been lured to England by a sports scholarship from Dulwich College.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">England's rugby coach Eddie Jones smiled as he reflected on the victory over Ireland. It was the strongest starting XV he had fielded for a while, and they had performed with exceptional discipline and ferocity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It feels like we've got some new players,' he said. 'And they all come from the same part of the world. So we shopped pretty well. It was good shopping. We definitely went to Waitrose, not one of those cheap ones.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Actually, the RFU didn't do the shopping. The Vunipola boys, Mako and Billy, of Tongan heritage, came to Britain when their father Fe'ao got a contract to play for Pontypool, and later Pontypridd. They were raised and educated here, not picked off the shelves as fully fledged rugby players.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nor was Manu Tuilagi. His older brothers were all rugby players and he arrived at 13 from Samoa, to live with them in the hope he could be, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Only Nathan Hughes came to England as an adult professional, with Wasps, at the age of 21. He is Fijian but qualifies by residency.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, no, the RFU didn't exactly do a supermarket sweep to make Jones's England team, but we know what he means.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/22/9386962-6666789-England_rugby_union_star_Manu_Tuilagi_moved_to_the_United_Kingdo-a-6_1549319501536.jpg" height="409" width="634" alt="England rugby union star Manu Tuilagi moved to the United Kingdom when he was a teenager" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is an obvious attraction in taking on another nationality, given the limitations of the Pacific Islands economy and every major rugby-playing nation knows it. Ambitious fee-paying schools in the southern hemisphere plunder the islands with offers of scholarships and, increasingly, northern hemisphere schools do, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the plus side, it affords social mobility, albeit only for the athletically gifted, on the minus, it strips the Pacific Islands of their talent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2013, when Fiji's Under-18 secondary school team beat the All Black equivalent 22-20, all but one of them left to play abroad immediately. Pacific island coaches do not see success in that competition as victory — the aim is to win scholarships and contracts, even though it means losing the youth to a rival.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Young players are prostituting themselves, rather than playing for their own countries,' said Richards of modern cricket and major institutions are complicit. It is why Jones spoke of shopping.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Australia's squad to face Fiji in 2017 contained a majority of Pacific Islands descent. The argument is everyone does it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fine, if we are happy reducing sport to its coldest, most pragmatic rationale, fine if, in a country relatively awash with money, we continue plucking jewels like Archer from former colonies. England could certainly do with him right now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As long as we don't kid ourselves that a bequest from history is England's victory. It hardly feels like one.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/22/9387516-6666789-Viv_Richards_said_Players_are_prostituting_themselves_rather_tha-a-7_1549319501549.jpg" height="391" width="634" alt="Viv  Richards said: 'Players are prostituting themselves rather than playing for their countries'" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sorry Sarri, you're dreaming</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maurizio Sarri was purring after Chelsea's 5-0 win over Huddersfield. He spoke of the team playing 'his' football again. This is going to grow old very quickly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leaving aside that Huddersfield may well end up with numbers to rival Sunderland in 2002-03 or Derby in 2007-08, it can't be Sarri-ball when Chelsea win, and everyone else's ball when they do not.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Managers take ownership of performances, good and bad, and if they refuse, players see through that very quickly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sarri styles himself as a dreamer, who just wants beautiful football, his way. But didn't he have that at Napoli? Wasn't the team set up to his specification and playing what Pep Guardiola described as the finest football in Europe? So why leave? Sarri might be a dreamer, but his financial adviser sounds more of a realist. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/22/9387644-6666789-Chelsea_boss_Maurizio_Sarri_was_very_pleased_with_how_his_team_p-a-8_1549319501553.jpg" height="414" width="634" alt="Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri was very pleased with how his team played against Huddersfield" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Common sense not rule change for handballs</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is three and counting this season: three goals in which handball has played a crucial part, yet been deemed accidental, if spotted at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In two of these — Willy Boly for Wolves against Manchester City, and Sergio Aguero for Manchester City against Arsenal on Sunday — the handball was the vital last touch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the other incident, Alexandre Lacazette for Arsenal against Crystal Palace, it served as the assist for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Next month, the International Football Association Board will consider a number of rule changes at their annual meeting. The removal of the word 'deliberately' with regard to handball offences is one of them.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/22/9387744-6666789-Striker_Sergio_Aguero_scored_with_his_hand_as_Manchester_City_be-a-9_1549319501605.jpg" height="439" width="634" alt="Striker Sergio Aguero scored with his hand as Manchester City beat Arsenal 3-1 on Sunday" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would certainly end goals like Boly or Aguero's, where the ball is put in with the hand, but clearly without intent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet there does have to be further clarification if we are not to merely reshuffle the miscarriages of justice. Football cannot become like hockey, where inferior players can win the cheapest of free-hits, simply by striking the ball unavoidably against the foot of an opponent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A smart technical footballer could earn 20 penalties a season by targeting the arm of a covering defender.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wouldn't clarification serve better than rule change — that goals cannot be scored with the hand, even unintentionally. Isn't that just common sense?</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>City's new era of glory has spawned the Cockney Blue</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Where the media sit at the Etihad Stadium is near the Tunnel Club, the exclusive executive area that is part of Manchester City's conversion to a global enterprise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It offers pitch-side access, a view of the players' tunnel, the most upmarket dining, the comfiest seats. We should run a sweep on the time of the last Tunneller back for the second half: Sunday's winner, resplendent in a City scarf so new you could smell the wool, clocked in just after 63 minutes. At the end, she clapped and cheered as if it mattered. Still, that's football, 2019.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Across the row to me were two kids, not little, but not teenagers either. They were wearing the same coats, so were probably brothers. There was a man with them, probably dad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Arsenal scored, the older one punched the air, but discreetly. He had obviously been told not to show out. I sensed dad was quite happy, too. The boy, I noticed, had the Arsenal crest on his gloves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His younger brother, meanwhile, looked bereft. He kept that same anguished expression for 30 minutes or so then, when City scored, he went nuts. Stuck it to his older brother. Really gloating, right in his face. To be fair, he took it well.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/22/9387840-6666789-City_are_becoming_more_and_more_popular_outside_of_Manchester_es-a-10_1549319501606.jpg" height="392" width="634" alt="City are becoming more and more popular outside of Manchester, especially with young fans" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then the younger brother pushed it too far. Then he got a slap. It was off again when the third went in. More taunting, more fighting. They ended up either side of dad, and later in separate rows. The Arsenal lad certainly put up a better second-half show than his team.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So here's my theory. The dad's Arsenal, the older brother is Arsenal, but the younger one is City. He's grown up in an era when they are the best team, with the best players. He wants some of that. He's a Cockney Blue, the first of a new breed. City fans come from Manchester, traditionally; United fans, well they can come from anywhere. But it will change.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As City become a global concern, a corporate machine, they will draw a generation of fans from unimagined locales, just like Chelsea.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Roman Abramovich arrived, we were told they could never be a big club. Not anymore. Look at Chelsea's numbers abroad, look at their reach — success creates that fan base. It will happen to City, too. Cockney Blues. Not sure the regulars are ready for it, but it's coming. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/22/9387866-6666789-Success_brings_popularity_and_City_will_soon_establish_themselve-a-11_1549319501607.jpg" height="443" width="634" alt="Success brings popularity and City will soon establish themselves as a global powerhouse" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Fans deserve warning if clubs aren't up for the cup </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The worst of it is probably over, with the last 16 now looming, but here's one final thought on the fielding of weakened teams in the FA Cup.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 1997, when Roy Keane suffered a season-ending ligament injury for Manchester United in a match against Leeds, the club had a dilemma. United were playing Juventus in an important Champions League match and Sir Alex Ferguson didn't want the atmosphere at Old Trafford falling flat on hearing their captain would be missing until the following year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">United, however, were a listed company and were advised they were duty bound to inform the Stock Exchange of Keane's position, because a long-term injury to such a senior player could affect their chances of success, which in turn would influence the share price. United announced Keane was out for the season the morning after the Juventus game.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet if companies have to be fair to shareholders, why don't clubs have to respect fans? Without giving the team away, if a club in the cup is likely to make six or more changes from its last league fixture, should it not have to announce this when tickets go on sale so that supporters know what they are getting?</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/22/9388002-6666789-Midfielder_Roy_Keane_pictured_playing_for_Manchester_United_in_t-a-12_1549319501620.jpg" height="528" width="634" alt="Midfielder Roy Keane pictured playing for Manchester United in the Premier League in 1997" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">A manager will talk vaguely of changes, then strip the heart from the team. Sometimes it works — Watford swapped their entire XI at Newcastle, and still won. Yet had they lost, those who had made the long journey north would rightly have felt short-changed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The counter-argument is that fans support a club, not a specific XI, and whoever pulls on the shirt is their team for the day — but that idea stretches loyalty too far.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Technically, a club could play its academy in the FA Cup and fans would have to get behind the decision. No — while clubs charge, and transport costs, there is a contract of sorts, and a right to know. If fans had to be told whether major changes were likely, and the club held accountable for this information, they couldn't feel ripped off.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/22/9387998-6666789-Marco_Silva_needs_a_win_but_beating_Liverpool_s_title_rivals_Cit-a-13_1549319501621.jpg" height="457" width="634" alt="Marco Silva needs a win but beating Liverpool's title rivals City could upset some Everton fans" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Evertonians, manager Marco Silva is one defeat from the sack.

For evidence, you only had to watch Sky's golf coverage from the Saudi International at the weekend.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/10/9365776-6665045-image-a-7_1549276676786.jpg" height="382" width="634" alt="Sergio Garcia played out of a bunker during the second round of the Saudi International" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">To be fair, their roster of commentators were on form. Nick Dougherty has slotted seamlessly into the presenter's role, Richard Boxall was solid as ever and Wayne Riley and Andrew Coltart provided colour from the course. Yet how the coverage cried out for Miller's brand of truth when it came to the shameful actions of Sergio Garcia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was watching on Saturday afternoon when Tim Barter read out a short European Tour statement regarding Garcia's disqualification for 'serious misconduct.' My bottom jaw went slack. I'm sure I wasn't alone in crying out: 'What on earth could he have done to the greens to justify that?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No explanation from Sky. The only reference was a clearly uncomfortable Coltart informing us Garcia would be disappointed with his behaviour and that the Spaniard had apologised.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there was the 20-minute wrap-up after the tournament had finished the following day when the full scale of Garcia's vandalism was known.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/10/9365778-6665045-image-a-6_1549276672971.jpg" height="382" width="634" alt="After playing his shot an irate Garcia then hacked at the sand several times in fury" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/10/9365782-6665045-image-a-8_1549276688572.jpg" height="382" width="634" alt="He aggressively raked the sand too, fuming at the lie he had found his ball in" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fair enough, they talked about the winner, and the players who finished second, third and fourth, but how on earth do you not also discuss the all-time record Ryder Cup points scorer defacing greens and becoming the first player to be disqualified for such behaviour since the tour was founded in 1972? Are they seriously suggesting it wasn't still a talking point?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That was Miller time. He wouldn't have given two hoots for Garcia's reputation. This is the man who once said of Phil Mickelson: 'If he couldn't chip, he'd be selling cars in San Diego.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In America, Sir Nick Faldo has carried on the straight-shooting Miller tradition, as has Brandel Chamblee on the Golf Channel, although he is too in love with the sound of his own voice for my taste. Miller kept his thoughts succinct and never hogged the mic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now 71, the former Open and US Open Champion signed off at the Waste Management Open in Phoenix with a rueful grin, telling viewers: 'Thanks for accepting my form of commentating.

When he packed up as a player in 1990, Johnny Miller's flair-filled style and two major championship victories meant he was already destined to enter the annals as one of the greats. He was even better as a broadcaster for NBC and, boy, are we going to miss his fearlessness.

In the end, it wasn’t the sink, more of a hand basin. The insipid grey change strip rather summed up Liverpool’s performance. West Ham didn’t get a shot on target after half-time but, even then, probably had the best chance of the late exchanges when Mark Noble shot over from close range on 73 minutes. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong></p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/20/9387546-6666919-image-a-25_1549312771079.jpg" height="624" width="962" alt="West Ham stunned Liverpool with a quick free-kick that caught out the Reds defence and slipped in Michail Antonio" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/20/9387534-6666919-image-a-27_1549312780382.jpg" height="715" width="962" alt="Antonio made no mistake with the finish as he was not followed by Andy Robertson when he ran into the penalty area" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/20/9387554-6666919-image-a-29_1549312784136.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="The Hammers made an excellent response from going a goal down to equalising within six minutes at the London Stadium" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/21/9388350-6666919-image-a-36_1549314021387.jpg" height="612" width="962" alt="Liverpool were under pressure to extend their lead over Manchester City at the top of the table to five points" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox sport" data-version="2" id="mol-2a3cf3a0-28b5-11e9-abee-0bc70d950c85">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">MATCH FACTS, LIVE LEAGUE TABLE AND MATCH ZONE </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <div class="cleared row mol-cols mol-cols-3" id="mol-334b3830-28b5-11e9-abee-0bc70d950c85">                            <div class="mol-col span4 mol-col-1" style="style">                                <div class="cleared mol-col-content"><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WEST HAM (4-2-3-1): </strong>Fabianski 7; Fredericks 7, Ogbonna 7.5, Diop 8, Cresswell 7; Noble 7, Rice 7; Antonio 7, Anderson 7.5, Snodgrass 6; Chicharito 7</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Subs: </strong>Adrian, Zabaleta, Carroll, Obiang, Masuaku, Perez, Diangana</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Goal</strong>: Antonio 28</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Manager </strong>– Manuel Pellegrini 7</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>LIVERPOOL (4-3-3):</strong> Alisson 6; Milner 6, Matip 6, Van Dijk 6.5, Robertson 7; Fabinho 7, Keita 6, Lallana 7; Salah 6.5, Firmino 6, Mane 7</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Subs</strong>: Mignolet, Sturridge, Moreno, Shaqiri, Origi, Jones, Camacho</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Goal</strong>: Mane 22 </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Manager </strong>– Jurgen Klopp 6</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Attendance </strong>– 59,903</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Referee </strong>– K Friend 7</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Man-of-the-Match </strong>– Issa Diop</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Ratings by Dominic King at the London Stadium</span></p>                                </div>                            </div><div class="mol-col span4 mol-col-2" style="style">                                <div class="cleared mol-col-content">                                    <p class="mol-para-with-font"><br /></p>                                </div>                            </div><div class="mol-col span4 mol-col-3" style="style"> <div class="cleared mol-col-content"> <img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/21/9389870-6666919-image-a-55_1549316003935.jpg" height="362" width="296" alt="Sadio Mane gave the Reds the lead after good work from Adam Lallana slipped an offside James Milner in on goal.

If Manchester City win at Everton tomorrow night they will go top on goal difference, albeit having played a game more. Nonetheless, there is the potential for momentum shift. A week ago, after City lost at Newcastle, some thought they had blown it. Now their challenge seems more alive than ever as the strain of being front-runners — and a lengthy list of injuries in defensive positions — take a toll on Liverpool.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were moments in the second half when Mo Salah looked capable of sparking something, including one fabulous piece of trickery that removed two West Ham players from the game. But this was one of his quieter evenings. The same for Roberto Firmino, who was withdrawn early.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/20/9387600-6666919-image-a-31_1549312790813.jpg" height="610" width="962" alt="Sadio Mane gave the Reds the lead after good work from Adam Lallana slipped an offside James Milner in on goal" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/20/9387586-6666919-image-a-33_1549312794716.jpg" height="693" width="962" alt="The goal stood despite Milner being offside and Mane slid on his knees to celebrate his 11th Premier League goal of the season" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">West Ham, meanwhile were without Marko Arnautovic, but still created the majority of chances. And this is how it is going to be, from here. Liverpool and Manchester City trading blows, gaining and losing advantage, needing to match their results each week, from now until May. There are no jokers to play either — no six-point head-to-head meetings. They have all gone. Tottenham are in it, too, so this is a proper scrap, a better title race than we have witnessed since the days when Brendan Rodgers was Liverpool manager, and ended up ceding the spoils to Manchester City at the last.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Liverpool benefited hugely from by far the biggest officiating error of the night. There have often been complaints about the sight lines at the London Stadium but how they prevented linesman Simon Beck spotting an offside in the build-up to Liverpool’s goal that happened almost within touching distance is a mystery. That flagging for it would have cancelled out a wonderful piece of skill from Adam Lallana is irrelevant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Credit Lallana, though, and James Milner too. It was Milner’s 81st assist of his Premier League career, putting him in the top seven goal providers, and overtaking David Beckham’s 80.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At first it looked as if Lallana had merely battled his way through two West Ham defenders. Closer inspection, however, revealed quite lovely footwork, shifting the ball one way then another before lifting it artfully to Milner on the overlap. He was offside, though, and by some distance, too. And Beck was right there, almost a participant. No flag, though, and Milner capitalised by whipping in a cross to Sadio Mane. And while West Ham can feel aggrieved about that build-up, that is no excuse for the room the scorer was allowed. Mane had space to turn and fire a low shot past Fabianski. It had taken a little time but it seemed as if at last Liverpool were away. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/21/9389378-6666919-image-a-49_1549315209722.jpg" height="647" width="962" alt="Declan Rice should have given the Hammers the lead just before half time but his header flew over the cross bar" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/21/9388406-6666919-image-a-38_1549314157118.jpg" height="690" width="962" alt="Javier Hernandez came close to giving West Ham the lead with a curling effort that went a whisker past the post" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/21/9389602-6666919-image-a-54_1549315553775.jpg" height="529" width="962" alt="Mane came close to adding his second of the game before the break from a corner but his effort was dealt with by Fabianski" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/21/9388520-6666919-image-a-40_1549314292469.jpg" height="653" width="962" alt="Adam Lallana was starting his first league match since October for the Reds and he hit a tame effort outside the box" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">As has been the case at the top of late, though, it didn’t quite unfold as planned. Within six minutes, West Ham restored deserved parity through a brilliantly worked free-kick. Aaron Cresswell rolled the ball to Felipe Anderson, who stopped it and slipped a pass through to Michail Antonio, urgently in front of Naby Keita. His low shot went across Alisson with such precision the goalkeeper was caught flat-footed. He didn’t even move.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It wasn’t the only time West Ham’s set-pieces troubled Liverpool. By the end of the half they could easily have taken advantage on two further occasions. The set-up was always the same — short, rolled to Anderson — but the delivery seemed to take Klopp’s men by surprise. Next time out, the ball was struck deep to Javier Hernandez who sent a volleyed shot into orbit, where it was met by another volley, from Noble, landing on the roof of the net.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then, with four minutes to go before half-time, West Ham spurned the chance of the game. The same free-kick routine this time found Declan Rice streaking ahead of Liverpool’s defence, unmarked. It was him versus Alisson, and a free header. He missed the target. He’s a brilliant young talent and the star of West Ham’s season so, after the initial shock, he drew a sympathetic round of applause and encouragement. But what a chance it was. What a chance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And there were a few other moments. The game was only three minutes old when Noble picked out Hernandez, who cut inside but screwed his low shot wide of the far post. Just seven minutes later, Cresswell took a chance from 25 yards and missed narrowly — and from similar range in the 16th minute Hernandez forced an excellent save from Alisson. Liverpool were strangely subdued. There was little sign of recent supremacy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even so, they remain three points clear. Everton is never an easy place to go, even with the team in poor form, so nothing is guaranteed for City. Yet last Wednesday morning, Liverpool needed to defeat Leicester at Anfield to move seven points clear, and now, when they return there to play Bournemouth on Saturday, they could be in second place. Maybe having the pressure off will suit them. It’s the one silver lining right now.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/21/9388678-6666919-image-a-43_1549314444153.jpg" height="680" width="962" alt="Roberto Firmino was struggling to get involved in the game in the first half as he tried to break down the West Ham defence" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/21/9389312-6666919-image-a-44_1549315052059.jpg" height="687" width="962" alt="It was a scrappy affair in midfield as the two sides tried to control the game - Fabinho and Robert Snodgrass often tussled" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/21/9389354-6666919-image-a-46_1549315167003.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Hernandez, who used to play for Liverpool's arch enemies Manchester United, was lively on Monday night" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/21/9389586-6666919-image-a-50_1549315513310.jpg" height="624" width="962" alt="Mark Noble attempted a shot on goal under pressure from goalscorer Mane but his effort did not trouble Alisson in goal" /><video preload="none" id="1856410" title="Liverpool Jurgen Klopp speaks after his side draws with West Ham" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/04/23/video-9393456-362_636x358.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/02/04/7698136765479828570/1024x576_MP4_7698136765479828570.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>MARTIN SAMUEL AT THE LONDON STADIUM: This is what pressure does.

This is not the Liverpool we know, the team of the season so far. </dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Martin Samuel for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-02-05T11:33:56.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>West Ham 1-1 Liverpool: Michail Antonio trips up Reds in title race</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-02-05T11:33:56.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Jurgen Klopp,Liverpool,Premier League,West Ham United</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/05/11/9414194-0-image-a-3_1549366364537.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6665659/West-Ham-vs-Liverpool-LIVE-score-lineups-updates-Premier-League.html" title="West Ham 0-0 Liverpool, LIVE - Jurgen Klopp's men aim to move five points clear of title rivals Manchester City in London Stadium Premier League clash"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6666959/Liverpool-dealt-double-blow-Jordan-Henderson-Georginio-Wijnaldum-ruled-West-Ham-clash.html" title="Liverpool dealt double blow as Jordan Henderson and Georginio Wijnaldum ruled out of West Ham clash "></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6666649/West-Ham-make-hilarious-gaffe-mistakenly-welcome-Gunners-programme.html" title="Ready for Arsenal?

Jones won't hear of that, with a Grand Slam to play for first, but results like this, and the timing of them, is important.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In summer 2003, before travelling to the southern hemisphere for the World Cup in the autumn, Sir Clive Woodward took England on a mini-tour, playing New Zealand in Wellington and Australia in Melbourne.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They won both matches — only the second time an England team had won in New Zealand, and the first ever Test win in Australia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That blew away any doubts that they could beat Australia on home turf — which is exactly what they had to do in the final. Jones would remember that, being Australia's coach at the time, and reminded of it even he had to concede that, in a World Cup year, some results have significance beyond their immediate sphere.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/21/9345722-6663629-image-a-97_1549230338248.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Eddie Jones was delighted at the win but feels there is a long way to go until the World Cup" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'What a result like this does is give you the confidence to work harder,' said Jones. 'So in that way, yes, it's very positive. But having been involved in three World Cups, the only period when it is important to have the team at its best is just before the competition.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We're a long way from that, and it is really hard to sustain absolutely outstanding performances for that time, because the game is so exacting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Look at what Mako Vunipola did — he's 125kg, that's big enough to be a sumo wrestler, and he's making 27 tackles, he's making 11 carries, he's scrumming, he's lifting in the lineout. The intensity of the game is such that you've actually got to work out when you want to peak and when you need to take it off a bit.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To that end, Jones claims he is only now beginning to work on England's attack having got the rest of their play — defence and set-pieces — stable. Fine tuning will involve better game management, maintaining concentration when modern rugby contains so much hanging around. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jones compared it to professional golfers needing to stay focused for five hours when the tiniest fraction of that time involves hitting the ball.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was one aspect of the Dublin display that particularly pleased Jones; that his team arrived with a plan and adhered to it until the last. 'We could have got seduced with the way the game was going and we didn't,' he added.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/21/9345572-6663629-image-m-95_1549230191566.jpg" height="457" width="634" alt="An apt comparison to England's rugby would be the gegenpressing of Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jones likes his football people and his football analogies, so one hopes he would take it as a compliment that to explain England's tactics to a rugby layman, the most apt comparison would be the gegenpressing style of Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The defensive line speed was sensational, the way Liverpool can be in those periods when they swarm around opponents, when it appears they have an extra two in midfield. England were like that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Lawes got on in the second half for George Kruis and immediately hit Jonny Sexton with a runaway train of a tackle, it was clear there would be no let up. England were relentless, as Ireland have so often been.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At one time referee Jerome Garces took Kyle Sinckler to task for some relentless jabber. 'I'm sorry, sir,' he replied, 'I'm just really excited.' And that was still the first half. Imagine him at the end.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/21/9345768-6663629-image-a-96_1549230292175.jpg" height="431" width="634" alt="Kyle Sinckler admitted to the referee that he was 'really excited' during England's victory" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe a spell in the wilderness under Jones has made England stronger and more rounded. Having experienced the highs — a Grand Slam in his first year, a whitewash sequence of tour wins in Australia — they have had to deal with the low of a fifth place finish in the Six Nations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe the fall was necessary for them to emerge, cleansed, on the other side. Perhaps it helped to be the underdogs on Saturday. After so many accusations of arrogance, to arrive in Dublin as write-offs, with Ireland's sponsors Volkswagen offering 'trade-ins on broken chariots' might have been a release.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Last year was great for learning,' said Billy Vunipola. 'It was tough to take but, personally, it helped. Maybe it made us as a team, having those scars. All the boys were on fire today. I probably had the best seat in the stadium to watch the whole team. It wasn't just my brother who was awesome.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Ireland are very physical, but they're also very smart and we were ready for the challenge. But once it's done it's done. We need to remain grounded. It's just another performance. It can be replicated, it can be improved. I don't want this to be the benchmark because that implies we can't get better and I think we can.'</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/22/9346718-6663629-image-m-103_1549231967312.jpg" height="450" width="634" alt="Billy Vunipola believes losing to Ireland in last year's Six Nations was a great learning curve" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brother Mako added: 'When you beat Ireland on their own patch it's a statement result. But we're under no illusion that we played the perfect game.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The real test is to maintain this. We talked about it immediately after the game. It's no good just doing it one week. We take this into next week, but first we take it into training.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The eyebrow was doing a quickstep by this time. Try to contain it, if England do take a serious tilt at a Slam in World Cup year.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>MARTIN SAMUEL AT THE AVIVA STADIUM: Not since the passing of Sir Roger Moore has a left eyebrow done as much work as that of Mako Vunipola.

Still, that is not what will be concerning football's historians in the years to come. This was the 14th hat-trick of Sergio Aguero's Manchester City career, and his tenth in the Premier League – bringing him one short of Alan Shearer's modern era record of 11.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How impressive is that? Well, consider the context. As of Monday morning Aguero has scored as many league hat-tricks as Cristiano Ronaldo, Didier Drogba, Mo Salah, Eden Hazard, Dennis Bergkamp and Eric Cantona – combined. Take Drogba out and put Steven Gerrard in, and he's got more. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is a phenomenal, match-winning, title-winning goalscorer, one of the greatest English football has seen. Will he win the title again this year? If not, it won't be for want of trying. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9341062-6662993-Sergio_Aguero_slid_in_at_the_crucial_moment_in_the_second_half_t-a-1_1549219323381.jpg" height="514" width="962" alt="Sergio Aguero slid in at the crucial moment in the second half to bundle the ball over for 3-1, though it did touch his arm" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9340322-6662993-The_striker_watched_on_as_the_ball_flicked_off_his_elbow_and_mad-a-2_1549219323382.jpg" height="659" width="962" alt="The striker watched on as the ball flicked off his elbow and made its way into the bottom corner for his and City's third goal" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9341066-6662993-image-a-3_1549219323382.jpg" height="617" width="962" alt="Arsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno tried desperately to claw the ball back, but it had already gone well over the goal-line" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9340324-6662993-Arsenal_players_immediately_protested_for_handball_as_Aguero_rac-a-4_1549219323382.jpg" height="658" width="962" alt="Arsenal players immediately protested for handball as Aguero raced away in celebration and the Etihad began to cheer" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9340320-6662993-The_prolific_forward_soaked_up_the_adoration_of_the_home_crown_a-a-5_1549219323383.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="The prolific forward soaked up the adoration of the home crown after completing his hat-trick in the crucial league fixture" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9340328-6662993-The_Gunners_surrounding_referee_Martin_Atkinson_but_their_protes-a-6_1549219323504.jpg" height="680" width="962" alt="The Gunners surrounding referee Martin Atkinson -

All three were from close range, the result of an innate understanding of where the ball would arrive. That sort of talent is instinctive. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I turned up and the ball turned up,' Jimmy Greaves once recalled. 'I didn't know what made me go there.' That is what happened to Aguero. He turned up and the ball turned up: three times, the sum total of his scoring attempts. Each time he found a way to get it across the line – by fair means or foul. If that makes him sound duplicitous, rest assured the foul play was unintended. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aguero was trying to complete his hat-trick legitimately when fortune intervened. What should have been deemed handball went unnoticed, and Aguero took the game beyond Arsenal's reach. To be fair, he also had what looked a justified penalty appeal denied, and City would probably have won anyway. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Arsenal did not have a shot on target in the second-half, despite trailing 2-1. It was their most toothless 45 minutes since a first half against Manchester United in May 2015. Make no mistake, City were very much worth the three points.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was a sign of their comfort that when, after 66 minutes, Arsenal coach Unai Emery decided to introduce new loan signing Denis Suarez, late of Barcelona, Pep Guardiola took four steps sideways to pat his countryman on the back and wish him well. A manager doesn't do that if he feels greatly worried about what is going to happen next. City were where they had hoped to be by then – two points off Liverpool, who have a game in hand at West Ham tonight. Just imagine. Had they won at Newcastle, City would be leading the league by now. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9339630-6662993-Sergio_Aguero_answered_City_s_call_on_the_cusp_of_half_time_and_-a-8_1549219323506.jpg" height="546" width="962" alt="Aguero answered Man City's call on the cusp of half-time and popped up at the back post to slot home and restore the lead" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9339624-6662993-The_Argentine_remained_focused_to_latch_onto_Raheem_Sterling_s_s-a-9_1549219323506.jpg" height="577" width="962" alt="The Argentine remained focused to latch onto Raheem Sterling's squared ball across to score his and City's second goal" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9340584-6662993-New_boy_Denis_Suarez_entered_the_action_late_in_the_second_half_-a-10_1549219323507.jpg" height="617" width="962" alt="New boy Denis Suarez entered the action late in the second half to make his first appearance in an Arsenal shirt" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9340124-6662993-Unai_Emery_remained_animated_on_the_touchline_and_continually_at-a-11_1549219323507.jpg" height="633" width="962" alt="Unai Emery remained animated on the touchline and continually attempted to conduct his men into action at the Etihad" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9340586-6662993-German_defender_Shkodran_Mustafi_required_some_treatment_after_g-a-12_1549219323598.jpg" height="551" width="962" alt="German defender Shkodran Mustafi required some treatment after going down painfully during the physical encounter" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">And for a while, there must have been a fear of history repeating. As at Newcastle, City took the lead inside the first minute and, for a spell, failed to capitalise on it. Maybe it's because their standards are so impossibly high, but it really is quite mystifying that Guardiola's players can hit such a giddying height and then, just as suddenly, go to sleep. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">City could have been three up inside five minutes, but were level after ten, and only restored their advantage just before half-time. Maybe it is simply impossible to maintain such a high level of technical excellence, just as Liverpool cannot always sustain the exhausting intensity of gegenpressing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is hard to uphold City's explosion from the traps for 90 minutes, either. Of all the goals scored in the first minute since the inception of the Premier League, 1.4 per cent of them have been the work of Aguero in the last six days. A 50-second opener here to go with the 24-second goal he scored in Newcastle on Tuesday, the two fastest goals of the season so far; City certainly know how to hit the ground running, even if they are not always capable of continuing at such a ferocious pace.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, as at Newcastle, Aguero got City off to a flyer and what followed was something of a puzzle. City are becoming quite the enigma. Periods of drift, punctuated by explosions of white hot genius. Aguero's first was a lightning strike, his second was forged by one of the finest passages of play of the season; but Guardiola looked quite perturbed by the bit in between. He knows he has the players to be substantially better than Arsenal; as that second half proved. </p><video preload="none" id="1855476" title="Guardiola says title race is still open after 3-1 win v Arsenal" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/21/video-9345726-555_636x358.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/02/03/5628682771678908164/1024x576_MP4_5628682771678908164.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9339060-6662993-Laurent_Koscileny_planted_his_head_on_the_ball_and_sent_it_past_-a-13_1549219323598.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Laurent Koscielny planted his head on the ball and sent it past Ederson to equalise before the goalkeeper even had a chance" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9340122-6662993-image-a-14_1549219323599.jpg" height="690" width="962" alt="The Frenchman stooped low to connect his header and fire the ball past a helpless Ederson at close quarters in the first half" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9340284-6662993-The_Brazilian_flung_his_arms_up_in_vain_but_the_ball_had_already-a-15_1549219323599.jpg" height="747" width="962" alt="The Brazilian flung his arms up in vain, but the ball had already rocketed past him and bulged in the back of the netting" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9338972-6662993-The_Gunners_skipper_wheeled_away_with_arms_outstretched_after_ca-a-16_1549219323600.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="The Gunners skipper wheeled away with arms outstretched after cancelling out City's early goal and pulling his side level" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9339254-6662993-Nacho_Monreal_had_initially_jumped_highest_to_meet_the_corner_ba-a-17_1549219323600.jpg" height="640" width="962" alt="Nacho Monreal had initially jumped highest to meet the corner ball and make a flicked assist for Koscielny to head it home" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9338974-6662993-Pep_Guardiola_looked_concerned_on_the_touchline_as_his_side_surr-a-18_1549219323601.jpg" height="750" width="962" alt="Pep Guardiola looked concerned on the touchline as his side surrendered their early lead at the Etihad on Sunday evening" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anyway, start at the beginning – and what a beginning it was.

He crossed and Aguero finished with a diving header – an all-too-rare means of conversion in the modern game. Within five minutes, City could have had two more.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They were short-changed by referee Martin Atkinson when Shkodran Mustafi undoubtedly tugged at Aguero as he attempted to get in behind to receive a pass from Kevin De Bruyne. It should have been a penalty, but Atkinson waved it away. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A superb save from Bernd Leno kept out a 30-yard effort from Raheem Sterling out with merely five minutes gone but in that short time City looked capable of anything. And then, somehow, Arsenal ended up back in the game.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kyle Walker conceded a corner, much against the run of play, which was whipped in by Lucas Torreira, as City's marking twice let them down. Nacho Monreal won the first header, at the near post, Laurent Koscielny converted it, stooping, inside the six-yard box. Half of the goals City have let in this season have been from set pieces – the poorest ratio of any team in the Premier League. </p><video preload="none" id="1855478" title="Unai Emery says Arsenal will improve after losing 3-1 to Man City" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/21/video-9345786-345_636x358.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/02/03/9158177274583235578/1024x576_MP4_9158177274583235578.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9338998-6662993-Defender_Aymeric_Laporte_thought_he_had_made_it_2_0_to_City_earl-a-19_1549219323601.jpg" height="590" width="962" alt="Defender Aymeric Laporte thought he had made it 2-0 to City early on, but his headed goal was ruled offside from a free-kick" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9339450-6662993-Monreal_took_a_tumble_as_Unai_Emery_rushed_to_the_touchline_to_b-a-20_1549219323602.jpg" height="700" width="962" alt="Monreal took a tumble as Unai Emery rushed to the touchline to bark commands at his Arsenal players" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9339076-6662993-Sergo_Aguero_launched_himself_at_full_stretch_to_get_his_head_on-a-21_1549219323602.jpg" height="531" width="962" alt="Aguero launched himself at full stretch to get his head onto the ball and break the deadlock after just a minute of play" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9339078-6662993-Aguero_beat_Monreal_to_the_ball_and_used_his_striker_s_instinct_-a-22_1549219323603.jpg" height="546" width="962" alt="Aguero beat Monreal to the ball and used his striker's instinct to finish clinically and take first blood for champions City" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9338712-6662993-The_Argentine_hit_the_turf_after_making_connection_and_kept_his_-a-23_1549219323610.jpg" height="586" width="962" alt="The Argentine hit the turf after making connection and kept his eyes on the ball as it made its way towards the far corner" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9338724-6662993-Goalkeeper_Bernd_Leno_could_only_look_back_and_watch_as_the_ball-a-24_1549219323611.jpg" height="603" width="962" alt="Goalkeeper Leno could only look back and watch as the ball careered past him and nestled into the far corner of the net" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9338714-6662993-Aguero_peeled_away_in_celebration_after_putting_City_into_the_le-a-25_1549219323611.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Aguero peeled away in celebration after putting City into the lead and adding to his goal haul for the season" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/18/9338716-6662993-The_big_screens_at_the_Etihad_beamed_the_image_of_the_Argentine_-a-26_1549219323612.jpg" height="1314" width="962" alt="The big screens at the Etihad beamed the image of the Argentine hitman as the home supporters made lots of noise" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just as well they are occasionally touched by angels, then. Having offered little bar the odd pot shot after, City burst into life and back into the lead on 43 minutes, with a goal of exquisite beauty and clinical execution. Fernandinho played a crossfield pass to Sterling on the left, the England man cutting it back on the diagonal for Bernardo Silva. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What followed constituted a one-two, but of a type few teams can conceive, let alone play. Silva returned the ball to Sterling, now slightly inside, with the deftest chip taking Arsenal's back line by surprise and enabling him to pick out Aguero once again, at the far post. It lacked the show favoured by the highlights reels, but was no less of a goal for that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The same combination brought City's third, after 61 minutes. Sterling cut the ball back, Bernd Leno pushed it – he should have gathered it, have no doubt, and the top strata of goalkeepers certainly would – and Aguero bundled it over the line. It touched the top of one leg, his flank, maybe his chest, and most crucially an elbow, but Atkinson let it stand. It was an accident, but it was most definitely handball. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Next year, if rule changes are passed and with VAR introduced, it almost certainly wouldn't stand. This year, it cooked Arsenal's goose, and placed a little more weight on Liverpool's shoulders. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With City due to visit Everton on Wednesday, if Liverpool fail to win at the London Stadium on Monday night, they could be in second place by the middle of the week. Aguerooo, indeed.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>MARTIN SAMUEL AT THE ETIHAD STADIUM: It was sort of the perfect hat-trick: a header, one with the right foot, one with the left, er, elbow. Still, that is not what will be concerning football's historians in the years to come. This was the 14th hat-trick of Sergio Aguero's Manchester City career, and his tenth in the Premier League – bringing him one short of Alan Shearer's modern era record of 11. How impressive is that? Well, consider the context. As of Monday morning Aguero has scored as many league hat-tricks as Cristiano Ronaldo, Didier Drogba, Mo Salah, Eden Hazard, Dennis Bergkamp and Eric Cantona – combined. Take Drogba out and put Steven Gerrard in, and he's got more.  This is a phenomenal, match-winning, title-winning goalscorer, one of the greatest English football has seen. Will he win the title again this year? If not, it won't be for want of trying.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Martin Samuel for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-02-03T23:41:19.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>City 3-1 Arsenal: Aguero hattrick sees Pep's side two points off top</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-02-03T23:41:19.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Raheem Sterling,Sergio Aguero,Premier League,Manchester City,Kevin De Bruyne,Arsenal,Match Report,Pep Guardiola</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/03/20/9340716-0-image-a-3_1549226633417.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sportsnews/article-6661473/Emiliano-Sala-pawn-sordid-transfer-shames-football.html" title="Four agents trying to get their cut and a tangled web of owners of the doomed plane...

European Tour chief executive Keith Pelley stepped in and, after hearing from all sides, issued a disqualification that is believed to have no precedent. </dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Derek Lawrenson for The Mail on Sunday</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-02-03T14:00:46.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Garcia disqualified from Saudi International for damaging FIVE greens</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-02-03T14:00:46.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/02/14/9309008-0-image-a-151_1549117285752.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1147327</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Getty Images</mi:licensorName></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-6659125/Justin-Rose-suffers-rare-missed-cut-inaugural-Saudi-International.html" title="Justin Rose suffers a rare missed cut as Dustin Johnson surges clear at the inaugural Saudi International"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-6653951/Thomas-Pieters-leads-Saudi-international-seven-par-63-Justin-Rose-toils-greens.html" title="Thomas Pieters leads Saudi international with seven-under par 63 as Justin Rose toils on the greens "></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-6645281/Eddie-Pepperell-defends-decision-contest-Saudi-International.html" title="'You could argue every country has at some point exemplified the worst that human beings have to offer': Eddie Pepperell defends decision to contest at Saudi International after the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-6642075/World-No-1-Rose-three-years-five-year-plan-complete-golfer-majors.html" title="World No 1 Justin Rose is three years into a five-year plan to be the complete golfer... now for the majors  "></atom:link></item><item><title>Tottenham 1-0 Newcastle: Heung-min Son grabs vital late winner to overcome stubborn Magpies and send Spurs up to second in the Premier League</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6660477/Tottenham-1-0-Newcastle-Son-Heung-min-grabs-vital-late-goal-hosts.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Feb 2019 14:21:46 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6660477</guid><description><![CDATA[MATT BARLOW AT WEMBLEY: Tottenham summoned yet another late winner to beat Newcastle and ease past Manchester City into second place in the Premier League.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="mol-para-with-font">The dogged refusal to accept one point when three might still be available is not a characteristic readily applied to Tottenham over the years but if one man personifies this never-say-die spirit it is Son Heung-min.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even on a day when Son was subdued and well shackled for long periods by Newcastle’s excellent defensive unit, it was highly appropriate the Korean should spring up to deliver the late winner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was his ninth goal in 10 appearances for Spurs and it came with an assist from Fernando Llorente, who fought the ball down and laid it off.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/02/14/9309564-6660477-image-m-101_1549118936295.jpg" height="713" width="962" alt="Heung-min Son scored his second goal in two games to earn Tottenham a vital victory over Newcastle at Wembley" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/02/14/9309628-0-image-a-100_1549118926636.jpg" height="603" width="962" alt="" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox sport" data-version="2" id="mol-bbba4010-273b-11e9-a34f-e9d586d5a4f1">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">MATCH FACTS, LIVE LEAGUE TABLE AND MATCH ZONE</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <div class="cleared row mol-cols mol-cols-3" id="mol-bbbadc50-273b-11e9-a34f-e9d586d5a4f1">                            <div class="mol-col span4 mol-col-1" style="style">                                <div class="cleared mol-col-content"><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR (4-3-3): </strong>Lloris 6;

No, the idea was for promising youngsters at the big clubs to be farmed out for first-team experience while giving a helping hand to teams lower down the divisions.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Jeff Powell for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-02-01T00:02:38.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>JEFF POWELL: Loan system was not designed for Chelsea to sign Higuain</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-02-01T00:02:38.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Premier League</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/31/23/9252040-0-image-a-71_1548977408605.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1362851</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Kieran McManus/BPI/REX</mi:licensorName></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6654813/MARTIN-SAMUEL-Sarri-ball-needs-time-hes-wrong-club.html" title="If Sarri-ball needs time, he's at the wrong club... time is the one luxury Chelsea managers never get"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6655439/Celtic-bolster-squad-Borussia-Dortmund-ace-Jeremy-Toljan-loan-end-season.html" title="Celtic bolster squad with Borussia Dortmund ace Jeremy Toljan on loan until the end of the season"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6524729/Premier-League-Transfers-Club-club-list-January-2019-moves.html" title="Premier League transfer window: Your comprehensive club-by-club list of the January moves in 2019"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6655153/Mike-Ashley-turn-attention-future-Rafa-Benitez-breaking-Newcastles-transfer-record.html" title="Mike Ashley turns attention to the future of boss Rafa Benitez after backing the Newcastle manager by breaking the club's transfer record"></atom:link></item><item><title>If Sarri-ball needs time, he's at the wrong club... time is the one luxury Chelsea managers never get</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6654813/MARTIN-SAMUEL-Sarri-ball-needs-time-hes-wrong-club.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 22:33:22 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6654813</guid><description><![CDATA[MARTIN SAMUEL - CHIEF SPORTS WRITER: If Chelsea's players lack motivation, it is the motivation to believe in what Maurizio Sarri commands. So it's them, but it's him as well.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="mol-para-with-font">It is not about motivation, it is the system. If the system functions, no elite club loses 4-0 to Bournemouth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If Chelsea's players lack motivation, it is the motivation to believe in what Maurizio Sarri commands. So it's them, but it's very much him as well. It is his grand plan that has been rumbled — and in record time, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It took English football years to combat what Dave Bassett was attempting at Wimbledon, but Sarri-ball in its first inception was as good as over three months in, on November 24, 2018, when Mauricio Pochettino detailed <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/dele-alli/index.html" id="mol-36c22f60-25a8-11e9-a0e7-69f05ec896f2">Dele Alli</a> to shut off Chelsea's supply line through Jorginho and the system fell apart.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/31/20/9244176-6654813-image-a-14_1548967102972.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="It is Maurizio Sarri's grand plan at Chelsea that has been rumbled — and in record time, too" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is what Aaron Ramsey did for Arsenal on the day Chelsea looked so toothless in defeat at the Emirates. On Wednesday night, it was the job Eddie Howe gave to David Brooks, a 21-year-old Welsh international, late of Sheffield United.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brooks is a fine prospect but any system that can be so spectacularly negated by a forward with 21 starts in the Premier League and a team of players, none of whom could be imagined in a Chelsea shirt, isn't as smart as it thinks it is or as smart as a lot of people think it is.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For there is very heavy investment in Sarri-ball working, mainly by the type of football analysts that Graeme Souness scornfully dismisses as bluffers: those who believe statistical sheets ahead of what they see with their own eyes, that think football has been reinvented by a handful of modern coaches and no one previously split the centre halves or the strikers, or played out from the back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Malcolm Allison was coaching goalkeepers to kick the ball properly and pass, better to start a quick counter-attack, 50 years ago. There is very little that is new under the sun.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It comes as a surprise to the bluffers when Luka Modric stands up having won the Ballon D'Or and thanks, not Zinedine Zidane or some obscure European coach with a cult philosophy and a spread of disciples, but Harry Redknapp for changing his position and his game.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Equally, while Pochettino undoubtedly showed the way, it was Howe, an English coach quietly working a minor miracle on the south coast, who took Chelsea apart with inferior players.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/31/20/9244248-6654813-image-a-15_1548967166085.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Chelsea fell to a 4-0 defeat by Bournemouth in the Premier League on Wednesday evening" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet you won't have to look far on Friday morning for a well-constructed treatise on how the critics are wrong about Sarri-ball, how much time it takes to work and how Jorginho is actually having a wonderful season, despite increasing evidence to the contrary.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most midfield possession won, most successful passes of any player in Europe apparently and no one is suggesting Jorginho is a failure, more that he is just not good enough in his first season to carry an entire strategy in a league far stronger, faster and more physically demanding than Serie A.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Roy Hodgson has reached 71 as a top-level manager, so one imagines is in rude health. If you want to test his blood pressure, however, start tossing out statistics without context. He can get quite prickly, Roy, if he hears about percentage possession without a mention of where it occurs on the pitch and that's what Jorginho's numbers often lack: context.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/31/21/9246028-6654813-image-a-32_1548969128670.jpg" height="457" width="634" alt="When Dele Alli shut off Chelsea's supply line through Jorginho, the system fell apart" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">His passes total 2,136 in 23 Premier League matches, at an average of 92.8 per game. Yet the way Chelsea operate, the play invariably goes through him. Jorginho keeps them ticking over, changing angles, changing approach lines, always available, drawing players towards him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He makes the most passes of any player in Europe for that reason so, naturally, he makes more forward passes, too. Does that by definition make him attack-minded, though? Not necessarily.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jorginho has made 530 forward passes this season, which initially seems impressive, but that's only a quarter of his output. He hits almost as many passes backwards (270) and astray (209) and more than half his total passes (1,127), travel sideways, as anyone who watches Chelsea will testify.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How many Jorginho passes have created chances this season? Just 15 — making him the 460th most potent player in the major European leagues. With how many assists? None.</p><video preload="none" id="1852962" title="Maurizio Sarri is at a loss following defeat against Bournemouth" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/30/23/video-9202050-60_636x358.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/01/30/2315127916895845760/1024x576_MP4_2315127916895845760.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/31/20/9244276-6654813-image-a-16_1548967277580.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Most worryingly, if Sarri-ball needs time, then he is at the wrong club " /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The counter-argument is that Jorginho is not there to play that final, killer pass, but to light the fire, to keep the Sarri-ball bouncing. Yet what of Chelsea when this doesn't happen? What is the strategy when Jorginho is removed from the game by a manager such as Howe, who might not have a philosophy named after him, but seems to know his football just the same?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Is Sarri a genius or a myth? If he is such a great coach, why can't he keep David Luiz's head in the game, why can't he get Willian playing as he did under Jose Mourinho, why can't he adapt and get the best from N'Golo Kante? If Sarri is the master coach, why does he have a single way of setting up?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most worryingly, if Sarri-ball needs time, then he is at the wrong club, because time is the one luxury Chelsea managers never get. Not from the players, certainly not from the owner who has now suffered his first defeat by a four-goal margin since arriving at Stamford Bridge in 2003.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Equally, if Sarri truly believes motivation is Chelsea's only problem that is problematic, because it sounds as if the willingness to make even a small alteration is not there.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So Chelsea sink or swim as they are. That may make Sarri a principled coach, but it doesn't necessarily make him a great one.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><strong>Stan's rams offer Arsenal no hope</strong></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">That the dead hand of Stan Kroenke's stewardship has not been able to prevent the Los Angeles Rams contesting the Super Bowl on Sunday is testament to the rules the NFL have in place to ensure open competition. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If similar incentives were in place here, there might be hope for Arsenal.

Had he gone, had he made the trip to watch his new Cardiff team-mates, then Sala would not have returned to Nantes to say goodbye to old friends and would not have disappeared from the radar in poor weather, inside a small plane, with its pilot Dave Ibbotson.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Deep down, Warnock must know he isn't really to blame. It's sliding doors. Whenever a tragic event occurs we imagine the twists and turns, the little decisions that could have prevented it. That train which was missed, the one that was caught, how different would a life have turned out?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Had Warnock insisted his new signing traveled north with the team, he would have saved him — but how could he have known that?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The night Harry Redknapp's best friend from Bournemouth, Brian Tiler, died in a road accident, the pair had swapped seats on their minibus. Redknapp had kept the group waiting and, to jokingly punish him, Tiler took his favourite pew. Redknapp survived the head-on collision, Tiler died. It took him a long time to come to terms with that. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/31/20/9244166-6654813-image-a-19_1548967612002.jpg" height="431" width="634" alt="Neil Warnock still feels guilt over not inviting Emiliano Sala to Newcastle two weekends ago" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">There have been all manner of reports emanating from Cardiff since Sala's disappearance — that the club will demand an investigation into how their player came to be flying in an unsuitable craft in treacherous conditions, that they are considering a compensatory claim of negligence to recoup £14million losses. Warnock, understandably, does not appear very interested in any of it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet there will be an appropriate time for reflection one day, not just for Warnock, or Cardiff, but for everyone in football and a question that may be asked is: when football clubs invest in employees to the tune of millions of pounds, is it not strange that they do not also assume control of other areas of their professional lives?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cardiff offered to bring back Sala from Nantes, but would only do so on commercial flights. Might they have been more insistent had they known the alternate arrangement being made? Might decisions be made to minimise risk over the cars players drive, the flights they take, the pace of the lifestyle the modern game gives them? Sergio Aguero had a crash speeding to catch a private plane after attending a pop concert in a foreign country.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A specialist insurance broker exists for footballers who wish to buy cars they would never otherwise be allowed to drive. The money affords a glamorous life, maybe it should also afford wise counsel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What befell Sala was a tragic accident and nobody's fault, but that is not the same as saying it could not have been avoided.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><strong>Fellaini: Not pretty, but pretty effective </strong></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Marouane Fellaini's departure is being heralded as further evidence of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's positive influence on Manchester United.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Never a United player was the collective wisdom as Fellaini left for China. He seemingly embodied all that was wrong with previous, failed, unpopular regimes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A little unfair, that. It wasn't just Jose Mourinho who came to lean on Fellaini in a crisis. David Moyes brought him to the club and, if anything, his best years were under Louis van Gaal when he was used in a very unorthodox fashion as an advanced midfield target man.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/31/20/9243960-6654813-image-a-21_1548967796534.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="It would be churlish to suggest Marouane Fellaini never brought anything to the party" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">United would go long, but to Fellaini, not a forward, and he would hold the ball up in a deep, central position. It wasn't necessarily the United way but it was, for a while, very effective. As was throwing Fellaini on late to cause carnage in the box, and nick a late winner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is Marcus Rashford's wonderful skill that wins the Europa League quarter-final with Anderlecht in 2017, but it is Fellaini's presence in the box that tees him up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was significant throughout that successful run, not least in the final with Ajax, and on a number of occasions came to United's rescue.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No, United do not play that way any longer. If Solskjaer wanted to put it in the mixer — and he probably doesn't — he has two significant upgrades on Fellaini in Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet there was something about Fellaini, an awkwardness, an ungainly physicality that presented a unique challenge. He had that old cliche, good feet for a big man, too. Fellaini might not be missed as United march towards their sunlit uplands under Solskjaer, but it would be churlish to suggest he never brought anything to the party. He did, but it wasn't pretty.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/31/20/9243964-6654813-image-a-23_1548967982084.jpg" height="547" width="634" alt="Fellaini (second left) and his team set off for China after his transfer to Shandong Luneng" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><strong>Why can't Eddie try something different? </strong></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">England are unlikely to win in Dublin on Saturday but that does not mean Eddie Jones's attempts to revolutionise rugby thinking are wrong. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By starting Jack Nowell at wing, with the freedom to join as a flanker would at the breakdown, he is at least challenging rugby's orthodoxy, and the rigidly enforced player roles.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why, in theory, can't Nowell operate as a back or a forward?

Now imagine that strategy if it only became apparent an hour before the game.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That there was no advance warning in selection, no advance publicity at all. That a rugby coach could shock as a football coach can, by using a player in an innovative fashion, by refusing to conform to convention?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">England look to be over-matched by an Irish team that may yet end the year as world champions — in which case a smart coach needs all the help he can get.

Reading rejected their top offer of £500,000 and Wigan boss Paul Cook signed Danny Fox from Forest, which sparked a move by Martin ONeill for Blackett.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Matt Barlow for MailOnline</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-31T16:09:49.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Reading winning battle to keep Blackett amid Wigan + Forest interest</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-31T16:09:49.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Wigan Athletic,Reading</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/31/11/9221074-0-image-a-51_1548932751880.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1147327</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Getty Images</mi:licensorName></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6569381/Reading-REJECT-450-000-offer-Wigan-sign-former-Manchester-United-defender-Tyler-Blackett.html" title="Reading reject £450,000 offer from Wigan to sign former Manchester United defender Tyler Blackett"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6542997/Premier-League-clubs-eye-January-Tammy-Abraham.html" title="Premier League clubs eye up January move for Tammy Abraham as Chelsea consider ending striker's successful loan spell at Aston Villa "></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6542647/Wigan-preparing-400-000-offer-Reading-defender-Tyler-Blackett.html" title="Wigan preparing £400,000 offer for Reading defender Tyler Blackett with Stoke and Middlesbrough also keen"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6531107/Championship-round-West-Brom-pressure-two-Middlesbrough-slip-up.html" title="Championship round-up: West Brom keep up pressure on top two as Middlesbrough slip up against managerless Sheffield Wednesday "></atom:link></item><item><title>Maurizio Sarri finds his job at Chelsea on the line after thumping defeat at the hands of Bournemouth</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6650649/Maurizio-Sarri-finds-job-Chelsea-line-Bournemouth-loss.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 22:30:14 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6650649</guid><description><![CDATA[MATT LAWTON: Maurizio Sarri is battling to save his job after Chelsea were thrashed 4-0 at Bournemouth on Wednesday night.

And maybe next time the tension that engulfed Anfield as the scores stayed level will be eased by a second goal. If it is not, though, expect more of the same.

City needed lousy defending from Newcastle to take the lead after 24 seconds, for Liverpool, it was almost like Leicester were not there at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their opening goal, scored after two minutes, came after 28 successive Liverpool touches. In that 121-second period, Leicester had the ball once.

Brave man, Mane. There can’t be too many days like this in the Sedhiou region of Senegal, from where he originates, but he was one of the few out there wearing a short-sleeved shirt in the sub-zero conditions. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With so many passes completed it wouldn’t be right to say he started the move per se, but he started the business end of it. He sent the ball out to Andrew Robertson, who in turn found Firmino, recycling it to Mane once more. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now inside the Leicester area, Mane cut inside and guided his low shot around Kasper Schmeichel into the far corner. Anfield exploded with joy, and no little relief. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even a four-point cushion isn’t enough to completely calm the nerves, but an early advantage was just what the doctor ordered: a calming pill. Mane must have felt it, too. He knelt down and kissed the snow-flecked turf.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Liverpool continued to dominate as Leicester initially defended too deep and looked like they might add a second. In the sixth minute, Jordan Henderson – deputising at right back, ever the thinking man’s journeyman – found Mo Salah whose deep cross picked out Firmino, forcing a fine save from Schmeichel. From the corner Mane headed just wide.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Slowly, however, as at Newcastle, the game changed. Leicester came into it, Liverpool failed to capitalise. Joel Matip was booked for a cynical challenge high up the field on Jamie Vardy, who otherwise might have been away.

It ended up with Marc Albrighton who returned it as a dangerous, deep cross which picked out James Maddison.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you ever wonder why strikers are paid the most money, here was the answer. The goal was open, the equaliser was on. Yet instead of taking the responsibility, Maddison seemed to want to bring in Vardy instead. His header, which should have been directed towards the gaping target, ended up neither one thing nor the other, and missed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the 41st minute, Leicester delivered a cynical payback for Matip’s early offence when Robertson looked to have put Mane in, only for Harry Maguire to tug him back and take the booking for the team. Then, in the final attack of the match, the break-out star of England’s World Cup campaign showed the finer side to his game. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was a goal from nowhere, but impressively taken. Robertson conceded a free-kick on Leicester’s right flank, which Maddison whipped in. The ball was blocked and cleared, but only as far as left-back Ben Chilwell. He headed it back and suddenly it was with Maguire, in so much space Anfield fondly imagined he must be offside. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nowhere near. Maguire controlled and slotted the ball past Alisson. Nobody has the title won in January; and nobody wins it smiling and waving happily to the crowd without breaking sweat. As if Klopp needed reminding.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>MARTIN SAMUEL AT ANFIELD: Look, it’s far from the end of the world. This stuff happens in a title race. Good teams drop points, inferiors spring surprises. And Leicester aren’t bad, either. The league table on Thursday morning still shows Liverpool five points clear, and what manager wouldn’t take that with 14 games remaining? Yet there is significance here, too. It isn’t going to be easy. Liverpool can still be caught, can still appear vulnerable. Their last league game here was a 4-3 win over Crystal Palace that was every bit as fraught as it sounds; as was this.  Anyone imagining that Manchester City’s defeat at Newcastle had as good as decided the title race was always likely to be in for a rude awakening. Maybe we just thought Liverpool’s twitch would come later rather than sooner.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Martin Samuel for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-31T00:53:07.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Liverpool 1-1 Leicester: Maguire's strike cancels Mane's early opener</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-31T00:53:07.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Premier League,Liverpool,Mohamed Salah,Leicester City,Jurgen Klopp</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/30/22/9200124-0-image-a-9_1548888027185.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6652891/Wolves-11-4m-Iranian-Messi-Sardar-Azmoun-off.html" title="Wolves' £11.4m move for 'Iranian Messi' Sardar Azmoun off after club fail to agree terms with Rubin Kazan "></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6649503/Liverpool-vs-Leicester-LIVE-Klopp-looks-seven-points-ahead-Premier-League-title-race.html" title="Liverpool 1-1 Leicester, RESULT – Jurgen Klopp’s Reds go five points clear of Manchester City in the Premier League title race"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6649389/Manchester-City-players-shrug-Newcastle-defeat-striking-pose.html" title="Manchester City players shrug off Newcastle defeat by striking a pose as Pep Guardiola's side prepare to bounce back in the title race"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6647897/Liverpool-love-former-manager-Rafa-Benitez-Newcastle-win-Manchester-City.html" title="‘Once a Red, always a Red’: Liverpool love-in for former manager Rafa Benitez on Twitter after Newcastle dent Manchester City's title ambitions"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6646563/Pep-Guardiola-refuses-Premier-League-title-Man-Citys-shock-defeat-Newcastle.html" title="'It’s January, it’s not April or May.

Even Mauricio Pochettino got involved, grabbing the Spanish striker as he ran past him on an adrenaline-fuelled celebration run.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Matt Barlow for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-31T00:25:17.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Tottenham 2-1 Watford: Llorente strikes late to win it for hosts</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-31T00:25:17.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Tottenham Hotspur,Premier League,Watford</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/30/22/9200128-0-image-a-6_1548887989668.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6649551/LIVE-SCORES-Bournemouth-vs-Chelsea-PLUS-Tottenham-vs-Watford-Southampton-Crystal-vs-Palace.html" title="Bournemouth vs Chelsea, RECAP – Cherries stun Blues at the Vitality Stadium, as Spurs leave it late to beat Hornets and Saints make a late point"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6648887/Manchester-United-legend-Gary-Neville-reveals-six-month-struggle-break-up.html" title="'My belief went...

Yes again. Not only because he beat him but because Groves acknowledges Chunky's Olympic gold talent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He's very good,' says Groves.

'I want to see if I can be great at something else,' he says.

Draws at home to teams from the wrong end of the Premier League do not generally take big clubs where they want to go. But at United now mood is everything and the manner in way this point was won will not do Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his players very much harm at all. United were poor and did not deserve much. All the big performances came from Burnley. Goalkeeper Tom Heaton – once of United – was magnificent and central defenders Ben Mee and James Tarkowski were not very far behind. </dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ian Ladyman for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-30T00:30:04.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Man United 2-2 Burnley: Lindelof rescues point in stoppage time</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-30T00:30:04.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Romelu lukaku,Anthony Martial,Alexis Sanchez,Marouane Fellaini,David De Gea,Marcus Rashford,Burnley,Paul Pogba,Premier League,Manchester United</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/30/00/9157104-0-image-a-58_1548807236972.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6645309/Manchester-United-vs-Burnley-LIVE-score-updates-Old-Trafford.html" title="Manchester United 2-2 Burnley, RESULT: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side produce stunning late comeback to earn draw at Old Trafford"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6643923/Marouane-Fellaini-set-end-six-year-spell-Manchester-United.html" title="Marouane Fellaini set to end five-and-a-half-year spell at Manchester United as he closes in on multi-million pound move to China after falling out of favour under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6644081/Man-United-flop-Memphis-Depay-names-clubs-wants-join.html" title="'Real Madrid, Barcelona, Chelsea, Manchester City, PSG or Bayern Munich': The clubs Manchester United flop Memphis Depay wants to join as he looks for move away from Lyon"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6640915/Burnley-planning-moves-attacking-reinforcements.html" title="Burnley planning moves for attacking reinforcements with Sean Dyche eyeing Birmingham striker Che Adams and Tottenham's Vincent Janssen"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6645179/Tweet-2017-Man-United-goalkeeper-Lee-Grant-faced-Kylian-Mbappe-resurfaces.html" title="‘Lee Grant stays tall and denies the forward’: Bizarre Stoke tweet from 2017 when Manchester United goalkeeper faced Kylian Mbappe in a pre-season friendly resurfaces… and now fans want him to start in Champions League clash against PSG!

This was one of City's poorest performances of the season, at a time when they could afford it least.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Newcastle, meanwhile, can take great heart from a result that propels them to 14th in the table. They needed it, too, considering the scorelines – Fulham’s revival against Brighton, Burnley’s draw at Old Trafford. Yet these were the unlikeliest points of all, given City’s form going into this match. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They had scored 29 goals without reply across all competitions before this – breaking a record held by Preston North End from Queen Victoria’s day. And when the 30th took just 24 seconds to arrive, few gave Newcastle a prayer of holding out the remaining 89 minutes and 36 seconds without letting in at least one more.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The spikiness of their reaction, then – particularly given the difficult circumstances surrounding the club, with mutinous cries against owner Mike Ashley a permanent backdrop – is to be admired. True, in the second half before Newcastle scored, goalkeeper Martin Dubravka had made two impressive saves, from Raheem Sterling and David Silva, but even for the long periods when City led and looked comfortable, Newcastle were not out of it. </p><video preload="none" id="1852120" title="Pep Guardiola downcast after Manchester City lose to Newcastle" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/29/23/video-9155190-753_636x358.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/01/29/2788374887514027019/1024x576_MP4_2788374887514027019.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/29/20/9146326-0-image-a-22_1548792707180.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Sergio Aguero gave Manchester City the lead after just 24 seconds against Newcastle at St James' Park on Tuesday night" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/29/20/9146350-0-image-a-25_1548792710456.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="The Argentinian striker wheels away after scoring the quickest goal of the Premier league season, his 17th of the campaign" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/29/20/9146358-0-image-a-26_1548792713850.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="City players rush to congratulate the No 10 after netting for the 15th time in his career against the North East club " /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/29/20/9147304-6645927-image-a-37_1548794224662.jpg" height="636" width="962" alt="Kevin De Bruyne argues with referee Paul Tierney after he is shown a yellow card for taking a free-kick too quickly" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/29/20/9147298-6645927-image-a-34_1548794122972.jpg" height="574" width="962" alt="Makeshift full back Matt Ritchie sends Raheem Sterling flying after a late challenge on the England international" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/29/20/9147322-6645927-image-a-36_1548794125976.jpg" height="658" width="962" alt="The City winger returns the favour as he sends the Scotland international sprawling, giving away a free-kick in the process " /><p class="mol-para-with-font">They should have been, though, given the events in the first minute. The talk pre-match was of Miguel Almiron, a Paraguayan midfield player arriving from Atlanta United for a fee in the region of £20m – a new club record. If reports are correct, he will have his medical in the next 48 hours. Judging by the first minute, however, reinforcements of any description cannot come soon enough. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No doubt Benitez’s gameplan involved keeping it tight against a team that is prolific in front of goal. If so, oh Lordy. It was Manchester City’s fastest goal since Jesus Navas scored after 13 seconds against Tottenham in November 2013 and the fastest of the Premier League season so far. What were Newcastle thinking?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Raheem Sterling floated in a straightforward deep cross from the right. No defender dealt with it and it was left to goalkeeper Dubravka to smother at the far post. It was hard to see whether David Silva bravely stooped in to head the ball back across goal, or lost his footing and gamely improvised. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Either way, it had a double whammy effect – the header finding Sergio Aguero and the effort taking Silva into Dubravka and the goalkeeper out of the game. Even that might not have been calamitous had any Newcastle defender been capable of standing up to Aguero. No chance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Benitez looked disgusted. Yet, by the end of the half, so did Guardiola. He probably couldn’t believe it took his team until the 44th minute to get in behind Newcastle again, when Leroy Sane had a header from a Danilo cross cleared off the line. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Adding to the frustration would have been an incident in the 17th minute when Sterling was upended and Kevin De Bruyne stood over the free-kick. Referee Paul Tierney may have told him to wait for the whistle, but De Bruyne whipped in a lovely ball that Aguero turned in at the far post. No goal – but to add insult to injury, Tierney then booked De Bruyne for jumping the gun.  </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/29/21/9148976-6645927-image-a-38_1548795695617.jpg" height="685" width="962" alt="Opposing strikers Aguero and Rondon find themselves in the same half as the Venezuelan tries to keep possession" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/29/21/9148992-6645927-image-a-41_1548795769183.jpg" height="593" width="962" alt="Jamaal Lascelles, the Newcastle captain, attempts to head the ball goalwards but can't get there ahead of John Stones" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/29/21/9148998-6645927-image-a-43_1548795873885.jpg" height="657" width="962" alt="Tierney shows a yellow card to Sterling after the No 7 hauls down United youngster Sean Longstaff inside the centre circle" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/29/21/9149026-6645927-image-a-46_1548795927964.jpg" height="574" width="962" alt="A rueful smile passes across the face of De Bruyne after he can't find either Aguero or Leroy Sane during league clash" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Quite how the team that had been wronged ended up with a yellow card, and the team that committed the foul received all the time in the world to regroup and repel, is a mystery that football’s authorities should address at the earliest opportunity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the meantime, Newcastle were slowly coming into it. Ayoze Perez gave City a scare, catching Danilo in possession and haring towards goal, before screwing his low shot wastefully wide. Soon after Salomon Rondon set up Christian Atsu, whose shot was deflected high into the night sky by John Stones, the ball coming to rest on the roof of the City net.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Still no upping of the ante from City, which is how, in the 66th minute, Newcastle could equalise. From Guardiola’s point of view, the goal was an utter shambles. A header clear went as far as Isaac Hayden, who returned it with a looping header of his own. City reacted dismally, lacking urgency or appealing fruitlessly for offside. Amid the confusion, Salomon Rondon stayed calm. As the ball dropped, he struck it with his right foot, powering it into the ground and on a cold night with a hard surface, sending it over goalkeeper Ederson, in one mighty bounce.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even then, the money was on City. Newcastle’s equaliser would be a wake-up call, teasing the monster out of the champions. There were 24 minutes to go and they had previously only needed 24 seconds. It was show time. Instead, Newcastle scored a second.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fernandinho was caught in possession, panicked and sent Sean Longstaff tumbling. Tierney quite rightly pointed to the spot. Matt Ritchie stepped up to take it but, first, an unwelcome interlude. Ederson required treatment. A real injury? A psychological ploy? Who knew?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The wait must have seemed interminable, not just here at St James’ Park but over on Merseyside, the time and tension as Ritchie stood over the ball with Newcastle, and Liverpool, fans waiting for the denouement must have stretched across an agonising age. If Ritchie scored, and Newcastle held on, January 29, 2019, could become the day Liverpool’s first Premier League title at last felt like reality.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And score, he did. Ritchie held his nerve and slipped the ball under Ederson, to his right. City stumbled when it was least expected. This was supposed to be the match in which they shifted the pressure to Liverpool. Played first, won, and closed the gap to a single point. Over to you, Jurgen. Instead, it was City that were found wanting; and may not get the chance to close again.  </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/29/20/9146318-0-image-a-28_1548792716665.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Both sets of players stand on the centre circle as they take part in a minute's silence for Cardiff striker Emiliano Sala" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/29/20/9146314-0-image-a-21_1548792701638.jpg" height="643" width="962" alt="Newcastle fans hold posters protesting against owner Mike Ashley, who did not attend the Premier League clash" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/29/20/9146334-0-image-a-30_1548792724953.jpg" height="643" width="962" alt="Rafael Benitez and Pep Guardiola share an embrace before kick off at St James' Park on a chilly evening in the North East " />]]></content:encoded><dc:description>MARTIN SAMUEL AT ST JAMES' PARK: It is not over, but it is harder, from here. If Liverpool do their job at home to Leicester on Wednesday, and there is no reason why they should not, with such a weight off, the gap at the top will be seven points. Not insurmountable, but an advantage that any good team should hope to close out. And Liverpool are a good team. So are Manchester City, but not on Tuesday night. Given every advantage against a struggling Newcastle side, they failed to take the game on, much less the challenge.  Credit Rafael Benitez for that, of course. He sets his teams up well and despite the hindrance of conceding after just 24 seconds, ensured his players remained in the game long enough to win it. Newcastle were not lucky, or undeserving.  </dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Martin Samuel for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-30T01:41:15.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Newcastle 2-1 Manchester City: Benitez's side stun reigning champions</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-30T01:41:15.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Pep Guardiola,Sergio Aguero,Ederson Moraes,Gabriel jesus,Kevin De Bruyne,Premier League,Newcastle United,Manchester City,Raheem Sterling</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/29/22/9153082-0-image-a-89_1548800847336.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6645309/Manchester-United-vs-Burnley-RESULT-score-updates-Old-Trafford.html" title="Manchester United 2-2 Burnley, RESULT: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side produce stunning late comeback to earn draw at Old Trafford"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6645383/Premier-League-LIVE-Arsenal-vs-Cardiff-Newcastle-vs-Man-City-rest.html" title="Premier League, RESULTS – Newcastle 2-1 Manchester City and the rest of the night's action as Matt Ritchie penalty helps Toon come from behind to defeat champions at St James' Park"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6645559/Newcastle-set-break-transfer-record-Atlanta-Uniteds-Miguel-Almiron.html" title="Newcastle set to break 13-year-old transfer record as they strike deal to sign Atlanta United's Miguel Almiron  "></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6644081/Man-United-flop-Memphis-Depay-names-clubs-wants-join.html" title="'Real Madrid, Barcelona, Chelsea, Manchester City, PSG or Bayern Munich': The clubs Manchester United flop Memphis Depay wants to join as he looks for move away from Lyon"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6644501/Manchester-City-stars-make-140-mile-trip-Newcastle-private-jet.html" title="Manchester City stars make 140-mile trip to Newcastle on private jet as Pep Guardiola's men look to cut Liverpool's lead at the top of the table to one point"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6641571/Only-four-teams-tried-attack-Manchester-City-season-claims-Pep-Guardiola.html" title="Only four teams have tried to attack Manchester City this season claims Pep Guardiola as he prepares for Newcastle to sit back at St James' Park "></atom:link></item><item><title>Brentford forward Ollie Watkins set to escape ban despite accusations he dived to win a penalty against Barnet</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6646025/Brentford-forward-Ollie-Watkins-set-escape-ban-despite-accusations-dived-win-penalty.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2019 21:10:36 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6646025</guid><description><![CDATA[Ollie Watkins is set to escape a ban despite accusations he dived to win a penalty in Brentford's FA Cup fourth round tie at Barnet.

Tottenham were always a big club, because Tottenham won trophies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That's what big clubs do. They don't just play in the Champions League each season. They win the big matches, they win the big prizes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Start with the ones Chas and Dave celebrated: FA Cup (1901), FA Cup (1921), League title (1951), League and FA Cup double (1961), League Cup (1971), FA Cup (1981). Then consider the others that don't fit neatly into numerical repetition or a catchy pub rock chorus: FA Cup in 1962, 1967 and 1982; League Cup in 1973 (and later in 1999 and 2008); European Cup-winners' Cup in 1963; UEFA Cup in 1972 and 1984.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cups are only good for the ego, Mauricio Pochettino says, but that is not the limit of their influence. The reason Tottenham can build, and fill, a 60,000-capacity stadium, the reason they can attract 80,000 to major matches at Wembley, is because they have the fan base of a big club — and they grew that by winning trophies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, we know, fourth is a trophy these days, too. Can't display it in a cabinet, or parade it on an open-top bus, but it is there on the balance sheet and in the fixture schedule for the new season.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pochettino is right. Had he won the League Cup and finished consistently mid-table, he would have been sacked. Establishing Tottenham in the Champions League will feel to him as huge as any trophy. </p><video preload="none" id="1850146" title="Mauricio Pochettino: &amp;#39;It&amp;#39;s time to win some trophies&amp;#39;" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/27/19/video-9052030-452_636x358.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/01/29/4282850211900638360/1024x576_MP4_4282850211900638360.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/28/21/9100822-6641703-image-a-40_1548710283460.jpg" height="381" width="634" alt="It has been a disappointing week for Tottenham having been eliminated from two competitons" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It means Tottenham return to White Hart Lane as a different entity. A big club, yes, but big on numbers, big on paper, not big in the way of a club that wins trophies. Not big like Manchester United, even when they sit outside the top four.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had it right, again, when asked the extent of his ambition at Manchester United. 'We are looking to win trophies,' he said. 'Top four will never be the dream for Manchester United.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, that's easy for him to say. At Arsenal on Friday, Solskjaer had the luxury of leaving Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial to rest on the substitutes' bench, and starting Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pochettino by contrast has Harry Kane and Dele Alli out injured, and Son Heung-min returning from international tournament duty with South Korea. Tottenham's resources do not compare to those of Manchester United.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then again, when did they? When have Tottenham ever been the club with the most money? It has never stopped them before.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pochettino is deserving of sympathy and no little respect. Everyone acknowledges the job he has done at Tottenham. Yet qualifying for the Champions League and winning a domestic cup competition should not be regarded as mutually exclusive. Other clubs do it, because that is the mark of elite membership.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/28/21/9100802-6641703-image-a-41_1548710292171.jpg" height="408" width="634" alt="Pochettino lacks the depth of rivals but  trophies and top four should not be mutually exclusive" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since 2002-03 when Premier League entry to the Champions League became a minimum of four clubs each season, five have accounted for 63 of England's places. Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea have been in 15 times each, Liverpool on 10 occasions, Manchester City eight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During that period Chelsea have won five FA Cups and three League Cups, Manchester United two FA Cups and four League Cups, Arsenal five FA Cups, Manchester City one FA Cup and three League Cups and Liverpool one FA Cup and two League Cups. This season's League Cup will go to either Manchester City or Chelsea, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So it is possible to remain in the top four and win a cup. It is not just about an ego trip for the manager, or players — it is an intrinsic part of the profile of an elite club. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tottenham's only trophy in this period is the League Cup in 2008, won before the club began qualifying for the modern Champions League.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pochettino's implication is that the top-four finish takes it all out of them, and there is no room for anything else. Yet there used to be. In five of their cup-winning seasons, Tottenham finished high enough to have qualified for the modern Champions League.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/28/21/158E505C00000514-6641703-image-a-43_1548710528862.jpg" height="403" width="634" alt="Since 2002-03, Tottenham's only trophy was the League Cup win over Chelsea back in 2008" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">They won the FA Cup and came third in 1961-62, the European Cup-winners' Cup and second in 1962-63, the FA Cup and third in 1966-67, the League Cup and third in 1970-71 and the FA Cup and fourth in 1981-82. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Was English football any less competitive then? Clubs were often the best in Europe, and the league was certainly more open.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Equally, many more of Tottenham's rivals were as strong financially. Between 1961 and 1982, the British transfer record was broken 14 times — but only once by Tottenham, paying £200,000 for Martin Peters in March 1970. The following year, Arsenal topped that, for Alan Ball. In all, Tottenham were one of 11 English clubs capable of paying a record fee for a player in that period.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The others? Manchester United, Leicester, Leeds, Arsenal, Derby, Everton, West Brom, Nottingham Forest, Manchester City and Wolves. No sovereign wealth funds or oil money, but the competition was certainly out there.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps what is most dispiriting for any Tottenham fan who dreams of seeing a trophy held aloft at the town hall is that the tournaments that now matter most are the hardest to win. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/28/21/9101476-6641703-image-a-44_1548710584381.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="In Europe, the Pochettino years at Tottenham have largely been underwhelming for supporters" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tottenham's last league title came in 1961 and in the modern Champions League they have only once reached the last eight, under Harry Redknapp in 2011.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Pochettino years have been rather underwhelming: a group stage exit followed by defeat against Juventus in the last 16. There have been some great nights — not least the 3-1 home wins over Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund — but nothing that suggests Tottenham are ready to take on what Pochettino described as the last level.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their next Champions League opponents are Dortmund, Bundesliga leaders, and much improved in roughly 18 months since their last Wembley visit. In the previous seven seasons, Dortmund have made five appearances in Germany's cup final, winning it twice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It could be argued this is the more traditional and effective method of muscling in and remaining among elite company. It certainly suggests there is another way.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Hardy made a cock-up, that's all </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Modern man, it would seem, divides into two varieties: those who like to keep a picture of their penis handy on a smart-phone, perhaps for special occasions, and those who do not. Alan Hardy, chairman of Notts County, would appear to fall into the first category.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While on Twitter at the weekend, Hardy inadvertently included his phone's picture gallery, and an image he later described as 'inappropriate'. This depends. If the intention was to show that he is probably not the sort of person to be left in charge of the league's oldest football club, or with a camera phone while in the bath, it was entirely appropriate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hardy later put the club up for sale, claiming this decision had nothing at all to do with the unexpected appearance of the last turkey in the shop. There, amid much hilarity, is where the matter should end.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/28/21/9053596-6641703-Notts_County_owner_Alan_Hardy_has_announced_he_is_putting_the_cl-a-30_1548709547218.jpg" height="420" width="630" alt="Notts County owner Alan Hardy made a mistake when he tweeted a picture of his photo gallery" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, no. As ever the FA cannot so much as see a nut without reaching for the sledgehammer, and have now asked Hardy for his observations. What is the point of that? It's a mistake. Quite obviously, a mistake.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He didn't tweet a picture of his penis. He tweeted a screenshot that inadvertently included his camera roll which, for reasons unknown, included his penis. What is the FA's purpose here? To issue a charge?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Notts County are in dire financial straits, bottom of League Two. The owner is struggling to keep his club out of the National League and his penis out of the papers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Surely they, and he, have suffered enough, without the FA's disciplinary department seeking involvement.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Pep continues to make history at City </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">What have the following clubs got in common: Preston, Sunderland, Aston Villa, Sheffield Wednesday, Liverpool, Huddersfield, Arsenal, Portsmouth, Manchester United, Wolves, Chelsea, Blackburn Rovers, Newcastle, Tottenham and Nottingham Forest? Here's a clue: we could also throw in Wanderers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The answer is that each of them, at some point in their history, have retained a trophy. Not necessarily the league title — Blackburn, Newcastle and Tottenham have only retained cups — but on occasions something even grander, such as Forest's retention of the main European prize.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/28/20/9098436-0-image-a-26_1548707625176.jpg" height="503" width="634" alt="Manchester City's current crop are trying to retain a trophy for the first time in their history" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet there are some notable absences. Everton, for instance — and Manchester City. Meaning if City can overcome Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final next month, it will be the first trophy they have retained in their 124-year history.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is not to be underestimated; much like City's current run of 29 goals scored across all competitions, without reply. Incredibly, this beats a record that has resided with Preston since 1889-90.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Liverpool may lead the league but, under Pep Guardiola, City continue to make history, and should be admired for that.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">It has to be all or nothing when it comes to VAR </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first time Arsenal wore a yellow away shirt was the 1950 FA Cup final against Liverpool. That's how fair the competition used to be. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the event of a colour clash both teams had to switch to second kit — except Arsenal and Liverpool's away strips clashed, too. So Arsenal changed a second time, wearing yellow shirts, white shorts, and yellow and blue hooped socks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yellow eventually became their official change in 1968. Now, the FA Cup is so mixed up even individual ties are subject to different rules. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some matches have VAR, others do not. Some rounds have replays, others do not. Consistency is a must in football. The mess we saw across fourth round weekend should never be repeated. Either all in with VAR, or nothing. There should not be a ration on truth.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/28/21/9100022-6641703-image-a-29_1548709286374.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Every match should include VAR or none at all as football desperately needs some consistency" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Beth Tweddle, former Olympic gymnast, is suing the makers of television show 'The Jump' having fractured two vertebrae in training in 2016. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Good luck explaining to the judge that she didn't know ski-jumping could be dangerous and came with a risk of personal injury.

Coleman spoke of Moss being arrogant, and making horrendous decisions. He said the official 'scarpered into the lounge' ... 'Our dressing rooms probably weren't good enough for him,' he sneered.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps having been informed how this was likely to play out at the FA, Coleman later issued a statement expressing regret.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/28/20/9019390-0-Accrington_Stanley_boss_John_Coleman_was_furious_at_referee_Jon_-a-28_1548707674707.jpg" height="406" width="634" alt="Accrington Stanley manager John Coleman was left furious at referee Jon Moss on Saturday" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe he had also seen the incident in the 93rd minute, when his player, Sean McConville, committed quite the worst dive of the weekend.

Genuine football, full of honest, decent lads, better than these overpaid prima donnas.

I fulfilled my childhood ambition by winning the WBA world title (at the fourth attempt by stopping Fedor Chudinov two years ago) and that was always going to be the best moment of my career.' So it was, and a notable career at that.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/28/19/9095156-6641385-image-a-14_1548702601484.jpg" height="399" width="634" alt="Groves surprised the world of boxing by announcing his retirement aged 30 on Monday" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Groves also wants 'to spend some of my better days with my young family instead of becoming too old or too injured to box.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A realisation of the perils of boxing 'was brought home to me' when his victim of an earlier fight, Eduard Gutknecht, fell into a coma from which he has not fully recovered.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He adds that after the birth of his second son last year and the September loss to Smith in Saudi Arabia: 'The desire to fight had left me and the thought of retiring at 30 which I first had 10 years ago is still a good idea now.'

So it comes as no surprise to hear him say that he is bowing out 'when at the top of my game' after losing the world super-middleweight title to Callum Smith. Most fighters hate so much as the thought of going out on a defeat. Nor is it startling that he has hung up the gloves just as it appeared he was on the brink of a grudge rematch with James DeGale, which would have earned each of these west London arch-rivals another sizable deposit towards comfortable early retirement.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Jeff Powell for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-28T22:30:06.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Independent thinker George Groves bows out 'at the top of my game'</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-28T22:30:06.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/28/19/9095132-0-image-a-19_1548702866625.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1146016</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>PA</mi:licensorName></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-6639841/Former-world-super-middleweight-champion-George-Groves-30-announces-retirement-boxing.html" title="'I hope I have entertained you all': Former world super middleweight champion George Groves, 30, announces retirement from boxing "></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/mma/article-6637639/Conor-McGregor-buys-3million-personalised-yacht.html" title="Conor McGregor buys stunning £3million personalised yacht as Irishman continues to enjoy riches of his fighting career"></atom:link></item><item><title>Mauricio Pochettino DOES have cash to splash as he looks to breathe life back into Tottenham's season</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6641643/Mauricio-Pochettino-DOES-cash-splash-looks-breathe-life-Spurs-season.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jan 2019 22:30:06 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6641643</guid><description><![CDATA[Mauricio Pochettino does have money available to spend should he need it.

In 2017, I boxed in front of a home crowd in Sheffield and became the WBA super middleweight world champion. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After four attempts I had finally fulfilled my childhood dream, and the experience was as great as I had always imagined it would be. It was without doubt the best moment of my career. Some of you might think it odd that I'm choosing this time to retire. I'm still young, still fit and healthy, and there are still some big fights out there for me. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it's for these reasons that I am choosing to retire now. I have a young family at home; it's time to spend some of my better days with them. I don't want there to be a time where I'm 'too old' to box on, or where an injury retires me in or out of the ring. Over the years I have seen and sadly known the dangers of the sport, and I want to respectfully bow out while I'm at the top of my game. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I've learned that doesn't always mean coming off the back of a win. I've boxed at the highest level, all over the world, I've been a champion, and I'll be leaving the sport (relatively!) intact. Boxing has been good to me and I believe I have been good for boxing. I hope I have entertained you all; I have always strived to be the best fighter I can be. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although we step through the ropes on our own, of course every fighter is backed by a team, and not just the ones in the corner. There are many, many people that have helped me on my way to fulfilling my boxing dreams and I would like to take this opportunity to thank as many people as I can. Below are the people I would like to thank most, and a bit about how each and every one of them shaped me into the champion fighter I became. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I first began my journey into combat sport at the age of 7, with Jason Stevens at the Scorpion kick boxing club in Fulham. He instilled determination into me, and a champions work-ethic that separated me from kids my age and set me on my path. To all the coaches that I worked with at Dale Youth ABC; Mick Delaney, Peter Carson, Micky 'Northolt' Delaney and Ernie Harris. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I joined Dale at 10 years of age and instantly fell in love with boxing, making it my life's passion. Under their guidance I won 4 school boy titles, I captained Young England and Cadet England, and went on to win 2 senior ABA titles. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They instilled a winning mind-set in me and everyone else who walked through the doors. They are still producing champions today even after suffering the horrors of the Grenfell Tower where the old gym was based. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thanks also to England coach Jim Davison and his team for picking me &amp; giving me the chance to gain such great experiences and see the world whilst representing my country.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Next comes my professional career. Having turned professional at 20 years of age I want to thank some of the key people who I have worked with over the past 10 years who I believe have only ever put my best interests first. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My solicitor and good friend Neil Sibley who has taken care of me my entire career; he has always gone above and beyond in securing my best interests and has been an invaluable member of my team. I cannot thank him enough. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My strength and conditioning coaches - past and present- who have transformed me into an athlete; Pete Marcasino who I worked with for the James Degale fight, my good friends Dan Lawrence and Barry O'Connell who I worked with for both Froch fights and the Badou Jack fight, and Darryl Richards who I have worked with since joining the McGuigan gym.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mick Williamson who has got me through some bloody nights. He's never failed me and he's always been a person of great experience to have on my side. Kevin Lidlow who has taken care of all my medical needs since turning professional- and there has been a lot! He is one of nicest people I know and the most professional individual I've ever met. He was key in rehabilitating my knee before my first pro fight. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since then he has taken care of broken hands, broken ribs, a deviated septum, a dozen cuts, a broken jaw, a thousand aches and pains and a dislocated shoulder. A true genius who has extended my career time and time again. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also a thank you to Ben Carraway who I spent months of intense rehab with, working on bringing my shoulder back to fitness in an impossible timeframe. Without these two I wouldn't have made the WBSS final.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My media and business agents Duncan Ross, Dean Baker and everyone at Wasserman who have helped me build my public profile, managed my public appearances and negotiated my entry into the World Boxing Super Series. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They have generated money for me without having to get punched in the face and helped take care of the minute details on fight weeks that can be the difference between winning and losing. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To everyone at McGuigan's gym who were the difference between success and failure. In particular my coach Shane McGuigan who reinstalled my belief and guided me to my greatest night. Barry, Jake and Blain McGuigan who have helped in camp and on fight night, Josh Pritchard who works my corner on fight night and is Shane's right hand man. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also to Jimmy Tibbs who Shane has brought into my corner the last couple of years- it's been great to have his experience on hand too. Meeting Shane was the turning point in my career. He was the missing piece I needed to fulfil my full potential. Without him I don't know if I would have ever got there.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a trainer, Shane gave me the spark back, got me in the best shape of my life, and with his unwavering dedication helped me become the number one recognised fighter in the division. For this I am eternally grateful. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I will leave my fighting days with a friend for life in Shane. I want to thank some good friends who have played a part too. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Philip Sharkey, a boxing photographer I met at his Oxford Street studio 10 years ago. Tomasz Szewczyk and Davide Nicolosi, my security team who have been looking after me since before the Degale fight. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My long time sponsors Graham Granville and Adam Garland of Zircom, &amp; Darren Golden of Exigo. My friend David Simpson who has managed my website and press at the start of my career.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Natalie and Will at Noyo Food for taking care of my nutritional needs for the past few years. My fellow fighters who have become friends through regular sparring; Sergej Rozvadovskij, Miles Shinkwin and Chris Billam-Smith. I want to thank everyone in the sport; the TV companies and their staff who have shown my fights, the promoters I've worked with, the journalists who have covered me and travelled the world to do so. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course I need to thank the fans who have supported me, and ultimately paid my wages! To all of you who have bought tickets to my fights, bought the PPV's, bought the T-shirts, stopped me in the street to show support, or sent me kind emails and messages after both good and difficult times; thank you. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The support I have received over my career from people has always been amazing. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The biggest thanks has to go to my family. My wife Sophie who is my childhood sweet heart. She has been through every high and every low with me and her support and love has kept me going through the darkest of times. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My Mum and Dad, Yvonne and Donnie, who have always given me fantastic support from the very beginning and pushed me in everything I have ever done. They're my biggest fans &amp; I've always known how proud they are of me. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lastly a prayer for Eduard Gutknecht who suffered a brain aneurysm after our fight in November 2016. He was put into an induced coma for 3 weeks and bravely fought his way back to consciousness. He lives in Germany with his wife, 3 children and a full time carer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This fight brought home the realisation that boxing can have brutal consequences. After this, I truly felt like my fighting days were numbered. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After winning the WBA world title I decided to only continue fighting while it felt necessary. After the birth of my second son last year and losing in the final of WBSS, I knew the desire to fight had left me. Retiring at 30 was a suggestion I first heard 10 years ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I thought it was a good idea then and I still do now. However, boxing has been my life &amp; I would love to remain in the sport to some degree. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have my manager's licence that has enabled me to be self-managed for the past 5 years. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I'm delighted to be able to take this opportunity to announce I will be joining Wasserman as an adviser in their boxing division. They currently manage a host of fighters both here in the U.K and in the U.S, and although predominately known for football- being one of the largest football agencies in the world- they're starting to make waves in the boxing world too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I hope that by joining them, and with some hard work, we will become a prominent figure in the sport of boxing, delivering first rate services for fighters. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I believe I've got a lot of knowledge and experience in boxing- for situations both in and out of the ring- that could be invaluable to future champions of this sport.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I've had lots of incredible opportunities to work with almost everyone in the sport from a range of promoters and TV networks whilst being self-managed, which I believe has left me with a unique set of skills that could set me apart from other managers / advisors. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I'm really looking forward to this challenge. Working as a TV/Radio pundit is something I have enjoyed over the years and is also something I would love to pursue wherever possible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I will be involved in ITV's PBC show next month staging Eubank v Degale as a pundit which I'm sure will be fun. I am also planning to follow my new interest of motivational speaking. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I'm hoping that my story of never giving up may be able to inspire the odd person here and there. So once again I would like to say a massive thank you to everyone who has shown me love and support over the years. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In my darkest and hardest times, it has been other people's energy and enthusiasm that has kept me focused and determined to achieve my dreams. </p></div>                        </div>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>George Groves has retired from boxing following the loss of his world super-middleweight title to Liverpool's Callum Smith last September.

I don’t have to chase points. I can build my schedule around the majors.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rose began with a three-shot lead but it soon became clear this was going to be far from a stroll as he suffered three lip-outs in the first six holes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now his lead over Adam Scott and Jon Rahm was just a stroke, while Rory McIlroy, who had begun seven shots behind, was on the march and just three back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A test of character for Rose, therefore, and as so often one he passed with considerable aplomb. A much-needed first birdie of the day at the 7th was followed by two more at the 9th and 10th, and now he was four shots clear. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/27/23/9057862-6638353-image-a-45_1548631358979.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Justin Rose overcame some early wobbles to post a gutsy triumph in Farmers Insurance Open" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/27/23/9058116-6638353-image-a-53_1548631803131.jpg" height="471" width="634" alt="Rose became the first Englishman since Jim Barnes to make it into double digits for wins" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">On a tough course like Torrey Pines — the scene of Tiger Woods’s last major triumph, at the 2008 US Open — there’s little hope of catching a supreme shotmaker like Rose with so few holes to play.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rose put on a front-running clinic coming home to hold off Scott with a 69 for a 21 under par total and a first prize of $1.3 million. Scott, who hit birdies on the last four holes, carded a 68 to finish second on 19 under, while McIlroy joined Rahm and Australian Jason Day in tied fifth after a 69.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In his first event of the new season, Woods got something going with a back nine played in 31 shots for a 67 to move inside the top 20.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the European Tour, Bryson DeChambeau had insisted on Saturday he had still to find his A game, despite the fact he had grasped the lead going into the final round of the Omega Dubai Desert Classic.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/27/23/9058196-6638353-image-a-54_1548631930482.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Rose began with a three shot lead but it soon became clear this was not going to be  a stroll" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/27/23/9058952-6638353-image-a-66_1548633069505.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="Rose put on a front-running clinic coming home to hold off Scott with a 69 for a 21 under par" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">If that came across as just a touch of American baloney, the 25 year old from Modesto, California dispelled the notion emphatically yesterday with a round that was anything but modest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, no-one was left in any doubt as to what he had been driving at earlier, as he upped his game appreciably with an impressive final round 64 for a tournament record score of 24 under par and a runaway seven stroke success over England’s Matt Wallace. What a way to win your first tournament outside America, and first on the European Tour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I executed a lot of great shots, and it feels incredible to get my first win worldwide,’ he said. ‘I had an ambitious goal of 25 under in my head and I almost got there.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Two of the last three winners of this event have gone on to win the Masters at Augusta a couple of months later, and DeChambeau demonstrated he has got all the tools to follow in the footsteps of Danny Willett and Sergio Garcia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was his fourth win in his last eight starts on the PGA and European Tours, and the fifth in his last 15. Dismissed as a ‘mad scientist’ when he first emerged less than three years ago, with irons that all have the same length of shaft — the length of a seven iron — and golf balls that are tested in Epsom salts for balance, it is clear the physics major has unearthed a winning formula for geeks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘My recent results do feel like a vindication for doing it in a different way,’ said DeChambeau.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>Justin Rose overcame some early wobbles to post a gutsy two-shot triumph in the Farmers Insurance Open in California on Sunday night and cement his position as world No1.

He will not buy for buying sake, apparently. That's all very well and will no doubt please the accountants tasked with making up the shortfall from failure to build the club's new stadium on time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But as injuries have bitten during the recent weeks of Tottenham's season, the deep flaws in that policy have become clear. If you are to compete on two or three fronts at this time of year then you need bodies and after a summer of similar transfer inactivity, Tottenham do not have enough of them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After this, it is a dormant argument anyway. Now that defeat to Chelsea in the Carabao Cup semi-final has been followed by FA Cup disappointment in South London, a heavy work load is no longer Tottenham's problem.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All they have left is the Premier League and the Champions League and as such it looks as though yet another Pochettino season will end without a trophy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sooner or later, the Argentinean's CV is going to look lop-sided in the very worst way and if he is to move to Manchester United in the summer then he will do so having won not a single trophy in ten years as a manager.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, Palace very much deserved their win. Spurs enjoyed the weight of possession but Palace had the purpose and the will and the decisiveness in front of goal. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They were the team who looked as though a place in the next round was important to them and they had the individuals who stepped up to make the key contributions when it mattered.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wickham's goal in the ninth minute was a tap in but meant everything after so long out with knee trouble.

He has been eased back in to action slowly by his manager Roy Hodgson this season and only eight minutes had passed when Jeffrey Schlupp surged past Davinson Sanchez in to the penalty area and brought a low save from Paulo Gazzaniga, allowing Wickham to convert the rebound from a couple of yards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Few goals will come easier to the 25-year-old but equally few will ever mean more. His celebration spoke volumes from that point of view.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Given a platform by the goal, Palace built on it quickly as Tottenham faltered. Tottenham had some possession and territory but didn't create anything other than a long range shot from Lucas Moura and when visiting defender Kyle Walker-Peters inexplicably handled a high cross just after the half hour Andros Townsend drove the resulting penalty down the middle and placed Palace in control of the game.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Townsend should have scored again almost immediately. Set up by Patrick van Aanholt, he had the whole goal to aim at from 15 yards but struck his shot straight at the goalkeeper. That felt like a big moment and certainly would have been had Kieran Trippier not wasted a golden opportunity of his own right before half-time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Van Aanholt's penalty area challenge on Tottenham's Juan Foyth was rash but Trippier's subsequent kick was just dreadful, missing Speroni's right hand post by at least a foot.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prior to that Speroni had made a stunning double save from Georges-Kevin N'koudou after Tottenham had worked a clever free-kick on the edge of the penalty area. Early in the second half, meanwhile, the 39-year-old denied Fernando Llorente when the Spaniard had turned smartly in the area to drive a shot low towards the centre of the goal. </p><video preload="none" id="1850148" title="Pochettino laments schedule after 2-0 FA Cup loss against Palace" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/27/19/video-9052202-86_636x358.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/01/27/2448557290777982821/1024x576_MP4_2448557290777982821.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/27/16/9047830-6637503-image-a-6_1548605713806.jpg" height="640" width="962" alt="Wickham was mobbed by his team-mates after putting Palace ahead and getting back among the goals for his side" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/27/16/9047822-6637503-image-a-8_1548605716540.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Wickham hit the back of the net on his first start in 792 days after suffering a serious injury which kept him sidelined " /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/27/16/9047824-6637503-image-a-10_1548605720624.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Wickham acknowledged the support from the home faithful, who roared his name following his early strike" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/27/16/9048210-6637503-image-a-11_1548606759502.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Wilfried Zaha was involved in the action from the off, and look to quickly kick-start attacks on the Spurs defensive line" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/27/16/9048212-6637503-image-a-14_1548606764030.jpg" height="640" width="962" alt="N'Koudou was given a rare start for Spurs, after recently impressing when coming on as a substitute in the Premier League" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"> They were important saves because as poorly as Tottenham were playing they would surely have fed off the momentum of a goal. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In his programme notes, chairman Steve Parish had written about Speroni, asking supporters specifically to forgive him the previous weekend's mistake at Anfield.

Connor Wickham finally put two years of injury troubles behind him to score his first goal since November 2016. Meanwhile, goalkeeper Julian Speroni buried the memories of last weekend’s nightmare at Anfield with three saves that helped his team over the line at Selhurst Park. For Tottenham, meanwhile, the failure was wholly collective. Shorn of injured players such as Harry Kane and Dele Alli and with others left on the bench in the name of rotation, Maurico Pochettino’s team underlined much of what we already know, namely that the Tottenham squad is not deep enough.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ian Ladyman for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-27T20:36:02.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Crystal Palace 2-0 Tottenham: Wickham scores on long-awaited return</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-27T20:36:02.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>FA Cup,Tottenham Hotspur,Crystal Palace</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/27/18/9050990-0-image-a-3_1548614086413.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sportsnews/article-6636935/Search-Emiliano-Sala-set-RESUME-260-000-gofundme-target-reached.html" title="Search for Emiliano Sala is set to RESUME after £260,000 gofundme target is reached following generous donations from football stars around the world including Kylian Mbappe, Adrien Rabiot and Laurent Koscielny"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6635969/Chokers-lacking-ambition-No-Tottenham-admirable-club-rest-want-emulate.html" title="Chokers lacking ambition?

'I get annoyed when people go on about Spurs needing to win something.

He'd say: "Winning isn't everything, wanting to win is".'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was a typical flash of Blanchflower wit before the FA Cup final in 1961 as he presented his team to the Duchess of Kent. When she asked why they didn't have names on their backs like Leicester, he replied: 'Well, Ma'am, you see we all know each other.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was a thinker and an innovator.

Taking a throw-in, if he held the ball in his right hand before he threw it he was going to throw it that side of the player he was throwing to.

In a World Cup qualifier against Portugal in May 1957, he tapped it short to Jimmy McIlroy, who scored, although a bewildered referee ordered the kick to be retaken.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I remember going on holiday with the McIlroys to Devon,' says Richard, but at Wembley in 1962 they were rivals with McIlroy in the Burnley team and Blanchflower scoring Tottenham's third with a penalty in a 3-1 win.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Greaves struck first and Jimmy Robson leveled before Smith fired Spurs ahead, becoming the first to find the net in successive FA Cup finals, a feat unmatched until Arsenal's Freddie Ljungberg in 2002.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I went with my nan and grandad and we sat near the Royal Box,' says Steve. 'I remember craning my neck to see the Queen. I remember the penalty and my dad scoring. Back to goal, turned and hit it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He was a prolific scorer, a strong and bustling centre forward from the days when they used to shoulder-charge goalkeepers over the line.

Lovell left home at 16, signed for Palace and so began an extraordinary journey which returns to its source on Saturday as the Gills face Swansea in the FA Cup.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Along the way, there were two FA Youth Cup victories and a role in Palace's 'Team of the 80s' under Terry Venables.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/19/8994424-6633357-image-a-29_1548445343127.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="But after Peter Taylor departed Priestfield, the chairman rang Lovell and he landed the job" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were four years with George Graham at Millwall where Lovell converted from full-back to striker and reached the FA Cup quarter-finals, a run which ended on the night of the notorious riot at Luton's Kenilworth Road.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were six caps for Wales, six games on loan for Swansea under Terry Yorath and Wembley glory at the age of 40, playing up front for 45 minutes as Deal Town won the FA Vase.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there were four separate spells at Gillingham and a long quest for the manager's role which he finally claimed in October 2017.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It took me 25 years to get the job I wanted,' says Lovell. 'I remember going for it in 1992, when I was still playing, and got to the final interview when it was between me and Glenn Roeder, and Glenn got the job.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So, the first player to be booted out was me.

Only three players have more, but off he went into non-league football until 2000, when he returned to join the club's community scheme.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I did everything,' says Lovell. 'Coaching in the freezing cold in a field in the middle of nowhere, running the girls' teams, wheelchair football, disabled football, soccer schools, education work.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Our coaches went into schools to assist the kids with their writing.

'I wanted to manage. I wanted to test myself. I knew I could do it. The chairman knew how I felt but he'd never asked me before.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When Aidy left and Peter took over I thought that was it. I was in the car with my wife, saying I thought my chance had gone and I'd see how it went until the end of the season and then look for something else.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I parked in the drive, got out the car and the phone rang and it was the chairman. He said: "Peter's left and you're in charge".'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gillingham were deep in trouble with only seven points from 12 games in League One, but Lovell won his first game at Peterborough and kept them up with points to spare.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/19/8994388-6633357-image-m-40_1548445415711.jpg" height="421" width="306" alt="Gillingham struggled when Lovell took charge but he won his first game and kept them up" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/19/8994384-6633357-image-a-41_1548445422410.jpg" height="421" width="306" alt="He has a wealth of experience from a career both as a player and as a coach" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/19/8994382-6633357-image-a-42_1548445428675.jpg" height="434" width="634" alt="Having already sent a higher team tumbling this year in the FA Cup, Lovell has his eyes on more" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Walking back from the dug-out when the final whistle went at Peterborough was the best walk I'd ever done in football,' he says.

Maybe it was meant to be.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It promises to be another emotional day for Lovell at the Liberty Stadium. Having stunned Premier League Cardiff in the last round, with a late goal by Elliot List, he did not hesitate to name Swansea away when asked who he wanted next.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lovell played rugby at school but was reared on stories from the Vetch Field, where his father, Alan, had been a young professional, training and playing with Ivor Allchurch, Cliff Jones and Mel Charles before combining an amateur playing career with 30 years in the Ford factory.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/22/8998924-6633357-image-a-71_1548453904837.jpg" height="445" width="634" alt="Gillingham got the taste for giant-killings in the previous round when they beat Cardiff City" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/22/8998928-6633357-image-a-69_1548453898633.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="They will be backed in good numbers away at Swansea where the club's fans will dream again" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He was only in the reserves but I've seen pictures of them playing in front of 30,000,' says Lovell. 'He went on and played for Poole Town and scored a lot of goals in semi-pro. He was a little No 10, quick and good in the air.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When I was really young, I was more into books than sport, so my Dad took me down the Vetch to get me interested and he'd take me to the local field on a Sunday morning, just one-v-one and he'd coach me, and he started a boys team with his friend called Dunvant and Three Crosses.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He loved his football. He was a season-ticket holder at the Liberty.

He was still basking in the audacity of the transfer coup, having beaten Manchester City to his signature.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sanchez pocketed a £6.75million signing-on fee and an annual salary of £20.35m plus bonuses at Old Trafford, was handed the fabled No 7 and plonked before a piano for a cheesy unveiling video. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/22/8999546-6633811-image-a-4_1548455057998.jpg" height="401" width="634" alt="Chilean Sanchez dinked the ball over goalkeeper Petr Cech to open the scoring in the Cup tie" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">None of which was well received at Arsenal, where they once hung a banner in honour of Sanchez and his pet dogs Atom and Humber.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They longed to keep a player who scored 80 goals in 166 games over three-and-a-half years and distracted from deeper problems, and someone thought the dog banner might appeal to his sense of loyalty, which was almost as laughable as the piano stunt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So they jeered his name when the teams were announced last night and they booed his early touches as he struggled to get into the game, playing on United's left flank where he was up against Ainsley Maitland-Niles, inexperienced and out of position.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They cheered when Maitland-Niles cut out his crosses and miscued an attempted clearance - but they fell silent when he beat Cech and finished coolly from a tight angle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was his first Manchester United goal away from Old Trafford.

Unai Emery has virtually given up on Ozil who was unable to rescue this tie from the bench and is available on loan with Arsenal prepared to subsidise his enormous wages.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Matt Barlow for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-25T23:50:38.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Alexis Sanchez picks his moment after year to forget at Man United</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-25T23:50:38.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Alexis Sanchez,Arsenal,FA Cup,Manchester United</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/22/8999560-0-image-a-16_1548455185748.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1219887</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Man Utd via Getty Images</mi:licensorName></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6633187/Arsenal-1-3-Manchester-United-Sanchez-Lingard-Martial-fire-visitors-FA-Cup-fifth-round.html" title="Arsenal 1-3 Manchester United: Eight in a row for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as Alexis Sanchez, Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial fire them to FA Cup fifth round"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6633715/Arsenal-1-3-Man-Utd-RATINGS-Lukaku-impressive-Cech-disappointing.html" title="PLAYER RATINGS: Romelu Lukaku enjoyed a pleasing night with two assists, but soon-to-be-retired Petr Cech endured a disappointing game"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6633791/FA-Cup-defeat-Manchester-United-force-Arsenal-market-defender.html" title="FA Cup defeat to Manchester United may force Arsenal into the transfer market for a defender"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6633591/Leonardo-Jardim-reappointed-Monaco-three-months-sacked.html" title="Leonardo Jardim reappointed by Monaco three months after he was sacked and replaced by Thierry Henry"></atom:link></item><item><title>Arsenal 1-3 Manchester United: Eight in a row for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as Alexis Sanchez, Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial fire them to FA Cup fifth round</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6633187/Arsenal-1-3-Manchester-United-Sanchez-Lingard-Martial-fire-visitors-FA-Cup-fifth-round.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jan 2019 21:54:42 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6633187</guid><description><![CDATA[MARTIN SAMUEL AT THE EMIRATES: Sometimes the stars align for a man, and it is starting to feel that way for Solskjaer.

Solskjaer is making it look easy, and his appointment increasingly irresistible the longer than run continues.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Seriously, what more can he do? There comes a point when the narrative is no longer about simply cheering the place up; when these results demand to be taken seriously as a body of work suggesting serious credentials for the job. A run of eight wins on the trot – and Burnley at home is the next match, so probably nine – might just be it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">True, it is not a bad plan B, Lukaku and Sanchez – Solskjaer’s second string forward selection exposing the myth of Manchester United’s weak squad. On the bench and given a well-earned rest, Rashford and Martial. With the possible exception of Manchester City, no other club has that level of strength in reserve, and City certainly don’t have it in their central forward line.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet it isn’t just the players at Solskjaer’s disposal, but the way he deploys them that has transformed Manchester United. As he did against Tottenham, Solskjaer sent his forwards wide and used Jesse Lingard as a false nine, arriving from deep.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It worked perfectly, too. Lukaku was quite brilliant on the right, creating both goals with a talent for invention few imagine he possesses; Sanchez and Lingard scored within two minutes of each other, the goals sweetly taken and full of confidence, Solskjaer’s strategy vindicated in the way his team simply took the tie away from Arsenal. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/20/8996050-6633187-image-a-13_1548449651886.jpg" height="640" width="962" alt="Paul Pogba has looked revitalised under Solskjaer and he was kept under close observation by the Arsenal midfield on Friday" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/20/8996038-6633187-image-a-14_1548449660737.jpg" height="625" width="962" alt="Challenges were flying in from both sides as Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette attempts to halt Nemanja Matic going clear" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/20/8996524-6633187-image-a-24_1548449954771.jpg" height="724" width="962" alt="The home side were given an early injury blow when centre back Sokratis Papastathopoulos landed awkwardly from a header" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/20/8996522-6633187-image-a-27_1548449958705.jpg" height="740" width="962" alt="The defender was visibly frustrated to see his evening cut short as he was helped off the pitch by one of the medical team" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Emery’s team had a lot of possession early without threatening, although Alex Iwobi should have done more with a 24th minute shot put straight at goalkeeper Sergio Romero. A pass to the better positioned Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang would have been the wiser choice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The loss of defender Soktaris, however, seemed to unsettle them. He landed awkwardly having jumped with Lingard, tried to carry on, but could not. With the movement of United’s front line, there is no way Arsenal could have got away with anything less than a fully fit defensive four. Shkodran Mustafi came on but, soon, United were two up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The threat had been signalled previously when a one-two between Paul Pogba and Sanchez brought United’s first chance after 11 minutes. Petr Cech, playing what will be his final FA Cup game having announced his retirement at the end of the season, came swiftly from his line and smothered the ball at Sanchez’s feet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">United always looked the likelier to score however, and in the 31st minute they did, and in the worst way possible from the local perspective. Arsenal’s fans had been singling Sanchez out for treatment all game, so it must have been delightful to see him skip around Cech to score United’s first – and in a way that underlined the player they have lost, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sanchez got the goal – but what an assist from Lukaku. There is of course more to him than the force he displays when used conventionally as a number nine, but this was exquisite by any standard. If Eden Hazard or Mesut Ozil had played such a pass we would be talking about it for weeks. Yes: that good.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was on the reverse, from the edge of the penalty area, eye of the needle, taking two Arsenal defenders out of the game, and leaving Sanchez free, with only Cech to beat. He rounded the goalkeeper but was left with a tight angle from the right. Could he make it? With ease. Pogba was following in, just in case, but wasn’t needed. This was a peak Sanchez finish, a reminder of the days when he was the best of it here. Arsenal were rocked, and were soon two behind. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/20/8996460-6633187-image-a-29_1548449961992.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Emery was his usual animated self on the touchline as he tried to coax more energy from his side after the injury blow" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/22/8996478-6633187-Arsenal_started_brighter_and_caused_a_number_of_issues_for_Unite-m-77_1548455114843.jpg" height="618" width="962" alt="Arsenal started brighter and caused a number of issues for United in wide areas through Bosnian wing-back Sead Kolasinac" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/20/8996538-6633187-image-a-32_1548449975593.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="But a failure to make dominance count proved costly when Sanchez came back to haunt his former side to score for 1-0 " /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/20/8996462-6633187-image-a-35_1548449982503.jpg" height="698" width="962" alt="Solskjaer was delighted to see his side open the scoring but continued to demand his player stick to their detailed game-plan" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox sport" data-version="2" id="mol-928d3520-20e8-11e9-b734-bdb09404b277">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">MATCH FACTS, PLAYER RATINGS AND MATCH ZONE</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><div class="cleared row mol-cols mol-cols-2" id="mol-928df870-20e8-11e9-b734-bdb09404b277">                            <div class="mol-col span6 mol-col-1" style="style">                                <div class="cleared mol-col-content"><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font color="#000000"><strong>Arsenal (4-3-3)</strong>: <span class="class">Cech;  Maitland-Niles, Sokratis (Mustafi 21), Koscielny (Guendouzi 64), Kolasinac; Torreira, Xhaka; Iwobi (Ozil 64), Ramsey, Aubameyang; Lacazette</span></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Subs not used:</strong> Leno, Monreal, Lichtsteiner, Elneny</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Goal</strong>: Aubameyang 43 </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Booked: </strong><span class="class">Koscielny, Kolasinac, Guendouzi</span><strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Manager:</strong> Unai Emery</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Manchester United (4-3-3): </strong><span class="class">Romero; Young, Lindelof, Bailly, Shaw; Herrera, Matic, Pogba; Lukaku (Rashford 72), Lingard (Jones 88), Sanchez (Martial 72)</span><strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Subs not used:</strong> Grant, Mata, Dalot, Fred</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Goals</strong>: Sanchez 31, Lingard 33, Martial 82 </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Booked: </strong><span class="class">Lingard, Rashford</span><strong></strong><strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Manager:</strong> Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Referee:</strong> Craig Pawson<strong> </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MOM: </strong><span class="class">Romelu Lukaku</span><strong></strong></p>                                </div>                            </div><div class="mol-col span6 mol-col-2" style="style">                                <div class="cleared mol-col-content">                                    <img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/20/8996058-6633187-image-m-2_1548448778073.jpg" height="390" width="453" alt="" />                                </div>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was more of the lackadaisical Arsenal that has proved so frustrating in recent years, Luke Shaw allowed to carry the ball a significant distance through midfield, before setting Lukaku away down the right. His cut back was inch perfect, and expertly finished by Lingard. United’s bench rejoiced; Arsenal looked done.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet, having played much of the first-half as if engaged in a Community Shield game, the second goal sparked life in the home side and two minutes before half-time they were back in it. Iwobi played the ball in to Aaron Ramsey – Arsenal’s best player, and each time that is written, his move to Juventus seems more ludicrous – whose cross got the merest touch from Alexandre Lacazette.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He couldn’t divert it into the goal, but did keep it out of Manchester United’s clutches, finding Aubameyang at the far post for the simplest conversion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They could have equalised, too, had Romero not made a fine fingertip save from a header by Ramsey a minute after half-time. Bad luck seems to follow certain Arsenal players around though and, Hector Bellerin having returned from injury only to be lost for the season against Chelsea, Laurent Koscielny received a nasty, wholly accidental, kick to the head from Lukaku. No blood, but lots of treatment, suggesting structural rather than superficial damage, maybe a broken jaw. Ouch. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/21/8996912-6633187-image-a-36_1548450380706.jpg" height="624" width="962" alt="United's determination to hurt Arsenal when they looked to be at their most vulnerable paid off when Lingard got his goal" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/21/8996906-6633187-image-a-38_1548450391244.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="The charismatic midfielder raised his arm towards the travelling supporters as the home crowd were stunned to be 2-0 down" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/21/8996988-6633187-image-a-40_1548450530504.jpg" height="570" width="962" alt="Lucas Torreira grabs the ball and Aaron Ramsey celebrated after reducing the deficit and Arsenal improved in the second half" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/21/8997274-6633187-image-a-49_1548451732614.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="The hosts were almost level immediately after the restart as Ramsey, Arsenal's best player, seeing his header tipped over" /><video preload="none" id="1849538" title="Solskjaer after Manchester United&amp;#39;s 3-1 win over Arsenal" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/26/02/video-9005526-95_636x358.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/01/26/4285610062496022591/1024x576_MP4_4285610062496022591.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><p class="mol-para-with-font">With Granit Xhaka a battlefield promotion to centre-half, Solskjaer seized his chance to put the outcome beyond doubt. On came fresh legs, Rashford And Martial, and in the 82nd minute it was over. Pogba surged through central midfield on a long, powerful run, forcing a save from Cech, before Martial was first to the rebound for the third.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Emirates began to empty and Manchester United started to conserve energy and minimise risk. When Sead Kolasinac clashed with Rashford, leaning his head in – both were booked – and Lingard got involved, the mood turned nasty.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was a melee and Lingard appeared to be further angered by the reaction of the crowd – either something thrown, or something said – and had to be held back by a steward. Having already been booked, had referee Craig Pawson spotted his reaction, he could have been cautioned a second time. Minutes later, Solskljaer sensibly took him off, his final change of the night. Everything he does right now is shot through with common sense; as well as celestial blessing. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/21/8997280-6633187-image-a-43_1548451171843.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Arsenal soon founnd themselves rocked again as they lost a second centre back to injury when Laurent Koscileny went down" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/21/8997580-6633187-image-a-46_1548451727087.jpg" height="813" width="962" alt="Koscielny was devastated to be forced off the pitch with injury and after losing two defenders, Emery was forced to improvise" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/21/8997574-6633187-image-a-51_1548451746124.jpg" height="702" width="962" alt="He made a double change which included Mesut Ozil, who has found game-time hard to come by since Emery's arrival as boss" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/21/8998064-6633187-image-a-55_1548452518007.jpg" height="642" width="962" alt="Arsenal's decision to throw caution to the wind came at a price as Martial came off the bench to ensure United won the tie" /><video preload="none" id="1849540" title="Emery after Arsenal&amp;#39;s 3-1 defeat to Manchester United" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/26/02/video-9005530-993_636x358.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/01/26/4387975173353879352/1024x576_MP4_4387975173353879352.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>MARTIN SAMUEL AT THE EMIRATES STADIUM: Sometimes the stars align for a man, and it is starting to feel that way for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.

The WBC have mandated the return bout and will call for purse bids if no agreement is reached between the camps by February 5.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Jeff Powell For Mailonline</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-25T22:02:12.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Warren: Joshua is heading from Park Lane to Brick Lane under Hearn</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-25T22:02:12.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Deontay Wilder,Tyson Fury,Anthony Joshua</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/00/8961134-0-image-a-11_1548377459866.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1208279</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Getty Images</mi:licensorName></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-6628341/Joshua-skips-gym-chowing-coconut-salmon-meal.html" title="Lunch of champions: Anthony Joshua skips to it in the gym before chowing down on coconut and salmon meal"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-6628105/Deontay-Wilders-brother-Marsellos-fight-DeGale-Eubank-undercard.html" title="Deontay Wilder's brother Marsellos to fight on the undercard of James DeGale vs Chris Eubank Jnr... and WBC champion will be with him in London!"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-6627515/Lewis-calls-Joshua-join-three-way-battle-Fury-Wilder.html" title="'I'm looking forward to the emergence of one undisputed champion': Lennox Lewis calls for Anthony Joshua to join three-way battle with Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder for heavyweight titles"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-6623961/Joe-Joyce-face-Bermane-Stiverne-O2.html" title="Joe Joyce to face Bermane Stiverne on undercard of James DeGale v Chris Eubank Jr at the O2"></atom:link></item><item><title>Jose Mourinho seems to enjoy life as a television pundit... but ex-Manchester United boss looks to be edging closer to Real Madrid reunion </title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6630295/Mourinho-enjoy-life-pundit-ex-Man-United-boss-looks-edging-closer-Madrid.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jan 2019 00:34:09 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6630295</guid><description><![CDATA[JEFF POWELL: Jose Mourinho seems to be enjoying himself as a broadcast commentator but his spells at the microphone look more and more like pit stops on his way back to Real Madrid.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="mol-para-with-font"> <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/jose_mourinho/index.html" id="mol-edb106d0-2038-11e9-9670-419104cbca10">Jose Mourinho</a> seems to be enjoying himself as a broadcast commentator but his spells at the microphone look more and more like pit stops on his way back to <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/teampages/real-madrid.html" id="mol-edafce50-2038-11e9-9670-419104cbca10">Real Madrid</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That rumour mill started grinding the minute after he was shown the door at Old Trafford.

Scholes became convinced that was the agenda when Mourinho picked a fight with Antonio Valencia, who he describes as 'the nicest man in the world with whom it is impossible to fall out.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Neville had previously criticised the United board for not backing Mourinho in the transfer market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But whoever was most to blame when the blow came - if blow it really was - it was cushioned by the £15million reportedly due to Mourinho by virtue of signing a contract extension last year.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/00/8960642-6630295-image-a-40_1548376024848.jpg" height="425" width="634" alt="Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has come in and changed both the results and the side's performances" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any embarrassment was short-lived, fading as it has amidst speculation that Real see Mourinho as their saviour come the end of a season which was already crumbling into the Spanish dust beneath Barcelona's feet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe Scholes, Neville and myself are wrong but on the side of the tracks we come from there is a phrase for it: Working your ticket.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Events under emergency manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer - not just the succession of victories but the restoration of United's style - have done nothing to dispel the impression that Mourinho had been functioning well below his best.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However could a manager as talented and dynamic not galvanise a similar response from players of such quality? Perhaps this is just the way he is. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mourinho has always been at his most special as an impact manager, his most effective in the first two seasons at a new club before all the drama wears thin in the dressing room.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/25/00/8953432-6630295-image-a-41_1548376031191.jpg" height="377" width="634" alt="United have won seven from seven since the Norwegian took over from Mourinho in December" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tellingly, even at Porto where he began accumulating his large collection of national and European trophies, he has always moved on within three years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That has applied not only at United and Chelsea, as well as in Portugal and Italy, but in a first spell at Real. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hence, down at the Bernabeu, they are fully aware that a sudden burst of Mourinho might kick them back on track... even if he does then fall victim yet again to third-season syndrome.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The stage is being set with Real trailing Barca by 10 points in La Liga. Even if they hold on to their European crown, which looks most unlikely with Cristiano Ronaldo gone to Juventus, embattled president Florentino Perez is expected to reinstate the Special One at the end of the season.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Who knows?

They were the third biggest spenders in the Premier League and, in 2018, the 13th biggest spenders in Europe, ahead of Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and all of Serie A, bar Juventus and Roma.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their reward, so far, is 19th place and, this week, a fracas at the training ground which saw striker Aboubakar Kamara arrested on suspicion of actual bodily harm and causing criminal damage. He had arrived in an attempt to sort out his future but instead sorted out a club security guard, inadvertently achieving his initial aim.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kamara joined in 2017, by which time Fulham’s RITA system was very much in place. Indeed, he is a typical RITA signing. Kamara started at Monaco, didn’t make it and had an unmemorable year with Kortrijk in the Belgian league before signing for Amiens, a small club in France’s Ligue 1.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/11/8890878-6627095-Fulham_boss_Claudio_Ranieri_banished_Kamara_from_training_for_be-a-51_1548329756748.jpg" height="417" width="632" alt="This year, Kamara’s flaws have been increasingly evident. He ignored his former, Claudio Ranieri, and his team-mates to take a penalty ahead of Aleksandar Mitrovic — which he missed" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">After a single reasonable season, Fulham bought him for a fee in the region of £5.3m.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No doubt his numbers were excellent. Yet there is one aspect of a player’s performance RITA cannot accurately espy: character. The warning signs were there in Kamara’s first season in the Championship when he scored seven goals but drew more cards — seven yellow, one red.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This year, Kamara’s flaws have been increasingly evident. He ignored his manager, Claudio Ranieri, and his team-mates to take a penalty ahead of Aleksandar Mitrovic — which he then missed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He argued with Mitrovic again during a yoga session, for which he was dropped from the team and skipped training having been banished to work with the under-23 squad. Then, when he attempted to confront chief executive officer Alistair Mackintosh, a fight broke out at the training ground.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It appears Kamara, like Shorty, has something that cannot be found in books, or located via an analytics programme: he’s a high-maintenance pest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also not showing up on computer screens were language skills, which is how Fulham came to sign two goalkeepers, Fabricio Agosto Ramirez and Sergio Rico, who barely spoke English.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/10/8887110-6627095-Fulham_striker_Aboubakar_Kamara_left_pictured_with_Aleksandar_Mi-a-28_1548327104182.jpg" height="455" width="632" alt="He argued with Mitrovic again during a yoga session, for which he was dropped from the team" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fabri, in particular, struggled immensely and could not understand his defenders or make himself understood.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He started the first two games of the season, let in five goals and has not been seen since, not even chanced in Carabao Cup matches with Exeter and Millwall or in the FA Cup with Oldham.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fabri was a title winner with Besiktas but also the player who started to cry after letting in four first-half goals for the club, on the way to losing 6-0 against Dynamo Kiev in the Champions League.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘His scouting profile and data profile are both strong,’ Fulham confirmed when Fabri arrived for a ball-park £5m.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Obviously, recruitment cannot just operate off a series of hunches. Analytics are a vital part, as are scouting and first-hand knowledge. One of Fabri’s previous clubs was Deportivo La Coruna, where he worked with Fulham’s goalkeeping coach Jose Sambade Carreira.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is possible the same mistake could have been made by going the old-fashioned route of scouting research and recommendation. Yet Fulham’s analytics department also rejected Glenn Murray, before he went to Brighton and Callum Wilson — now valued at £50m by Bournemouth — because their numbers did not add up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The same numbers that cannot identify a suspect temperament, or a weakness of character, or incompatibility with team-mates, facets that are no less important.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 1984, when Terry Venables considered taking Steve Archibald to Barcelona, he asked around.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/19/8949558-6629271-image-m-7_1548358146897.jpg" height="486" width="634" alt="The warning signs were there in Kamara’s first season in the Championship" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Venables liked Archibald as a player, but didn’t know him. He made discreet enquiries. What was he like? Quiet, everyone said, bit of a loner, doesn’t really mix with the lads. At an English club that might have been a drawback — but Venables wanted him in Spain. A solitary man might as well be alone in Barcelona, as London, he reasoned. All the problems that might affect a British player abroad — language, being outside the group, inability to socialise — wouldn’t matter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Venables signed Archibald, who was a great success, and they won Barcelona’s first league title in 11 years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The need for character cannot be underestimated. It is what Maurizio Sarri is alluding to in his comments about Eden Hazard.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He plainly admires Hazard’s abilities as a player but does not see him possessing the mentality to be a leader, as he should be at Chelsea.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Wonderful, but an individual player,’ was his description. ‘He’s more an individual than a leader.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sarri hasn’t had everything right this season but he makes a point here. If one aspect of Hazard’s make-up stops him being the best in the world it is his character.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He disappears for weeks, sometimes entire seasons, if circumstances are not to his liking, in a way Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi never do. He can turn matches in a minute, as Sarri identifies, but can also turn off — and while there will be a clue with a dip in his numbers, these alone can never tell the whole story.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Miss Lucy got it, Fulham didn’t. That’s the problem with analytics.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><strong>Oldham must give Paul Scholes time</strong> </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Oldham cannot continue in an endless cycle of sacking managers. This inconsistency of strategy and ideas left them mired in the third tier for decades until finally the club dropped into League Two, where they remain, in 12th place. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once again, Oldham are trying to persuade Paul Scholes to take over, forcing him to drop his interest as part-owner of Salford City. Would it be the best move for Scholes? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would certainly be a good one for Oldham. Having a fan and household name in charge might at last persuade the owners to give a manager a chance to build. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They couldn’t adopt the same short-termism with Scholes. Could they?</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/19/8949710-6629271-image-m-17_1548358348081.jpg" height="498" width="634" alt="League Two outfit Oldham are trying to persuade Paul Scholes to take over as manager" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><strong>We've seen this before, Arsenal</strong></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was a fine victory for Arsenal over Chelsea last Saturday and much deserved. From the first minute they looked the better side and their midfield was exceptional: diligent, ferocious, swarming around Chelsea and disrupting their rhythm. But what does it mean?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We have seen this before from Arsenal under Unai Emery and previously with Arsene Wenger: a performance of supposed significance, seized upon yet ultimately empty.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On December 2, Arsenal defeated Tottenham 4-2 then drew 2-2 at Manchester United. Yet, by the end of the same month, they had lost at Southampton and conceded five at Liverpool. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was the same last season. Arsenal defeated Tottenham 2-0 on November 18, 2017, a result that delivered much crowing and triumphant dressing-room selfies but was soon followed by a 3-1 home defeat by Manchester United and draws with West Ham and Southampton.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/19/8949708-6629271-image-m-10_1548358305388.jpg" height="735" width="634" alt="It was a fine victory for Unai Emery's Arsenal over Chelsea last Saturday and much deserved" /><video preload="none" id="1848392" title="FA Cup match preview: Arsenal F.C.v Manchester United F.C." poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/13/video-8935362-646_636x358.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/01/24/7681939880708061390/1024x576_MP4_7681939880708061390.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><p class="mol-para-with-font">So Friday’s FA Cup fourth round tie is important. Arsenal are an elite club and are certainly capable of performing like one. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clearly, they are an elite club poorly served by their owner Stan Kroenke, whose limited ambition and vision was for many years hidden by Wenger’s generosity in accepting responsibility for failings that were not always his. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Emery’s announcement that he could only recruit loan players in January suggests Kroenke is no longer protected by his manager. Nonetheless, a team capable of sweeping Chelsea aside as comprehensively as Arsenal did at the weekend should also be taking the game to Manchester United, even reborn under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the Chelsea win to be more than just another false dawn, inflicting Solskjaer’s first defeat would be a sign of genuine change.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><strong>Cardiff can't change rules despite tragedy</strong> </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">As awful as it may be to deal with the tragic loss of Emiliano Sala, there is no way Cardiff can feasibly be granted an additional period to the January transfer window for the signing of players. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chief executive officer Ken Choo said the possibility of an extension had been discussed with the league but was rejected. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That may sound cold but any addition to Cardiff’s squad must come from somewhere and with all British and most European clubs closing for business at the end of this month, it cannot be that one is allowed to operate while others are not.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cardiff would have to be told they could not deal with any club bound by January transfer window dates, but even if they went outside Europe it could cause problems. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Say Neil Warnock looked to the league in China, where the window closes on February 28. The Chinese club could use Cardiff’s money to mount a raid on a Premier League rival, at a time when the player could not be replaced. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some may think the Premier League are being heartless here but, despite this terrible accident, they have done the right thing.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/19/8949704-6629271-image-m-12_1548358317688.jpg" height="572" width="634" alt="As awful as it may be to deal with the tragic loss of Emiliano Sala, there is no way Cardiff can feasibly be granted an additional period to the January transfer window " /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed apologised for a racist insult aimed at South Africa’s Andile Phehlukwayo that was picked up by a stump microphone during this week’s one-day international. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I didn’t mean for my words to be heard,’ said Sarfraz, but that’s not true.

Collins did not appear feisty in response, but brattish, at one time contemptuously dropping a towel on the court as she returned to her baseline position, left for a ball kid to scuttle across and pick up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That type of behaviour, rudeness towards the sport’s youngest helpers, should merit a code violation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ultimately, Collins’s actions rebounded. The more she moaned, the worse her tennis got and she lost the second set 6-0. Collins was the great underdog story of the women’s championship at the Australian Open but by the end few would have been sad to see her go.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/19/8949706-6629271-image-m-18_1548358363001.jpg" height="538" width="634" alt="Danielle Collins repeatedly argued with umpire Carlos Ramos during defeat by Petra Kvitova " /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"></h2><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><strong>Steve Bruce is on a sticky wicket in Barbados</strong></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">With Sheffield Wednesday preparing for the biggest match of their season against Chelsea on Sunday, how wrong does it look that Steve Bruce can be found taking in England’s Test match against West Indies in Barbados?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bruce was appointed on January 2 but, because of holiday commitments will not take over until February 1. In that period he has missed two league games and three FA Cup ties, including replays. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bruce wasn’t to know that Chelsea would be the FA Cup opposition but, even so, to see him palling around with the England players while his team prepare to face Eden Hazard and Gonzalo Higuain isn’t right. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It belittles Sheffield Wednesday, a club that still pulls an average of 23,763, despite sitting in 16th place in the Championship. Bruce lost both parents in 2018 and deserves his break.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After such a year, he has every right to feel that family is more important than football.

Tottenham were so depleted by injuries, they really couldn’t afford any additional rotten luck. And Dier, losing his nerve at a vital moment, was surely that. Chelsea were clear favourites even trailing 1-0 from the first leg. This was the man whose psychological profile supposedly made him the calmest penalty taker in the England squad. The visiting fans would have seen him as their banker.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, once Tottenham had fought back from 2-0 down at half-time to take this tie to the lottery of penalties, they must have felt cockily confident.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There had been an eerie silence around Stamford Bridge at the thought of such a random conclusion. Imagine being eliminated by a Tottenham side shorn of Harry Kane, Dele Alli and Son Heung-min. Imagine getting into a winning position, at home, and being unable to close it out. Oh, the humiliation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But as Dier returned, slowly, to the consoling embrace of his team-mates, suddenly the place was buzzing. Spurs had blinked first.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now Chelsea could be the screw-turners. And turn they did. Jorginho got cheeky, sending goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga the wrong way and rolling it into the opposite corner, but gently. Then Lucas Moura struck one at an inviting height to goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. Saved. Leading 3-2, now it was down to David Luiz. Score and it was over. Score and there was nothing Tottenham could do.  </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/22/8956458-6629265-image-a-13_1548369721649.jpg" height="380" width="962" alt="" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/20/8952502-6629265-image-a-82_1548363590166.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Tottenham striker Fernando Llorente (second left) scores their goal past Arrizabalaga to level the tie on aggregate" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/20/8952504-6629265-image-a-84_1548363592940.jpg" height="639" width="962" alt="Llorente runs to celebrate after bringing the score level on aggregate within five minutes of the restart on Thursday night" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/20/8952506-6629265-image-a-85_1548363596138.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Llorente celebrates with his Spurs team-mates after scoring in the 50th minute of the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox sport" data-version="2" id="mol-f207ccb0-200a-11e9-bea8-8d35f1a6031f">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">MATCH FACTS, PLAYER RATINGS AND MATCH ZONE</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><div class="cleared row mol-cols mol-cols-2" id="mol-fb433bc0-200a-11e9-bea8-8d35f1a6031f">                            <div class="mol-col span6 mol-col-1" style="style">                                <div class="cleared mol-col-content"><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font color="#000000"><strong>Chelsea (4-3-3):</strong> </font>Kepa Arrizabalaga 7, Cesar Azpilicueta  6.5, Antonio Rudiger 7, David Luiz 6.5, Emerson  6.5, Jorginho  7, N’Golo Kante  7, Ross Barkley 6.5 (Kovacic 81), Pedro 7 (Willian 76), Olivier Giroud 6, Eden Hazard 8. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Subs not used:</strong> Caballero, Alonso, Hudson-Odoi, Ampadu, Piazon</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Booked:</strong> Azpilicueta, Jorginho, Kante, Sarri.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Manager:</strong> Maurizio Sarri  7.5</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Tottenham (4-3-1-2): </strong>Paulo Gazzaniga 6, Serge Aurier 5.5, Toby Alderweireld 5.5, Jan Vertonghen 6, Ben Davies  6 (Rose 33, 7.5), Eric Dier 5.5, Harry Winks 7, Moussa Sissoko  6 (Sanchez 80), Christian Eriksen  7, Erik Lamela 6.5, Fernando Llorente 6.5 (Moura 68, 6). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Subs not used:</strong> Lloris, N’Koudou, Walker-Peters, Skipp</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Booked:</strong> Sissoko</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Manager:</strong> Mauricio Pochettino  7</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Referee:</strong> Martin Atkinson 6</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Attendance:</strong> 38,610</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MOM:</strong> Hazard </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">By Sami Mokbel </span></p>                                </div>                            </div><div class="mol-col span6 mol-col-2" style="style">                                <div class="cleared mol-col-content">                                    <img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/20/8951936-6629265-image-a-75_1548362312508.jpg" height="417" width="451" alt="Jesse Lingard doubled Manchester United's lead after a clever counter-attack two minutes after Alexis Sanchez broke the deadlock.

It freed Hazard, and Chelsea were rewarded by his part in the first, plus scoring their second. Round pegs in round holes make a difference.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was so little goalmouth action early on that the most interest came in guessing how many fouls referee Martin Atkinson would allow Dier to commit before reaching for a card. The answer? Three in the first 17 minutes and four in the half.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was ridiculously lenient. None of the offences were greatly serious, but then neither is a minor speeding infringement. Four of them, though, and your licence goes. By the second foul Dier was looking over anxiously, fearing the worst. He need not have worried. Atkinson wasn’t in the mood for any of it. Cards, penalties, little influenced his unseeing eye.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would have been quite an ugly mood at Stamford Bridge come half-time, were it not for the two goals scored by the home team. For very understandable reasons, Tottenham had been toothless, and couldn’t muster a single shot on target. Chelsea had two, and both went in. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/20/8952414-0-image-a-80_1548363350472.jpg" height="514" width="962" alt="" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/20/8951622-6629265-image-a-64_1548361846171.jpg" height="560" width="962" alt="Hazard celebrates after putting Maurizio Sarri's side ahead on aggregate in the Carabao Cup semi-final tie against Tottenham" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/20/8951740-6629265-image-a-69_1548361953026.jpg" height="696" width="962" alt="Hazard is joined by his Chelsea team-mates after scoring their second goal of the game in the first half of League Cup match" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/20/8952222-6629265-image-a-79_1548362834922.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="A dejected Toby Alderweireld after Hazard scored to make it 2-0 to Chelsea on the night and 2-1 on aggregate" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first, from N’Golo Kante, is never to be repeated. Not because he cannot score. For a player so plainly out of position, he does rather well in that area. The manner of it, however — well, that won’t happen twice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ever played crazy golf? You know when some lunatic expects you to get it through the castle entrance, and the windmill, and the little tunnel, all in one putt? Kante’s goal was like success on that hole.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hazard took a corner, the ball was cleared, but only as far as Kante. His shot passed through not so much a crowd of players, as a series of human tunnels — through three sets of legs, emerging at last through Moussa Sissoko to catch Gazzaniga unaware and bisect him, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Justice was eventually done after 38 minutes when Dier at last picked up a punishment of sorts for his fourth foul. Ross Barkley took an excellent quick free-kick from inside his half, picking out Hazard whose midfield carry ended in a pass to Pedro. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He found Cesar Azpilicueta who pulled the ball back into the path of Hazard, arriving late as he usually cannot when played up front by Sarri. Hazard’s finish was lovely leaving Gazzaniga no chance. And Spurs, too, the way the game was going.   </p><video preload="none" id="1848794" title="Chelsea v Tottenham: Sarri after his sides penalties victory" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/23/video-8958348-256_636x358.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/01/24/1369806938401292452/1024x576_MP4_1369806938401292452.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/20/8951156-6629265-image-a-53_1548361074998.jpg" height="640" width="962" alt="Chelsea forward Olivier Giroud tries an acrobatic attempt during the first half of the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/20/8951820-6629265-image-a-71_1548362084845.jpg" height="673" width="962" alt="Chelsea's Cesar Azpilicueta (left) and Tottenham's Harry Winks have words during the first 45 minutes of the encounter" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It almost certainly would have been that way had Atkinson not rejected a penalty appeal a minute before half-time.

How Atkinson judged he could have got the ball without also clearing out the man however, is a mystery — but it kept Spurs in touch, which was all the invitation they needed after half-time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Credit Mauricio Pochettino with influencing his team in the limited time available. They came out a different animal. They stopped Chelsea playing and fed their own monster. No point having a big man like Fernando Llorente out there without playing to his strengths, and the first time it happened, Chelsea faltered.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Danny Rose — on for Ben Davies, who appeared to suffer a groin injury after 33 minutes — hit a lovely cross and Llorente got the right side of Luiz to put a stooping header past Kepa, and draw Spurs level on aggregate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In any other year since 1980, had that scoreline remained, Tottenham would have progressed on away goals.

Let's call them the big three. They are at the very top of the division, and then there's everyone else, who can be interchangeable, yet still dangerous, opponents. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'At Joshua's trajectory, I expected him to face Wilder in 2018. To my disappointment, those negotiations fell through. I've placed a lot of the onus on Hearn and Joshua for that fight not happening. During that time, when I heard Joshua saying he was in no rush to face Wilder, and might do so in 2019, 2020 or beyond, of course I was shocked at those comments. I understand that boxing is a business, but as a fan, I want to see the best fight the best, when they're at their best.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Now I'm not privy to all of the details, and all of the back and forth between the Joshua and Wilder camps, but based on what I've heard, my opinion was that Joshua and Hearn needed to step up their game if this fight was going to happen. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/24/11/8814162-6627515-Tyson_Fury_L_has_yet_to_commit_to_a_rematch_vs_Deontay_WIlder_C_-a-72_1548330333667.jpg" height="474" width="634" alt="Lewis wants Joshua to join Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder in a battle to find his successor" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I thought it was ludicrous that Hearn started off by offering Wilder a paycheck for the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world, instead of a percentage, especially when you consider that they did a 65/35 split with Joseph Parker for a unification bout.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's disrespectful to the fraternity of boxing, and the gains we have made getting fighters a larger percentage of what they put their lives on the line, and work so hard for. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'With Wilder-Fury 2 happening, Eddie is now scrambling for a viable opponent for Joshua. If Joshua handles his business in April, the winner of Wilder-Fury 2 should take on Joshua for the undisputed title.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If that doesn't happen, then we know that it's just about milking the British fans for as much money as possible, instead of bringing the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world back home to them for the second time in their lifetime. Just that simple.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'As for Wilder and Fury, I'm looking forward to the rematch and to see a great fight between two warriors. As a fan, I'm looking forward to seeing how the division gets sorted out, and when we have the emergence of one undisputed champion. I'm hoping the end of 2019, we will have our answers on just who that will be.' </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>Lennox Lewis is calling on Anthony Joshua to join Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder in a three-way battle to find his successor as the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world.

If there is one story that encapsulates the changing currents of Wally Downes' career in football, it is the Lilleshall barbecue.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Downes is taking his coaching badges, and at a frighteningly young age. It doesn't matter. He's a natural.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the end of each day, when the instructors get together, his name is the talk of the table. The sharpest mind, the quickest learner. There are other much bigger, aspiring managers on the course, but the kid from Wimbledon stands out.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/22/20/8853690-0-image-m-2_1548187560313.jpg" height="375" width="634" alt="Wally Downes is back at Wimbledon and looking to pull off a FA Cup upset against West Ham" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the end of the two weeks, his pass mark is the highest ever recorded by the FA. He decides to celebrate with a barbecue, which is how he came to burn down a Listed 17th-century pavilion on site. As this tale is checked for accuracy, Downes looks wounded. It didn't burn down, he insists. Singed is a better description.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'No fire engines were called,' he explains. 'But, no, it wasn't exactly as we found it.' He was, he admits, in charge of the fuel. 'I might have got a bit carried away…'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Getting carried away is what Downes did rather well as the leader of Wimbledon's Crazy Gang. The anecdotes from his playing days have tended to obscure his later successes as a coach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He has been part of unlikely promotions and significant Premier League achievements, such as his time at Reading as assistant to Steve Coppell, securing a record 106 points to win the Championship before finishing eighth in the Premier League in their first season. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He won promotion with West Ham under Sam Allardyce and at QPR with Harry Redknapp.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/22/20/8853976-0-image-a-4_1548187714099.jpg" height="447" width="634" alt="Downes (left) and Steve Coppell (second left) guided Reading to eighth in the Premier League" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now he is back with his first love, his great love, and this time as his own boss. On December 4, Downes was appointed manager of AFC Wimbledon, tasked with saving them from relegation to League Two. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He has lost just three games since, and taken the phoenix club to its first FA Cup fourth-round tie, on Saturday against West Ham. Underdogs again, like old times.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wimbledon are scheduled to make a happy return to Plough Lane next year, but their present ground is so small that pre-match team meetings are held in a function room at Chessington Zoo. Downes can barely keep a straight face as he confirms this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We turned up on Boxing Day, and it was shut,' he says. 'That came as a surprise. I remember the adverts with Anita Harris. "Chessington Zoo, Chessington Zoo, Chessington, Chessington, Chessington Zoo". Open every day of the year, she said. I mean, what's the world coming to when you can't even trust Anita Harris?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wimbledon scrambled around to find an alternate location, before beating Plymouth 2-1, but there is a sense Downes doesn't mind the ramshackle nature of the place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It feels like the old Wimbledon to me, even now,' he says. 'I still see people, faces I remember from 40 years ago - because they supported a club and while it may have changed, they haven't. They didn't go off to Milton Keynes, they didn't start supporting Charlton.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/22/20/8854194-0-image-a-6_1548188005207.jpg" height="374" width="634" alt="Wimbledon's pre-match team meetings are held in a function room at Chessington Zoo" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/22/22/8858112-6620811-image-a-36_1548194797416.jpg" height="210" width="306" alt="" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I recognise people from the old days, but then in another way it's a new club and a new history. The old Wimbledon had almost 100 years behind it before the Crazy Gang came along. Everyone recalls that era, and they think it all started when we came into the League in 1977, but we were a big amateur club before then.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'AFC Wimbledon? This genuinely came from nothing. This came from the worst decision in the history of football. A decision that set a precedent that was so bad, nobody has tried to follow it. But each year since then, they have made their own history, all the way to League One.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I won a single FA Cup game, at Fleetwood, and that made history, too. It's a bit embarrassing to say, because my part is just 90 minutes, but it shows what the club is up against. So it's different in some ways, but with a lot of similarities in others. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'What I remember about Wimbledon first time around is we never played a match, or a season, when we weren't underdogs. The worst paid, the smallest squad, the lowest transfer fees, every year, no matter where we were.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I got offered the chance to go to Doncaster, who were two divisions below us. The manager said, "I can only give you £600 a week" - and I thought, "That's handy, I'm on £300 at Wimbledon".</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And it's like that now. This club came up through the amateur leagues but at the start they had better resources than their rivals. Now we're in League One and we're underdogs again, like we used to be. And we need to be the Wimbledon we were. Young and hungry - because we haven't got the money to take on the others.'</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/22/20/8853742-0-image-m-8_1548188116584.jpg" height="460" width="634" alt="Downes was offered the chance to go to Doncaster and double his £300-a-week wages" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Would he show his squad the Wimbledon history, its legendary FA Cup runs even before League status was achieved?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'What would be the point - I'd need a Betamax recorder,' Downes replies. 'We had this fat reserve goalkeeper back then. He was known as The Flying Pig, but his dad was a traffic copper. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We used to get him to bring in one of his speed cameras, and he'd stand up the back and film our games. But this was years ahead of its time. No one was using video, so we were actually really modern.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Downes was Wimbledon's first apprentice professional, coming through as a teenager with the club on the brink of breaking into the Football League, but catching the tail-end of the amateur years. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dave Bassett coached while running an insurance business and the striker, Ian Cooke, doubled as a bank manager. 'They could all have been professionals, but they had good jobs,' Downes recalls.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They were hard men, though, and you learnt. Our goalkeeper was Richard Teale; big lad from Cumbria. About my third game for the reserves, I was guarding the far post, a corner came in, I chickened out and shouted "keeper's ball". Anyway, total confusion, a head goes up, ball goes in.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/22/20/8853732-6620811-image-a-19_1548188707096.jpg" height="416" width="634" alt="Downes was Wimbledon’s first apprentice professional, coming through as a teenager" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The next thing I'm pinned up against the post, with Richard's hands around my throat. "If it's keeper's ball," he says, "you'll know it's keeper's ball, because I'm the f****** keeper and I'll come for it".</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Not long after that we played Leatherhead. Bassett hated Leatherhead. They had this striker Chris Kelly, who was known as the Leatherhead Lip because he was so mouthy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It was a pre-season game, except to Bassett it's a cup final because of Kelly, and Bassett is assistant manager so he can play where he likes. He fancies himself as Franz Beckenbauer, bringing the ball out from the back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So he takes it off our goalkeeper, Dickie Guy. Two block tackles and a headbutt later and he's reached the edge of his own penalty area. Eventually it's out for a goal-kick.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Dickie goes to get it and this Leatherhead fan won't let go of the ball. Ridiculous. There can't be more than 100 people in the ground, but this bloke's a nutcase. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So Dickie is pulling, and this guy is pulling, then Bassett gets involved because any excuse for a tear-up with Leatherhead, and Kelly and some other fans pile in and now there's a melee.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'At that point, I see a bloke jump over the wall and start running across the pitch towards us. The referee's trying to restore order and no one has noticed this chap getting nearer. It's obviously time for action, so as he goes to run past me I lay him out.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/22/20/8853894-6620811-image-a-21_1548188820504.jpg" height="431" width="634" alt="Downes (right) beats West Ham's Ray Stewart to the ball on a muddy pitch in 1985" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He's flat on his back, the referee's now berserk and Dickie breaks off from wrestling the fan, looks at this starfish on the pitch, rounds on me and shouts, "What the f*** do you think you're doing?" I say, "Dickie, he was going to attack us". He says, "He wasn't going to attack us, that's my f****** brother-in-law!"'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A different time, it's fair to say. Even as a professional in the Football League, Downes ran a fruit and veg stall in Shepherd's Bush market, getting the No 72 bus to training before he learned to drive. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This led to one of the more unusual contract negotiations. 'I turned down a new deal,' he says. 'Bassett wanted to give me a fiver more, but I knew others were getting a tenner, so I said no. He said he had no more money, so that was us looking at each other. I said, "What happens now then?" He said he'd try to think of something.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'A few days later the phone goes. "I've had an idea," Bassett says. "Why don't you have Mondays off?" So I did. I had kept the veg stall, so I went there and made £100 a day. Problem solved.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm not complaining about how it was, about agents or the money players earn. An 18-year-old can't negotiate these days because the clubs would run rings round them. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/22/20/8854794-6620811-image-a-27_1548189200275.jpg" height="486" width="634" alt="Downes (circled) sits on the horse and cart at the Truman Brewery with the Crazy Gang in 1986" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/22/20/8854730-6620811-image-a-24_1548189074527.jpg" height="676" width="634" alt="Dave Bassett coached Wimbledon while running an insurance business" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But players get surrounded by people who don't challenge them, whether it's parents, agents, their entourage - and the money goes up whether they improve or not. Some won't see they need to work on weaknesses. You start on £20,000 a week, end up on £100,000 - they don't think they can be told.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'My background is coaching. I haven't had much time as a manager. I'm not sitting there thinking, "If I can get this 11 out and that 11 in, we'll do all right". I'm looking at my players thinking, "How can I improve them?"</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But it's changed. At a previous club, I took a player out to do some extra work after training because I thought I could improve his crossing. We went with a couple of youth players to work on drills and the next thing his agent is on the line: "Why did you take my player away from the group? He feels humiliated. It's embarrassing for him. You singled him out".</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'No, I'm trying to make him better. Next week it will be somebody else. But that's what you're up against. They think you're bullying if you coach.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These days Downes is supported on the training field by Glyn Hodges, who played on the opposite flank to him in their Crazy Gang days. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Downes is full of praise for Hodges' coaching and organisational skills and his left foot is still sweet enough to be admired by the younger members of the squad. It didn't, however, always find favour with his team-mates.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/22/20/8853708-6620811-image-a-25_1548189094813.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Downes is supported on the training field by former Grazy Gang team-mate Glyn Hodges (left)" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There was one game when we came in at half-time and Alan Cork started taking his boots off,' Downes recalls. 'He says, "Right, that's it, I'm not playing, I've had enough". Bassett's trying to give his team talk and Cork's in the background chuntering away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So Bassett stops. "What are you doing Corky, put your boots on". He says, "No, I'm finished. Get a sub on". Corky gestures to me and Glyn. "It's them. They keep passing to my feet. They know I'm no good with my feet".</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So there's a moment of silence as we absorb this bombshell, and then Bassett rounds on the pair of us. "What do you keep passing to his feet for? You know he can't play with his feet!"</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So we're stuffed. Every time we put in a low cross after that, Corky would give us this disapproving look and warn, "Boots off".</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Glyn was a better player than I was, but we used to sit together in one corner of the changing room and I'd catch all his flak. Bassett would be raging at half-time and Glyn would pick up the programme and start reading. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Then Bassett would see him. "Hodges, put that programme down. I'm warning you, put that f****** programme down". And then he'd start on me because I was in the crossfire.'</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/22/20/8853706-6620811-image-a-26_1548189180835.jpg" height="375" width="634" alt="Downes is realistic about Wimbledon's chances against West Ham in the FA Cup on Saturday" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Downes is realistic about Wimbledon's chances against a West Ham team enjoying a resurgence under Manuel Pellegrini. The football, and the club's ambition, are far removed from his time there with Allardyce. The end is one of his genuine regrets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I still don't know what went wrong for me at West Ham,' he adds. 'We'd got back to the Premier League, we were 11th, two points off Arsenal in seventh, and we'd just beaten Chelsea 3-1.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Sam called me in and said, "I don't think it's working". There was no real explanation. I read in his book that he thought I wanted to be assistant manager. I didn't like that. He made it sound as if I was plotting. I absolutely wasn't. I had no ambitions there at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The assistant has to know the manager, the way Glyn knows me, and I didn't really know Sam. He inherited me. I was a coach, that's all I wanted to be. So I've always felt a bit in the dark, really.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe there was a simpler explanation. Maybe Sam thought he was planning another barbecue.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW BY MARTIN SAMUEL: Let’s start with the barbecue.

Higuain must be registered as a Chelsea player by midday on Wednesday in order to play in the tie, which sees Spurs lead 1-0 from the first leg at Wembley. However, there is no guarantee he would play even if he were to sign in time, with boss Maurizio Sarri notoriously meticulous on preparations with his

Here, he is fast running out of time. It is six years since any golfer won a major in his forties, and that was 43-year-old Phil Mickelson at the 2013 Open. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ray Floyd, Lee Trevino and Nicklaus himself all won majors at an age older than Woods but not more than one. No golfer has come close to winning four after the age of 43, which is what Woods needs to do to catch the Golden Bear.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/21/21/8809260-6616957-image-a-30_1548105476664.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="The 14-time major winner needs a strong year to catch Jack Nicklaus' record of 18" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">One thing on his side is that he could not have hand-picked better venues than this year's crop.

Before fatigue derailed him at the Ryder Cup, Woods was swinging the club as well as in his prime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If that felt like one of the sporting wonders of the modern age, after all he had been through, no wonder the prospect of what might happen over the coming months generates such boundless excitement.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>QUOTE OF THE WEEK</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>'Holy Cow.

He said that in his second game as Middlesbrough manager, his team beat <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/jose_mourinho/index.html" id="mol-177c0b50-1dcc-11e9-b9b9-897a9ba50bdb">Jose Mourinho</a>'s Chelsea 2-1.

Some people - <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/arsene-wenger/index.html" id="mol-177bbd30-1dcc-11e9-b9b9-897a9ba50bdb">Arsene Wenger</a> among them, no less - were saying he was a potential England manager.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/21/20/8807120-6616637-image-a-1_1548100966589.jpg" height="418" width="634" alt="Gareth Southgate was honoured by the Football Writers' Association on The Savoy on Sunday" /><video preload="none" id="1825470" title="Gareth Southgate arrives at the Sports Personality of the Year awards" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/16/18/7496320-0-image-m-4_1544985854957.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2018/12/16/7493043801423039769/1024x576_MP4_7493043801423039769.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><p class="mol-para-with-font">And then Middlesbrough went down and he was sacked, while still in the Championship. Suddenly, it looked as if he might not get a second chance as a manager at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Peculiar, isn't it, football? Read any book by a leader in business, a tycoon, a successful individual in just about any field and they will trot out the same mantra: you learn more from failure than you do success. And everybody nods sagely and thinks: how wise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Except the owners of football clubs. They will take that lesson from Richard Branson or Bill Gates, or even Ellen DeGeneres, but will not apply it in their own world.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nobody learns from failure in football. Failure gets you the sack and often, as Southgate acknowledged, careers end there. Southgate still hasn't had a job in club football since leaving Middlesbrough and while he may get linked with vacancies at Manchester United these days, he needed to come fourth in a World Cup to make that leap. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/21/20/8807270-6616637-image-m-3_1548101236484.jpg" height="562" width="634" alt="Southgate struggled at Middlesbrough and is a prime example you can learn from failures" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nobody was touting him for a Premier League return when he was impressing as England's Under 21 coach. He was still defined by a single relegation, an event that happened as Middlesbrough manager when he was 38. Few considered that he might have learned from the experience, or that Middlesbrough's changing circumstances may also have played a part.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let's face it, for all the plaudits, Southgate is only England manager now because Sam Allardyce got legged over by a hidden tape recorder and the Football Association reacted in haste. Without that episode, Southgate's talent would still be concealed by Middlesbrough's shadow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, not every negative experience is teachable, but many are, particularly for a young coach. Burnley judged that Sean Dyche would learn from relegation to the Championship in 2014-15, and were proven right: he guided them back to the Premier League at the first attempt and has kept them there since.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Credit to Ed Woodward, too, for deciding that a poor nine months at Cardiff in 2014 did not fairly capture Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's potential as a manager, and that he could lift Manchester United after the departure of Jose Mourinho. Yet these are exceptions, in Solskjaer's case helped by his playing reputation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Around the bottom of tables outside the Premier League are managers toiling in virtual anonymity, who may never catch another break if their first career opportunity proves a dead end. What knowledge is lost, what experience wasted if failure is seen as a life sentence? </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/21/20/8807360-6616637-image-m-5_1548101490293.jpg" height="418" width="634" alt="Burnley have been proven right for thinking Sean Dyche would learn from relegation" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Paul Scholes looks likely to be Oldham's 27th manager since Joe Royle left in 1994. There have been a number of caretakers and John Sheridan has enjoyed four spells with the club, but even removing these statistical anomalies, it works out that roughly one third have never been able to get a manager's job in English football again, after leaving.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not that Oldham alone is a black hole for ambition - those figures would no doubt be replicated at a great many clubs. If anything, Oldham's reputation for getting through managers probably aids future employment chances. It is the lower league equivalent of being sacked by Chelsea: you are held less responsible. Indeed, Chelsea are the perfect example of the dual standard. They burn through managers every other season, yet there is no comparable evidence of Roman Abramovich being this impatient in his business life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Under Abramovich five managers have lasted a year or less, yet Marina Granovskaia, who effectively runs Chelsea day by day, is entirely unaffected by unsuccessful appointments, poor signings, costly departures or rotten results.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe some managers cannot change, and Chelsea tend to go for high achievers who are likely to be set in their ways. Yet if Granovskaia may be learning from the way Chelsea see-saw between success and failure, no such luck for the managers, no matter their status or past achievements. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/21/20/8808142-6616637-image-a-6_1548103262285.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Roman Abramovich's quick to sack managers but doesn't seem as impatient in his business life" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Roberto Di Matteo did not make it to the end of November, despite delivering the Champions League trophy. It was his third full-time job after a year at Milton Keynes Dons and 18 months at West Bromwich Albion. The year he was sacked by Chelsea he won six games on the spin, followed by a run of one win in eight - might he have learned from what was, in essence, a difficult spell?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anyway, learning never stops. Fabio Capello was disappointing as England manager at the 2010 World Cup yet it is often overlooked that this was his first tournament as an international manager. He thought he could prepare the players as he did a club team in pre-season, but was wrong. Players are exhausted at the end of a campaign. He worked them too hard, the team base was too isolated, it was an unhappy camp.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In all likelihood, his strategy would have been very different at the 2012 European Championship, had FA chairman David Bernstein not dismally engineered his departure. Capello would have learned from those mistakes, in a way the FA, and some football clubs, rarely learn from theirs: which is probably why we end up hiring halls at the Savoy to celebrate semi-finals.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Henry's anger management</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thierry Henry, once an urbane, unruffled presence in the television studio, lost his rag and called the grandmother of an opponent a 'whore' during a 5-1 defeat by Strasbourg.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Incredibly, this incendiary reaction was the result of time-wasting at a throw-in. Henry's Monaco are still 19th in the French top flight and battling to avoid relegation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That this man has been reduced to furiously targeting old ladies after three months in management perhaps shows why so many prefer the comfort of the sofa to the realities of the dugout. Did he not note what the job could do to sophisticated ally Arsene Wenger?</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Mo doesn't want to be known as new Suarez</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">If Mo Salah earns a reputation for diving it will hurt Liverpool more than any rival. The club have been here before with Luis Suarez. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once referees thought they were being conned he couldn't buy a penalty. In what proved his final season in England, Suarez was probably harder done by than any striker in the country. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Referees don't wish to be made to look foolish in the post-match analysis so he stopped getting the benefit of the doubt. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It will start happening to Salah soon - and at the time of the season when the smallest shake of the head could influence the destination of the trophy. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jurgen Klopp needs to shut this down, and quick.  </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/21/20/8808626-6616637-image-m-15_1548104110841.jpg" height="504" width="634" alt="Mohamed Salah doesn't want to earn a reputation for diving - it will hurt Liverpool's title tilt" /><video preload="none" id="1844986" title="Klopp relieved after Liverpool&amp;#39;s narrow 4-3 win over Palace" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/19/18/video-8735730-382_636x358.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/01/19/2638501848779437939/1024x576_MP4_2638501848779437939.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">No wonder clubs are ganging up on Leeds</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is hard to have great sympathy for Leeds, with 11 of their rivals ganging up to put a spoke in their wheels by complaining to the Football League about the spying controversy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leeds, after all, were among those pressing administrators to investigate Wolves over their links to Jorge Mendes last season and they have been highly active in protesting against the television deal, with the attendant threat of a breakaway to Premier League 2.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This might be classed as payback time. Yet, without specific regulations in place governing spying, it is hard to see how Leeds have broken any rules bar the agreement to act in good faith.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And while that is a catch-all charge - much like bringing the game into disrepute - it is not one that should see individuals banned or points deducted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A warning and suspended sentence, at most a fine, should suffice. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/21/21/8808894-6616637-image-a-19_1548104542102.jpg" height="425" width="634" alt="Leeds were one " /><p class="mol-para-with-font">One road to nowhere, however, is to argue, as Gary Neville and others have done, that moral judgments are hypocritical because journalists spy on training to get information all the time. These are entirely separate issues. There is no good faith arrangement between journalists and the teams they cover. Their job is to win football matches, ours is to accurately inform our readers in the hope they will buy our newspaper.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If we have information, it is our duty, our job, to share it. Why would you pay 70p otherwise? 'We know the team but we're not going to tell you. Now give us your money.' That's not a business plan for any news organisation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, just because journalists have been known to spy on training does not make it right that teams spy on each other in such an overt manner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leeds and Derby sign up to behave faithfully to one another: a vague clause, yes, but one that covers tapping up, poaching managers and staff mid-season, and in this case, spying.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe, in the future, the League might wish to set out precisely what good faith entails, but if the clubs would rather keep the definition woolly, there's a reason for that.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">No doubting Serena is the real No 1 </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to the Women's Tennis Association rankings, Simona Halep is the world's best player. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her record against Serena Williams now stands at a single win in 10. This explains Halep's modesty when, before their meeting in the last 16 of the Australian Open, she described Williams as 'the real No 1'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She looked all of that on Monday, beating Halep across three sets including 6-1 in the first, in 20 minutes. If she equals Margaret Court's record of 24 Grand Slam titles, at the age of 37, with a 17-month old daughter at home, it will be one the greatest achievements in sport.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The US Open final tantrum was a low point, but no bad day can put a dent in Williams' career. She deserves to stand at the pinnacle above any player, male or female.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/21/21/8808888-6616637-image-a-17_1548104510174.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Serena Williams looked the real No 1 as she beat Simona Halep at Australia Open on Monday" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maria Sharapova did not intentionally cheat by talking meldonium and she has a team of lawyers very willing to explain the technicalities of this ruling, if required. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nor did she cheat when disappearing into the toilet for seven minutes, just as her opponent Ashleigh Barty was gaining enormous momentum having taken the second set of their Australian Open match 6-1. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet Sharapova was roundly booed on her return and all the way to defeat. And while this verdict won't stand up in any court, there are some judgements that can't be found in books. It doesn't make them any less valid.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Brady is one of the best ever in sport</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tom Brady was already the oldest quarterback to feature in a Super Bowl. Now, at 41, he is going back again in search of an unprecedented sixth victory. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His play-off display against the Kansas City Chiefs brought back memories of Super Bowl win No 5 - which is already the NFL's equivalent of Istanbul 2005, with Brady as Steven Gerrard plus plus. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Awaiting the New England Patriots are the LA Rams and Jared Goff, who was seven when Brady won his first ring. It does not matter whether you understand this sport, or not: Brady's is one of the greatest athletic careers.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">It's all quiet on Higuain making his cup debut...</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some may be wondering exactly how it is that Gonzalo Higuain could join the Carabao Cup semi-final between Chelsea and Tottenham at what is effectively half-time, if he arrives at Stamford Bridge this week and plays in the second leg. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here's the explanation: it's a silent rule. In 2009, Tottenham signed Jermain Defoe from Portsmouth. When he arrived the club had already played the first leg of a League Cup semi-final with Burnley, winning 4-1. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having first made his league debut, Defoe was named in the squad for the return at Turf Moor. Burnley checked with the Football League. The club presumed, as aggregate scores were taken into account and away goals counted double, that the tie started with the first leg and a new player wasn't eligible. The League disagreed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Burnley asked where this unusual regulation could be found and were told it wasn't in the rulebook. It was, apparently 'a silent rule'. The League had nothing to cover this eventuality, so a player was said to be registered as soon as he was available for league matches. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, with Higuain confirmed as able to play it seems either the League have not closed that loophole in 10 years, or the silent rules are now recorded. Bottom line, if he's registered, he's in.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/21/20/8807788-6616637-image-a-16_1548104364919.jpg" height="447" width="634" alt="Silent rule could allow Gonzalo Higuain play in Chelsea's Carabao Cup semi-final second leg" /><video preload="none" id="1840438" title="Gonzalo Higuain linked to Chelsea in latest transfer rumours" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/12/8462344-0-image-m-10_1547382085404.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/01/13/3328834828208522662/1024x576_MP4_3328834828208522662.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>MARTIN SAMUEL - CHIEF SPORTS WRITER:Gareth Southgate had the humility to look slightly embarrassed at The Savoy on Sunday.

They were big points, too, about motivation and personality. Chelsea lacked both, apparently.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They were a hard team to motivate, a team not known for battling or fighting qualities, that lacked mental aggression, determination and ferocity, that missed leadership. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This would have been easier to process if Chelsea’s team did not include some of the strongest footballers of the modern era.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">N’Golo Kante, widely acknowledged as the finest central defensive midfielder in Europe until Sarri arrived and started playing him at right-half. Kante has won two Premier League titles with Chelsea and Leicester and a World Cup with France. And he lacks fighting qualities?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eden Hazard is a Footballer of the Year, a Players’ Player of the Year, Silver Ball winner at the 2018 World Cup — and he is without mental aggression?</p><video preload="none" id="1786144" title="Maurizio Sarri on Eden Hazard: &amp;#39;He can win everything&amp;#39;" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/19/14/5201914-0-image-a-2_1539957470858.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2018/10/19/2932113632240682936/1024x576_MP4_2932113632240682936.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/20/21/8768984-0-image-a-3_1548018371376.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The Italian was left furious by his team's performance and accused them of lacking motivation" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The prizes won by Chelsea’s starting XI included two World Cups, one European Championship, seven Champions Leagues, three Europa Leagues, 25 national titles across six countries and the FA Cup on eight occasions. Not bad for a group without personality.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chelsea can be a troublesome bunch, though, we know that. In recent years, impressive peaks have been followed by inexplicable troughs. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They can abandon a manager almost in a fit of pique. Yet Chelsea’s faltering in recent weeks does not appear entirely the fault of the starting XI.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sarri is married to a rigid system of play that appears not to suit a significant number of his players. He complained that Chelsea lacked commitment in losing to Arsenal, but so many in his team have their energies exhausted trying to make Sarri-ball work.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kante no longer guards, Hazard no longer creates and all orbits around lynchpin Jorginho, who would no doubt have appeared considerably more effective in the half-pace of the Italian league. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He isn’t outstandingly quick of foot or thought and when a team swarms around him — as Arsenal did on Saturday — any pass of more than limited ambition frequently goes astray.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That Sarri spoke of Arsenal wanting victory more says much. Few elite teams have been accused of wanting it less than Arsenal and for Unai Emery’s players to be held up as personifications of commitment shows how sluggish Chelsea have become. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is generous in the extreme to afford them a single shot at goal, as some statisticians did — crediting a late cross by Marcos Alonso that Arsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno dealt with as it came within range. Without that, Chelsea last got an effort on target in the 63rd minute against Newcastle on January 12.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/20/21/8769164-0-image-a-5_1548018770765.jpg" height="457" width="634" alt="Under Sarri, World Cup winner N'Golo Kante has been switched from his holding position" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was this fixture in the 2016-17 season that precipitated the change that won Chelsea the league. After losing 3-0 at Arsenal, Antonio Conte went from four to three at the back and Chelsea won 13 games on the spin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sarri is offering no such escape clause. ‘Conte changed to a three-man defence, but he was used to doing that anyway, so it wasn’t quite the same,’ he said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘This is the football I have. I am a good teacher of this football, so I don’t think it would be a good idea if I try to teach my players a different type of football.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In other words — Sarri-ball is great, says man called Sarri. Yet what of the others? What of those not called Sarri? Does it suit them? It did not seem to on Saturday, when Arsenal’s midfield ran the game and the defence were very lightly raced, for all Chelsea’s possession.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If Sarri is the great coach he has been painted, why can’t he tweak his system just a little to accommodate the players he has? It does not do to greatly pull at the threads of his logic. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It wasn’t long ago that he was saying the captaincy was an irrelevance and expressing bemusement at the English fascination for it. Now he says Chelsea lack leadership. So which one is it?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Emery will vouch for the difficulties a manager faces trying to change the culture of a club. The stand-off with Mesut Ozil — an unused substitute again and not missed — is a perfect example of a new manager in a head-on collision with a previous regime. Ozil was an important part of what Arsene Wenger was trying to achieve whereas he is a luxury item, at best, for Emery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Arsenal were significantly quicker into the game than Chelsea, and had already missed several good chances when Alexandre Lacazette put them one up from a tight angle. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Laurent Koscielny’s second, an attempted header that spun off his shoulder, gave Arsenal distance and Chelsea barely threatened in response.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their last decent opportunity came before half-time when Marcos Alonso’s header struck a post. That aside, Arsenal had them in hand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was the first time since February 2004 that Arsenal have won consecutive home games against Chelsea.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Chelsea are a team that wants to play building up with very big possession,’ said Emery. ‘I like to press against these teams.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In other words, Chelsea did what Arsenal hoped they would do, what Arsenal knew they would do, because there is so little variation in their play.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/20/21/8769182-0-image-a-6_1548018797936.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Summer signing Jorginho is at the core of Sarri's blueprint, but has failed to impress so far" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nobody is suggesting Sarri tells his team to play long but it is interesting that when David Luiz struck one of his raking early passes, he came closest to putting Pedro in — as happened against Newcastle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I think if you asked at the beginning of the season, can Chelsea keep the ball, people would have said no,’ explained Luiz. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘And now we are able to do that, like the best teams in the world. So this is our philosophy. I believe in it, I trust it, I just know we have to improve.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘What Sarri has done is unbelievable, amazing, because normally a team needs one or two years to understand this philosophy. Everybody is trusting his job and everybody is with him.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Everybody? Social media footage from the away end suggests patience is wearing thin with Sarri-ball, in the cheap seats at least. And no translator was required to understand that message.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>MARTIN SAMUEL - CHIEF SPORTS WRITER AT THE EMIRATES: If Chelsea took as many risks in games as their manager did in his post-match analysis, there would be no problem.

This time, rather than the usual goal machine, the name on their lips was Harry Winks, who appeared at the back post to score for the first time in more than two years after a long and selfless shift, deep in midfield. Less than 20 seconds of stoppage time remained when Winks pounced to crush Fulham, just as they were preparing to add a hard-earned and deserved point to their survival fund.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Daily Mail</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Matt Barlow for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-20T20:40:55.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Fulham 1-2 Tottenham: Harry Winks snatches last-gasp win</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-20T20:40:55.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Fulham,Tottenham Hotspur,Premier League</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/20/19/8767238-0-image-a-14_1548013564387.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6612663/Ryan-Babels-debut-gives-Fulham-fans-cause-optimism-despite-defeat.html" title="Ryan Babel shows promise on return to English football as his debut gives Fulham fans some reason for optimism despite last-gasp defeat by Tottenham "></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6612969/Dele-Alli-doubt-Carabao-Cup-semi-final-against-Chelsea-Spurs-star-walks-against-Fulham.html" title="Dele Alli a doubt for Carabao Cup semi-final at Chelsea with suspected hamstring injury... as Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino admits 'it does not look great'"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6612165/Fulham-vs-Tottenham-LIVE-score-updates-Premier-League.html" title="Fulham 1-2 Tottenham, RESULT – Harry Winks heads home dramatic late goal as Spurs turn it round"></atom:link></item><item><title>Huddersfield 0-3 Manchester City: Danilo, Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sane strike as Pep Guardiola's side cut Liverpool's lead back down to four points</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6612673/Huddersfield-0-3-Manchester-City-Danilo-Raheem-Sterling-Leroy-Sane-strike.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jan 2019 15:22:38 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6612673</guid><description><![CDATA[IAN LADYMAN AT JOHN SMITH'S STADIUM: It is at this stage of the season that the really good teams manage to win games while playing within themselves.

It said more about City, though.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is the Premier League champions' relentless brilliance that has steadily sucked the optimism and courage out of the majority of opponents over the last two seasons. It is City that arrive at so many grounds to find teams already on the mental retreat, scared to engage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And that certainly helps on days like this, days when standards slip.

It helps to keep City in the slipstream of Liverpool ahead of a title race denouement that surely will take us all the way to the final weeks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Liverpool remain favourites this season because they have a points advantage. However, it is not unfeasible that City win every game between now and the season's end. They are probably the one team in the country capable of doing that and days like this only underline just how much quality they do have. Liverpool really should not rest easy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here there was no Silva – Bernardo or David – in the City line-up and no Riyad Mahrez in the squad at all.

On reflection, City probably only played at full tilt for a total of about 20 minutes and, as unintentional as it was, maybe that is the perfect recipe for a time of year when fixtures arrive so relentlessly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Huddersfield were very poor and for the Yorkshire club there would appear to be no way out of their current predicament. Strangely, there seems to have been some kind of acceptance of their fate. At half-time, the stadium announcer congratulated Huddersfield on a good first half, even though they were losing. At the end, the home team were applauded warmly from the field.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If this analysis seems harsh then so be it. But Huddersfield are in trouble and need points.

We expected City to kick on but it didn't really happen until early in the second half.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/20/14/8760092-0-image-a-127_1547994015907.jpg" height="640" width="962" alt="Pep Guardiola used the break for the goal to give Kyle Walker some tactical instructions for when play restarted" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/20/14/8760090-0-image-a-134_1547994055351.jpg" height="871" width="962" alt="Sane (left) and Sterling (right) congratulate Danilo for the goal - scored after 18 minutes at the John Smith's Stadium" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/20/16/8762664-0-image-a-19_1548000515232.jpg" height="642" width="962" alt="" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sterling's goal in the 54th minute – a diving header from a Sane cross – was one for the cameras.

Kevin de Bruyne hassled Jason Puncheon in to a mistake in the centre of the field and when the Huddersfield debutant gave the ball away Danilo was able to play it forwards to Sergio Aguero.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aguero's header down in to Sane's path was perfectly executed and when the German ran clear he had the presence of mind to cushion the ball gently past Lossl rather than go for spectacular and unnecessary power.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After that City retreated a little.

One of the many remarkable things about Manchester City is that they can do this and still score three goals. It sounds strange, but this was as modest a performance we have seen from City and that includes the occasional game they have lost. For the first 45 minutes, Pep Guardiola’s team were poor, giving the ball away, making bad decisions and strangely low on tempo and rhythm. Nevertheless, the game was over by the hour. This said much about Huddersfield, a team that will be down by Easter unless the replacement for the departed David Wagner manages to find the belief, enthusiasm and energy that was so miserably lacking here. It said more about City, though.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ian Ladyman for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-20T23:31:43.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Huddersfield 0-3 Manchester City: Danilo, Sterling and Sane secure win</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-20T23:31:43.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Pep Guardiola,Ederson Moraes,Huddersfield,Kevin De Bruyne,Raheem Sterling,Premier League,Manchester City,Sergio Aguero</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/20/19/8767240-0-image-a-17_1548013599637.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6612153/Huddersfield-vs-Manchester-City-LIVE-score-updates-Premier-League.html" title="Huddersfield 0-1 Manchester City, LIVE – Danilo's deflected effort hands Pep Guardiola's side the lead after stonewall Raheem Sterling penalty is turned down"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6611083/Pep-Guardiola-chase-quadruple-despite-Man-Citys-possible-pile-up.html" title="'Of course I am concerned but what can we do?': Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola to keep pushing for glory in all four competitions despite the crazy fixture pile-up success may cause"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6607825/Everybody-does-Manchester-City-boss-Pep-Guardiola-admits-spying-opponents-abroad.html" title="'Everybody does it': Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola admits to spying on opponents, but insists he has never done so in England"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6607419/We-thinking-Manchester-City-considering-signing-cover-injury-hit-Benjam-Mendy.html" title="'We are thinking about that': Manchester City considering signing cover for injury-hit Benjamin Mendy with Ben Chilwell the top target"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6608061/Manchester-City-boss-gets-involved-Benjamin-Mendy-pounced-team-mates-training.html" title="Pep's still got it!

Alongside Lowry, South African Richard Sterne was playing flawlessly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was entirely appropriate that events would swing back towards Lowry at the par three 12th. In holing his 10-foot birdie putt, Lowry became the first in European Tour history to muster 11 twos in the same tournament.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another birdie followed at the 13th, from 30 feet, and now it was Sterne who was feeling the pressure. After only two bogeys in his first 67 holes, he had two more at the 14th and 16th to lose his lead. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/19/14/8729052-0-image-a-66_1547906752393.jpg" height="431" width="634" alt="Lowry celebrated with the trophy after backing up his earlier rounds with a strong finish" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the 17th, Lowry holed perhaps the gutsiest putt of his career. After getting back on level terms it would have been a savage blow if he'd bogeyed here, but he played a marvelous recovery and followed it by holing the par putt from 15 feet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the par five 18th, Sterne carved his second shot to the right, while Lowry found the middle of the putting surface with another clutch shot. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sterne couldn't get down in two, leaving Lowry with a short putt to complete a win that was inconceivable just 90 minutes earlier. The Irishman's closing 71 saw him finish on an 18-under-par score of 270.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I thought I showed a bit of bottle there, and a bit of character, which I didn't at the US Open,' Lowry said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was a textbook example of how hard it is to win. Lowry provided a further illustration when admitting how difficult he had found it sleeping on the lead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'All sorts of things went through my head,' he said. 'In the middle of the night, I was envisaging being back at the Masters and my two-year-old girl running around at Augusta in a white boiler suit, caddying in the par three. It's hard to keep your mind clear when you've had a few tough years.' </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/19/14/8729064-0-image-m-68_1547906847643.jpg" height="483" width="634" alt="Richard Sterne pushed Lowry close and the pair were tied on the 18th hole " /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He's had that all right, since that fateful US Open at Oakmont. Last year, he played so poorly on the PGA Tour that he lost his card. He returned to Europe with an 18-month plan that he hopes will end with a place in Padraig Harrington's Ryder Cup team.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lowry, who collected a cheque for £905,000, has certainly made a good start. This had been a stroke-play round that turned into a match-play occasion, with clear daylight between the leading pair and everyone else. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ian Poulter suffered a triple bogey at the 16th to fall from third into a tie for sixth with Paul Waring, who played alongside world No 2 Brooks Koepka and beat him by a shot. Koepka finished tied 9th, so Justin Rose will be world No 1 for a fourth consecutive week.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>DEREK LAWRENSON: At the end of a roller-coaster final round that rather summed up his career, Shane Lowry raised his arms slowly to the heavens and pumped his fists in triumph.

His brother Mathias, a third-tier footballer in <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/france/index.html" id="mol-83410d90-1aa7-11e9-b6b1-95dfda26d990">France</a>, was even more direct. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/17/19/8664822-6604397-image-a-18_1547754858960.jpg" height="381" width="634" alt="Paul Pogba cannot just 'go play' - there has to be discipline in midfield or the team falls apart" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The problem was Jose Mourinho right down the line,' he said. 'I know my brother, you tell him, "Go — go play", the rest he will do.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Go play. The emptiest words in football's lexicon. Messi can go play. Cristiano Ronaldo can go play. Most of those in Toure's XI could, too. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pogba? He's a central midfielder. There has to be discipline and responsibility in his game, or the team falls apart. There will be times when he must track, or defend. If Solskjaer is winning hearts and minds at Manchester United with empty promises about just going out and playing, it is a matter of time before he comes unstuck.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It almost happened at Wembley on Sunday. The result and performance were a triumph for Solskjaer but he will know that with better finishing from Tottenham in the second half he could have lost — and part of the reason was Pogba decided to just play.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were 43 minutes gone when Tottenham lost Moussa Sissoko. Until that point he had been keeping a steady eye on Pogba, but within a minute of his departure, the Manchester United man played the pass of the game to put in Marcus Rashford for United's goal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Without a defensive midfield detail to guard him, it seemed Pogba might run riot in the second half — instead he as good as knocked off. He barely tracked back, he lost the ball in positions that launched Tottenham counter- attacks — and David de Gea ended up saving United.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were some outstanding, dutiful defensive performances to earn three points, but Pogba's was not among them. Yet after the game he was lauded, and lauded Solskjaer in turn, too. Increasingly, we hear United's players want the caretaker to get the job. No doubt they do if the mantra is go play.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I had to defend too much before,' Pogba explained. 'This is my position. The manager tells me to get in the box and score goals. The best example is Frank Lampard.'</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/17/19/8664846-6604397-image-a-21_1547754984976.jpg" height="397" width="634" alt="Pogba played a match-winning pass against Tottenham, but switched off as United defended" /><video preload="none" id="1844100" title="Solskjaer: Pogba as one of the &amp;#39;best midfielders going forward&amp;#39;" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/18/01/8676330-0-image-a-2_1547776584637.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/01/18/9166392594174593931/1024x576_MP4_9166392594174593931.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><p class="mol-para-with-font">Is it? Pogba has 58 goals in his entire career. Lampard got more than that in any three seasons added together between 2004-05 and 2009-10. He also matched Pogba's total in just the final five seasons of his career, including his time in New York and as a sub with Manchester City.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pogba has never scored more than eight goals in any league season. Lampard beat that total for 10 years straight. He averaged a goal every 3.07 games for Chelsea; Pogba one every 5.23 for Juventus, even before Mourinho put on the brakes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So Pogba is a midfield player. A very fine one, capable of playing a match-winning pass and dominating big matches, but a midfield player nonetheless.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He doesn't get a free rein. He doesn't get to go play. He has to do his work, and follow his man when necessary — particularly in a team that already includes three forwards in Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and, when he is fit, Alexis Sanchez.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For if Pogba doesn't do his shift then that attitude will spread and if Solskjaer isn't prepared to tell him the truth about his role, then he's not the man for the job. Sir Alex Ferguson didn't require anyone to just play: not Paul Scholes, not Ryan Giggs, not even Ronaldo.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/17/19/8664848-6604397-image-a-23_1547755005883.jpg" height="410" width="634" alt="Pogba does not have the goal return to justify being given free rein to play as he pleases" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Listen to Sam, Huddersfield</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sam Allardyce is justifiably proud of having avoided relegation as a Premier League manager, so it is no surprise he is steering clear of Huddersfield.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He is right, too, in identifying their problem: 13 goals in 22 matches. Huddersfield are doomed unless they sign a prolific striker, and there is little indication they have the finance or will to do that in this transfer window.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Allardyce's advice? Prepare for the Championship next season and hope to regroup to return at the first attempt. Allardyce  would know.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/17/19/8664858-6604397-image-a-24_1547755019840.jpg" height="454" width="634" alt="It is no surprise Sam Allardyce is steering clear of the managerial position at Huddersfield" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Spurs' lack of depth threatens their top four bid </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harry Kane's injury is viewed as an opportunity for Tottenham to show they are not a one-man team - but Tottenham are a one-man team. Not in a derogatory sense, but because Kane is their only elite-class striker.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Son Heung-min is away on international duty, Lucas Moura is returning from injury and both tend to play supporting roles, rather than leading the line. This leaves Fernando Llorente, who last scored a Premier League goal on January 2, 2018.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The best option may yet be to play Moura, if fit, with Dele Alli in support, but that is not the same as having Kane.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tottenham's squad is relatively small, and when injuries bite, they become a one-man team in several positions. Yet still they reduce.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Given their paucity of options in midfield, why sell Mousa Dembele to China? Daniel Levy may consider £11million a good deal for a 31-year-old who is out of contract in the summer, but is it, in the circumstances?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tottenham are a point ahead of Chelsea who have played without a striker of Kane's talent all season — and that may be about to change with the arrival of Gonzalo Higuain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, Manchester United are coming strong, rejuvenated by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The depth of Tottenham's squad could make the difference in securing a Champions League place next season. Why weaken?</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/17/19/8561482-6604397-image-a-26_1547755030496.jpg" height="390" width="634" alt="Harry Kane's injury is viewed as an opportunity for Tottenham - but they are a one-man team" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>O'Neill's romantic tale is unlikely to have a happy ending </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Martin O'Neill should be the perfect manager of Nottingham Forest. Who doesn't love the romance of the former player coming to the rescue of the club he loves?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The hope is that O'Neill succeeds and, most importantly, that he is given time to do so. And that, sadly, is where the romance ends.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">O'Neill's predecessor, Aitor Karanka, was doing a good job. The Championship is hugely competitive this year, but he had Forest in the mix for the play-offs, and had steered them to wins over Leeds, Sheffield United and Middlesbrough, achieving draws with Norwich, West Bromwich and Derby.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet Karanka felt sufficiently at risk of the sack from owner Evangelos Marinakis to walk out last week. Will it be any different for O'Neill? The fans will feel bonded to him instantly, but Marinakis does not share their memories and loyalties. Equally, O'Neill is not the type to tolerate interference from above — and that is before the volatile Roy Keane arrives as his No 2.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The club statement announcing the managerial appointment said the aim was to 'make the miracle happen again'. A cynic might say it would be a miracle if it ended happily at all, no matter the joyous peal of wedding bells.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/17/19/8664912-6604397-image-a-30_1547755065234.jpg" height="431" width="634" alt="Martin O'Neill has made a dream return to Nottingham Forest - but romance won't last for long" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>I spy Bielsa's game... </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For once, the Football League rose to the occasion. There are, they confirm, rules that govern the Leeds spying scandal. Regulation 3.4 speaks of clubs behaving towards each other with 'utmost good faith', while Regulation 21.2.1 governs bringing the game into disrepute. In other words: play nice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A lot of folk have made excuses for cheating this week, sought equivalencies and tried on the clothes of the only grown-up in the village.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They all do it, they're all at it, and everyone seeks to gain an advantage, runs the argument. To which the reply is: they don't, they're not, and yes, but there are boundaries.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some have even argued this makes Marcelo Bielsa the ultimate professional, because he goes to such lengths to win — which is a similar argument used to justify the worst excesses of Luis Suarez. Meanwhile, Bielsa has decided the best defence is to be, on the surface, almost ruinously honest by admitting he spied on everybody.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This cleverly supports the claim that he did not know he was doing wrong, so that is why he did it so often. One question, then: if Bielsa was so innocent, why did his spies work with such diligence to remain hidden?</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/17/19/8664932-6604397-image-a-31_1547755098954.jpg" height="388" width="634" alt="Marcelo Bielsa has been astonishingly honest over 'Spygate' - but could still face punishment" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Jo's late show is a farce </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What an utter betrayal of tennis that Jo Konta and Garbine Muguruza were made to start their Australian Open second round game at gone midnight on Thursday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What a credit to both players that they delivered one of the matches of the tournament, with just two service breaks separating them across three sets and three hours.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Konta lost and hurried from court close to tears and it was left to Muguruza to sum up the wanton destructiveness of it all.

He picked a three-man defence, with Andres Iniesta the holding midfielder. His right wing-back was Leroy Sane, his left wing-back was Thierry Henry. Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero were in central midfield, so he could accommodate Didier Drogba and Samuel Eto'o up front. Toure is one of those who understands why Paul Pogba would be devastated at being asked to defend. Maybe he'd like to manage Manchester United. Pogba is offering ringing endorsements of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, privately and publicly, now he is free of defensive shackles. His brother Mathias, a third-tier footballer in France, was even more direct.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Martin Samuel - Sport for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-18T02:08:54.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Paul Pogba is not Lionel Messi... he doesn't just get free rein</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-18T02:08:54.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Paul Pogba</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/17/20/8664846-0-image-a-48_1547755361174.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1359898</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Javier Garcia/BPI/REX</mi:licensorName></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6603475/Paul-Pogba-explains-best-world-Man-United.html" title="'A player's individual stats comes with the team... never by yourself': Paul Pogba explains how he can be the best in the world at Manchester United"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6603599/Jose-Mourinho-appears-criticise-Paul-Pogba-Ed-Woodward.html" title="'Coaches need a structure... the manager is not there to keep the discipline at any cost': Jose Mourinho appears to criticise Paul Pogba and Manchester United board as he vows to return to 'top level football'"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6602921/Paul-Pogba-roars-Man-United-training-paternity-leave-260k-bright-yellow-Ferrari.html" title="Paul Pogba roars back to Man United training after paternity leave in £260k bright yellow Ferrari as his team-mates go for their seventh straight win under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer against Brighton"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6602339/Lionel-Messi-reveals-favourite-La-Liga-goal-reaching-400-league.html" title="Lionel Messi has hit 400 goals in La Liga but can you guess the Barcelona great's favourite of all time?"></atom:link></item><item><title>Lee Westwood on course for son's 18th Augusta birthday gift as Englishman enjoys return to form</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-6604965/Westwood-course-sons-18th-Augusta-birthday-gift-Englishman-enjoys-return-form.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jan 2019 22:29:03 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6604965</guid><description><![CDATA[Every father wants to impress his son with something special for an 18th birthday present, and Lee Westwood is well on his way to hitting the jackpot regarding his boy Sam.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="mol-para-with-font">Every father wants to impress his son with something special for an 18th birthday present, and Lee Westwood is well on his way to hitting the jackpot regarding his boy Sam.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For a golf-mad teenager, who will reach that landmark during the Masters in April, does it get much better than caddying for dad at the 83rd edition?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For it to come about, 45-year-old Westwood will have to rise from his current placing of 63rd in the world to inside the top 50 by mid-March.

Since I first spoke out in April 2016 about my experience at British Cycling, significant change has taken place. I firmly believe this change happened, because Athletes brought to light the culture of fear and lack of investment in Athlete welfare that permeated through the British World Class Performance system. I’m happy I was the catalyst for other athletes to speak up and challenge their coaches and organisations, to push for a better and fairer environment in which to excel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m glad that British Cycling, through their own internal, but never published, investigation, confirmed that I had been subjected to discrimination. I’m also glad that through this process they accepted they hadn’t paid sufficient care and attention to the wellbeing of athletes and that the handling of my case had been inept.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m also glad that UK Sport found in their independent investigation that a culture of fear did exist, along with a ‘power pocket’ structure, lack of oversight and people holding positions for which they were unsuitable. A vindication I feel for the true and fair account I gave of my time at British Cycling. When I first spoke out, these organisations said I was wrong and there wasn’t a problem. I’m happy that I and other Athletes could show them otherwise, and enable them to look inwardly at themselves and change their structure, their policies and their personnel. To change so significantly in the past three years can only be proof that a problem originally existed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am disappointed at the judgement, but I have no regrets in going through this process. Despite meetings, mediation and attempts at settlement, it was clear that the only way to engage and ensure change occurred within these organisations was a legal challenge. There is no other option open to Athletes. It took two leading Barristers, a team of eight lawyers, a seven-day tribunal, close to £1million in legal fees and a proclamation that the ‘skies would fall in’ if the system was changed for British Cycling and UK Sport, to answer some simple questions posed by one Athlete about the set-up of the World Class Performance System. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That it required all of this, and that even during the tribunal they struggled to answer simple questions, showed me I was right to push through my concerns and seek clarity, not just for myself, but for all Athletes on the World Class Programme, to ensure that the administrators at these Organisations are as World Class as the Athletes that represent them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’d like to thank the team that supported me, who have worked unpaid for the past three years to help me get to this point. The defence and tactics used against me at times were aggressive, my character was repeatedly called into question, my motives challenged. I was heavily briefed against and my sporting opportunities were lost. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This wasn’t a defence that upheld the Olympic ideals rather one that embraced the win at all costs mentality for which they’d recently been criticized. The irony for me is, right at the beginning of this process, when I met with British Cycling, all I asked for was an apology and commitment to improve Athlete welfare. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Neither were given. I therefore hope that Julie Harrington can reflect on how my situation was handled and ensure that no other Athlete endure the same inept process. Also, with the recent appointment of British Cycling’s first Integrity &amp; Compliance Director, Rod Findlay, I hope he ensures that Athletes have an outlet and process which will allow them to hold British Cycling employees to account for inappropriate behaviour and misuse of personal data.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I hope that Liz Nichol, with the little time she has left in post, doesn’t lose the momentum of this case. Many concerns were raised during this process and I hope she ensures that Athlete welfare is at the forefront of the agenda for the new CEO and planning for the next Olympic cycle. I think it’s vital that UK Sport monitors Governing Bodies more closely moving forwards, ensuring that Athletes have a safe environment in which to thrive and a whistle blowing procedure that protects those brave enough to speak out, to ensure we don’t repeat the mistakes of the past.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’m happy that new information came to light during the tribunal that will aid and inform Athletes moving forwards. UK Sport confirmed that the British Athletes Commission is engaged by UK Sport to negotiate the WCP Athlete Agreement on behalf of Athletes before it’s sent to Governing Bodies. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was unknown to every Athlete I’ve asked, so I will be reaching out to the Commission to see if I can be included in discussions next time around. Secondly, British Cycling confirmed that they are a service provider to Athletes, with appearances for sponsors and partners purely for educational and learning purposes. Again, this was a new way of explaining it to me, and certainly not how it had been explained during my time there, so I hope Athletes and future commercial partners take note of that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has been a long three years, and it has cost me a lot, but as I said earlier, I have no regrets. I hold my head high knowing that I left no stone unturned and always told the truth. In that time, I’ve almost completed my degree in sports &amp; exercise nutrition, set up my own personal training business and am now starting a family. I am excited about the future.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I will be meeting with my legal advisors in the coming weeks to consider grounds for an appeal. I take this process seriously and will not appeal for appeal’s sake.</p>                            </div>                        </div>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>Jess Varnish says she has no regrets after losing her landmark employment case against British Cycling and UK Sport.

like I was playing after having a few beers, which I hadn’t done.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A few minutes later, a more refreshed-looking Lee Westwood finished on the same mark, as the

I control my own destiny.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Khan also denied that Hearn had offered him double the four million dollars he is guaranteed to fight Crawford in New York or Las Vegas to stick with Brook, sayng: 'It was a bit more money but no, not much more.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He added: 'Anyway the Kell fight will still be there even if, God forbid, it goes wrong for me against Crawford. Not that I think that will happen. I know a lot of people are saying I've got no chance against someone as good as Terence but I firmly believe I will be the first man to beat him and take his place in the pound-for-pound rankings.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/15/19/8564140-0-image-a-12_1547579194051.jpg" height="384" width="634" alt="Khan went for Crawford instead of a long-awaited Battle of Britain against Kell Brook" /><video preload="none" id="1717126" title="Amir Khan reveals he goes six weeks without sex before a fight" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/28/22/4DBD22BD00000578-0-image-a-2_1530221448725.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2018/06/28/7423335136993559068/1024x576_MP4_7423335136993559068.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So it is Brook who had better make sure he doesn't lose in the meantime.' At 32, Khan admits: 'I'm coming into the last chapter of my career.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As such, he can envisage Crawford and either Brook or the legendary Manny Pacquiao being his opponents 'for my last two fights.' That suggests that if he does shock Crawford, a world title unification showdown with Pacquiao would take precedence over boxing Brook, meaning that fight may never happen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Furthermore, the fight against Crawford is the last in his three-fight deal with Hearn, who also promotes Brook.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm not saying I won't do more fights with Eddie,' says Khan. 'He's been good to me so why not? But fortunately I'm not one of the many fighters who have to do what their promoters tell them. I control my own destiny.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They also played the comparison game at the London media event.

I believe it's my time to do the same.' Khan and Crawford expressed their admiration for each other.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Khan: 'Without doubt Terence is one of the best technical boxers in the world today.' Crawford: 'Amir is still one of the fastest punchers and most naturally talented boxers in the game. That makes him very dangerous even though he has been knocked out a couple of times.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The only minor frisson came when Crawford declined to rank Khan among the top five welterweights in the world. After some musing he said: 'Maybe in the top five or six. This division is stacked with excellent fighters.' </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/15/13/8549432-6594175-image-a-37_1547559192820.jpg" height="500" width="634" alt="Khan was in talks to face rival Brook but instead opted to face pound-for-pound star Crawford" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Khan came back: 'I hope he believes that. Although he's undefeated I've seen him hurt in fights where he's taken opponents lightly. If he thinks I'm past my best it will make it easier for me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm not going to America as the opponent. Terence will be one of the most skilled boxers I've fought but he's not that good that beating him would be the crowning moment of my career.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Despite my two world titles and the size of this challenge the greatest achievement is still my Olympic silver medal. That changed my life and made me a household name around the world, overnight.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Khan v Crawford will be on ESPN pay-per-view in the US but Arum is still reviewing bids for the UK television rights.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says: 'There is huge interest in boxing over here and we will choose from one of several excellent TV outlets in Britain in the next few days.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Presumably that includes Sky, BT Sports and ITV.

Assuming Bruce does not break away from family commitments to start his new job early, he will at least be able to watch it live on the BBC, along with those Owls fans not able to sort out travel to and from the capital for a 6pm kick-off on a Sunday evening.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Matt Barlow for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-15T22:59:38.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Luton 0-1 Sheffield Wednesday: Atdhe Nuhiu fires his side through</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-15T22:59:38.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/15/21/8571378-0-image-a-74_1547588160785.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6595173/FA-Cup-round-replays-LIVE-Blackburn-vs-Newcastle-Luton-vs-Sheffield-Wednesday-more.html" title="FA Cup third round replays, LIVE scores – Latest updates from Blackburn vs Newcastle, Stoke vs Shrewsbury and Luton vs Sheffield Wednesday"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6594249/Ralph-Hasenhuttl-happy-FA-Cup-clears-Southampton-suspensions.html" title="'That's the most positive thing from this': Ralph Hasenhuttl happy as FA Cup third round replay clears suspensions for key Southampton trio"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6592097/We-hope-change-landscape-club-town-Luton-Town-face-defining-month.html" title="'We hope it will change the landscape of the club and the town': Luton Town face defining month ahead of an FA Cup fourth round replay, a League One promotion race and significant developments over a new stadium"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6589689/Benitez-admits-risk-Premier-League-status-prioritising-cup-run-season.html" title="'Who has a realistic chance?

We will carry on relentlessly. We will get a new manager and kick on again. The club is in great shape. It's owned by the fans which is amazing. It is in a good place at the moment and that hasn't always been the case.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'At any club, you're going to have times when you suffer but Luton Town fans have been on the biggest rollercoaster with all the ups and downs, what's gone on with the stadium and the 30-point deduction and relegation from the Football League.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'In the year we went down from League Two, we were in the same division Bournemouth and they're established in the Premier League. It's a big call but why can't we go on to do the same? Why not?'</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/15/00/8528358-6592097-image-a-94_1547512241531.jpg" height="498" width="634" alt="A draw against promotion rivals Sunderland could be vital come the final stages of the season" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/15/00/8528138-0-image-a-78_1547511554110.jpg" height="432" width="634" alt="Having led them to League One, Nathan Jones was poached by Stoke City in January" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">More than 100 applications for the manager's job have been received, hard evidence if required that Luton is an attractive proposition once again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are upwardly mobile having spent five years outside the Football League (EFL) when they were relegated a decade ago, with Harford the manager who was unable to produce the miracle required to defy a 30-point penalty imposed by football authorities for administrative irregularities.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">John Still led them back up in 2014 and they moved into a smart new training ground near Luton Airport in 2017 before Jones won promotion last year to League One where they lie second behind Portsmouth, who are the visitors at Kenilworth Road on January 29.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harford did not expect to be back in the dug-out - nor does he want the role on a permanent basis - but football's wicked sense of timing has seen him take charge for Saturday's 1-1 draw against his beloved Sunderland and an FA Cup replay with a chance to face another of his former clubs in the next round at Stamford Bridge.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/15/00/8527350-0-image-a-79_1547511609500.jpg" height="437" width="634" alt="A fourth-round FA CUp clash with David Luiz's Chelsea awaits if Luton can beat Sunderland" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Weird, isn't it?' said Harford. 'I love the FA Cup. I've always had an affinity with it, ever since Sunderland won it in 1973. I was there as a fan at Hillsborough for the semi-final against Arsenal and I was at Wembley for the final against Leeds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'That save by Jim Montgomery still puts the hairs up on the back of my neck.. I lived on the road into the city centre and the team came right past my house as they brought the Cup home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I ran after the bus for two miles, all the way to Roker Park, and I went inside the stadium and Bob Stokoe and the players carried the Cup out onto the pitch. I played and lost in two semi-finals but that's my greatest memory of being a Sunderland fan.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the age of 59, Harford also has Luton Town stitched into his heart. He feels as if he owes the club because he took them into non-league but no-one else around the place seems to feel that way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His talent, endeavour and commitment in various roles over the years are valued and appreciated by all, especially those travelling fans who stood to salute him at the Stadium of Light on Saturday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harford will savour the atmosphere against Sheffield Wednesday and there is no-one better placed to lead Luton through this vital period when eye-catching fixtures on the pitch and the search for a manager are eclipsed by what might happen in the committee rooms of Luton Borough Council?</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/15/00/8528262-0-image-a-77_1547511499763.jpg" height="391" width="634" alt="The club are facing two critical planning meetings as they plan to leave Kenilworth Road" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first of them, on Wednesday, will hear proposals for to build a new 17,500-capacity stadium at Power Court in the town centre, which is recommended for approval by planners.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The second, two weeks later, is for a mixed development of office, retail and leisure facilities at Newlands Park, on land owned by the club, near Junction 10 of the M1, which would in theory fund Power Court.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For more than 60 years, Luton have been exploring ways to leave the lop-sided charm of Kenilworth Road, their home since 1905, in the name of progress. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finally, they are close to a deal and the tension and sense of what-might-be is palpable.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/15/00/8528272-6592097-image-a-92_1547512197007.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The charming old ground has been their home since 1905 but the time has come to move on" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We have two fixtures greater than the FA Cup final in 1959 and the Littlewoods Cup final victory over Arsenal in 1988,' said chief executive Gary Sweet. 'I don't say that light-heartedly because I was present at the last final.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It is the biggest month in the history of Luton Town and one that we hope will change the landscape of the club and the town. We feel a bond with the town, and it just so happens that as we rise the town does, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There's always been a remarkable synchronicity and this time we're determined to make sure that the rise will be permanent.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>MATT BARLOW: The biggest month in the 134-year history of Luton Town just keeps getting bigger.

who only lost the Athens 2014 final to a Cuban legend - and a two-time world champion, it seems Khan cannot win.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While he is expected to be paid $4million for risking his well-being against Crawford, he might have pocketed twice as much for fighting Brook.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the decision he has taken is completely in character with a true fighter who has always chased the glory more than the money. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Khan jeopardised his career and compromised his earnings by waiting in vain for mega-fights against Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao which he had not only chased, by offering to take the thin end of the deals, but been promised.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/14/20/8519124-0-image-a-63_1547496166212.jpg" height="385" width="634" alt="Khan accepted a dangerous step up two divisions for a super-fight against Canelo Alvarez " /><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the first real chance of a starry super-fight in Las Vegas finally materialised, it required him to accept a dangerous step up by two weight divisions to face Canelo Alvarez. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He out-boxed the Mexican legend for five-and-a-half rounds before being KO'd by a massive right hook from the heavier, stronger man.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For his bravery, he was mocked as a chinless wonder.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, courage undiminished and self-belief unbowed, Khan is daring to venture into the lion's den again. This time against Crawford, the undefeated world welterweight champion who is seen by many as the natural heir to Mayweather's throne.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Far from knocking Khan we should be celebrating a sportsman who has never given us a dull moment, let alone a boring fight. Especially the connoisseurs of the prize-ring.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/14/20/8519132-6591383-image-a-64_1547497566136.jpg" height="364" width="634" alt="Despite out-boxing the more powerful Mexican, Khan was knocked out in the sixth round" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Furthermore, the clichéd notion of British boxing fans being distraught about him keeping the Brook fight on the back-burner is rather far-fetched.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A couple of years ago, maybe.

Think of Erik Compton, who made it to the PGA Tour despite two heart transplants. Or Patrick Cantlay, who cradled his best friend while his life ebbed away following a hit-and-run, and went on to become one of the world’s best players in his memory.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Derek Lawrenson for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-14T22:33:49.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Rags-to-riches Rodriguez living the dream after earning PGA tour spot</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-14T22:33:49.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/14/20/8521032-0-image-a-44_1547499597626.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1147327</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Getty Images</mi:licensorName></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-6587567/Major-tests-Tigers-quest-10-2019-golf-dates-look-forward-to.html" title="Major tests, Tiger's quest and a Crosby tune in 2019 - 10 golf dates to look forward to this year"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-6582741/Andy-Murray-reveals-cruel-moment-Miami-knew-over.html" title="Andy Murray reveals the cruel moment in Miami last month he knew it was over: 'I had tears in my eyes...

If this really is the end, he may well miss playing too much to be constantly reminded of it. But one day that will change.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nobody who gave as much to a sport as Murray can ever be truly free of it. Meaning, this isn't over.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At least it shouldn't be. Is there anyone better to lead from the front at the Lawn Tennis Association than the man who carried British tennis on his shoulders?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Is there anyone who knows more about the development of young talent, the pathways, the pressures of competition, than Murray, who came from nowhere to be No 1 in the world?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After Great Britain won the Davis Cup in 2015, it was Murray who set the agenda at an excoriating press conference, in which the failings of the LTA were laid bare. He certainly seemed to know what was wrong then, he has certainly sounded, in many conversations across many years, as if he had clear ideas for reform.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/14/20/8520318-6591413-image-a-22_1547498552712.jpg" height="435" width="634" alt="Murray was knocked out of the Australian Open on Monday by Roberto Bautista Agut" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Do you know that in Spain, at 18, your funding stops?' he told me in 2011, before he won the first of three Grand Slams.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'From there, you get nothing that you cannot earn for yourself. We're funding guys to 27, 28 — while in the most successful tennis nation in the world you're basically on your own.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When I went to Spain, from the best players to the worst players, we were all taught the same way, all given the same drills. They had a structure and stuck to it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Go to our national centre and you've got 10 different nationalities all coaching in different ways. If we don't get results straight away, we panic and change direction.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There is no confidence in our technique, no sense of sticking to an idea, no identity, no consistency in the way we teach tennis, so naturally there is no British style.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We'll get lucky every now and then and one might come through, but there is no form to our teaching, which is why we have no depth. To be among the best tennis playing nations in the world you must have identity.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was when the National Tennis Centre was still operating as a base for elite sport. The LTA abandoned it in 2014 and there have been many more changes of strategy since. It underlines Murray's point. No consistency.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/14/20/8520320-6591413-image-a-21_1547498543288.jpg" height="417" width="634" alt="Is there anyone better to lead at the LTA than man who carried British tennis on his shoulders?" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Performance directors come and go. Plans are rolled out, then abandoned.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Murray's rise to the summit should have promoted an explosion in participation and interest, as happened in Sweden after Bjorn Borg, but the opposite was true.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tennis participation numbers fell during the time Murray was at his peak. Between 2007 and 2016, Sport England say tennis lost 59,000 players.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is, however, not too late. There is a man, maybe a family, who know a thing or two about producing world-class tennis players, or just engaging young people to play.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Murray needs to get the golf, and the rest of it, out of his system first. Then he might once again be Britain's No 1.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Karanka has the last laugh</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aitor Karanka decided not to wait to be sacked by Nottingham Forest and it is a lovely irony that by the time he decided to walk, the owner, Evangelos Marinakis, was asking him to stay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For weeks, Karanka had lived under threat of the sack, so he flipped the scenario and gave Marinakis the brush-off instead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Forest began their Karanka-less reign with a 2-0 defeat and two men sent off at lowly Reading.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some might even call that a happy ending.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/14/20/8520376-6591413-image-a-23_1547498592211.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="For weeks, manager Aitor Karanka had lived under threat of the sack at Nottingham Forest" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>The only way is ethics, Bielsa</strong></strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Spying on opponents cannot be all that common if Frank Lampard is angered by it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a player, in senior football, Lampard worked under 15 coaches, not including caretakers. He had a lot of opportunity to experience varied working practices.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If it was normal to hang around the opposition training ground with a set of bolt-cutters and a periscope, he would no doubt have been rather relaxed about what Marcelo Bielsa was doing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The fact Lampard greeted his Leeds counterpart on the touchline with a face like thunder, after spying on Derby's training sessions had been exposed, suggests otherwise — and no amount of explanation around cultural differences makes it any less reprehensible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bielsa's supporters favour equivalency. And yes, teams gain any advantage possible, we know that. Jose Mourinho used training-ground spies at Chelsea, and Lampard would have benefited from this gleaned knowledge. Yet that does not mean he knew or approved of the tactic. There were plenty of journalists at the News of the World who didn't have a clue about phone hacking.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/14/20/8520414-6591413-image-a-24_1547498624605.jpg" height="448" width="634" alt="Leeds manager Marcelo Bielsa was caught up in a spying storm ahead of their clash with Derby" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Arsene Wenger said one of the reasons he did not socialise with managers after matches is he did not want to become friends with his rivals and be compromised by an old chum ringing him up in the days before they played, trying to find out his team. It happens. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One manager, who was good friends with Ron Atkinson, found himself in crisis towards the end of a season. He called Atkinson to see what he intended when Aston Villa visited on Saturday. Atkinson obliged, going through the starting XI name by name, finally getting to Tony Daley. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Oh, that's bad,' said the boss. 'Our full-back's a young kid. Daley will murder him.' 'Don't worry,' Atkinson assured him. 'He's only good for one game in three…' 'Yes, but that's too much for us.' '…And he's just played it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Players talk to old friends, to agents, who often have a foot in both camps. Information leaks that way, too. It still isn't the same as spying.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There may be no rule against it, but there is at least an ethical understanding between clubs. It is this Bielsa has broken, the sense of fair play that should underpin the way clubs behave towards one another.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no rule to preserve it — but, really, there shouldn't have to be.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Rashford revival proves Jose got him all wrong</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no doubt Jose Mourinho was let down very badly by some of his Manchester United players. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, equally, it can be no coincidence that Marcus Rashford is in fine form, playing in his best position, under a manager who does not turn to the crowd and scowl each time he misses a chance. He's 21. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What did Mourinho not understand about that?</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/14/20/8520436-6591413-image-a-25_1547498668841.jpg" height="642" width="634" alt="Marcus Rashford scored the winner as Manchester United overcame Tottenham on Sunday" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Southgate has to resist the lure of United</strong></strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The last, the only, England manager to renege on his contract for what he considered to be a better job was Don Revie and history has not been kind. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is understandable if Gareth Southgate is under consideration at Manchester United, but he would not be afforded wider sympathy if he encouraged their advances. Revie became a pariah after walking out on England to manage the United Arab Emirates, and Southgate would not be quickly forgiven, even if his destination was closer to home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Manchester United are a great club and managing them is a great opportunity. Yet so is taking England to what amounts to a home tournament, Euro 2020.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Southgate's handling of this young England team has converted cynics and earned him newfound respect, but the public can turn just as quickly if they feel misled. United supporters may consider their club bigger than England. The rest of the country does not.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And Southgate would be letting his players down if he dumped England for club football in tournament year. His fine words would appear hollow, the bond he has forged with this young, ambitious group exposed as a sham. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/14/20/8520450-6591413-image-a-26_1547498691055.jpg" height="395" width="634" alt="It is understandable if Gareth Southgate is under consideration at Manchester United" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Southgate would depart with his backroom staff, most importantly first-team coach Steve Holland, and that would leave the FA high and dry with no obvious successor. No matter the positives of recent campaigns, it would be back to square one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, football is a fickle industry. Southgate, like all managers, would be jettisoned if he failed. Yet, to this point, the FA have been very good to him. They showed faith and offered an opportunity when clubs of Manchester United's stature did not want to know. They bought into his ideas, his philosophy, helped build his rebooted England with smart communications strategies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They have stayed loyal to his predecessors, such as Roy Hodgson, in adversity, too. One imagines, even if Southgate could not repeat his last-four World Cup finish in 2020, the FA would remain supportive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nothing deserves desertion, or even drama, and if Southgate is half the man he is imagined to be, he will not consider testing them this way.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Hennessey's no </strong></strong><strong><strong>Nazi, just a fool</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Roy Hodgson aside, nobody believes Wayne Hennessey's explanation for his strange appearance in the photograph posted by his Crystal Palace team-mate, Max Meyer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The image showed the Palace players on a night out — with Hennessey in the background, right arm out straight, the fingers of his left hand across his top lip. Meyer is German. Think Basil Fawlty.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meyer clearly hadn't noticed when he put the picture on Instagram or, if he had, didn't care. Once the image went viral however, the FA came under pressure to investigate and knee-jerked into action.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what is Hennessey accused of? Being a Nazi? He plainly isn't. Making a provocative, racist gesture? It clearly wasn't intended.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/14/21/8242920-6591413-Wayne_Hennessey_appeared_to_make_an_offensive_gesture_in_a_photo-a-33_1547501832088.jpg" height="880" width="631" alt="Wayne Hennessey appeared to make an offensive gesture in a photo during a team night out" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">If we laughingly dismiss his explanation — that he was waving at the cameraman and shouting at him to get on with it, cupping his mouth to make the sound carry — then his worst crime is a public display in bad taste. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not ideal, but not a capital offence and unless Meyer or anyone present is genuinely offended, not the FA's business, either.

Yet how often do Chelsea utilise these strengths? How often do they get bogged down in central midfield, all signs pointing to Jorginho, who is frequently turned back towards his goal by the congestion?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was loudly booed by the home crowd against Newcastle, and as teams prepare more thoroughly for Sarri-ball, is finding it harder to operate. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The lack of a clinical striker is Chelsea's main problem, but the passivity of the forward play is not far behind. No team that includes Pedro, Willian and Eden Hazard should want for goals and Luiz showed what could be done, set free from the restraints of the system.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Arsenal have spent the last year reorganising their executive support staff.

But what can you do? Some people are idiots. This was an absolute heroic display from <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/andy_murray/index.html" id="mol-8150ddb0-1833-11e9-a31b-35653f7aef5d" class="class">Andy Murray</a>. If it was his last game of professional tennis, it was imbued with heroism. If he retires tomorrow, he leaves a hero.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There, said it. Murray is as near as a man can get to inspiring hero-worship, without donning a cape, or bending tracks to divert a runaway train from striking an orphanage. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At one stage it appeared we were about to witness one of the most remarkable comebacks in tennis history but instead had to settle for heroic defeat, as Murray's body chased him down the way he had chased down Roberto Bautista Agut, across a match that went into its fifth hour.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/14/21/8521564-6591227-image-m-2_1547500566740.jpg" height="467" width="634" alt="" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/14/19/8518054-0-image-a-48_1547493723648.jpg" height="475" width="634" alt="The former world No 1 came back from two sets down as he put in a heroic effort in Melbourne  " /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bautista Agut is one of the world's form players right now – <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/novak_djokovic/index.html" id="mol-815179f0-1833-11e9-a31b-35653f7aef5d">Novak Djokovic</a> was a recent scalp, in Doha – and when he went two sets up it looked as if Murray was to bow out with dignity, but pretty much as expected. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Australian hosts had prepared a tribute montage to be shown on the big screens around Margaret Court Arena, and many of Murray's rivals and colleagues had contributed. The tournament director was no doubt getting ready to roll it. But Murray had other ideas.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From there, he won two tiebreak sets to return the match to 2-2, then held serve to lead the fifth set 1-0. He was ahead for the first time since the seventh game. The player who had talked about this as potentially his farewell was closing in on an outcome as baffling, as it would be brilliant. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By now, the crowd were spending as much time on their feet as in their seats, including the various members of family and team Murray that were gathered in the players' box. Impassive no more, they were willing him on. They would have known he was in pain, but also that this was his choice. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/14/19/8518056-0-image-a-51_1547493739801.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="From a euphoric rolling back of the years, reality came barging through the door in set five " /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/14/21/8521614-6591227-image-a-10_1547500658134.jpg" height="343" width="634" alt="" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He wouldn't rather be anywhere else. The hip that had seemed as insurmountable an obstacle as Rafa Nadal on clay, seemed to have been dispatched like a poor second serve. This was happening. This was really happening.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And then it wasn't. From a euphoric rolling back of the years, reality came barging through the door like a gang of drunken gatecrashers at a nerdy teenager's birthday party. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The set began to slip from Murray – 1-1, 2-1, 3-1, 4-1 – and as it did no doubt his thoughts turned to the end. Not just the end of his career and the pain that was precipitating it, because that is an anguish he lives with daily, but the end of this match. How would he handle that? How could he keep his emotions in check? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There would be an interview, and the same questions that he has been fielding for months, except this time they would need answering in a way that gave closure. And Murray, plainly, was not ready for closure. Not just yet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So as the match moved into hour five, at 5-1 down, he held his racket up to the crowd, who were cheering now, in anticipation of seeing the last game of tennis of his professional career. He looked a little moist around the eyes, as did his mother, Judy. He puffed out his cheeks, and fought to keep it all together.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/14/19/8518028-0-image-a-52_1547493744798.jpg" height="417" width="634" alt="Even though he was down 5-1 in the final set, Murray still stubbornly held serve in the next " /><p class="mol-para-with-font">And then he held serve.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He does that, Murray. He has a way of making each fresh round an ordeal, often an emotional one. You strap yourself in for the long haul when you watch him. It was no different on Monday. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those who tuned in shortly after 7am UK time and were envisaging getting on with their day soonest, would have found themselves somewhat exasperated to still be sitting on the sofa at close to noon. It was ever thus. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Matches that appear won turn into epic encounters; lost causes are unexpectedly salvaged. Nothing is easy. Everything takes time, demands investment. Even this. Even a foregone conclusion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here was a man with a decaying hip, who was supposed to be adapting his game to make the rallies as short as possible.  And yet, hour five and we're still engaged. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/14/19/8518052-0-image-m-56_1547493767624.jpg" height="437" width="634" alt="Britain's Murray has a way of making each fresh round an ordeal, often an emotional one" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hour five and he's challenging a call at 5-2 and 15-0 down, when every pain receptor in his body must have his brain on speed dial and is hitting the call button on repeat. Credit to Bautista Agut who by this stage might have felt inclined to just hop over the net and reason with him, make him see sense. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, the Spaniard closed out the game, and then spoke generously of his opponent, showing no impatience that his own victory was largely sidelined. His impassiveness throughout was its own tribute, too, always treating Murray as a opponent who needed to be beaten, not one that should be. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, a player with less mental strength may even have succumbed when Murray fought back. When a player whose body is no longer fit for purpose suddenly finds the athletic resolve to engage in a 23 shot rally, and win the point, it can mess with the head.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2016, when Murray ascended to the height of world number one by beating Novak Djokovic in London, the event began, mysteriously, with a reading of a poem by Dylan Thomas. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/14/19/8518022-0-image-a-54_1547493752130.jpg" height="452" width="634" alt="In glimpses we still saw the younger, fitter man - the ball coming back when it should not " /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Do not go gentle into that good night / Old age should burn and rave at close of day / Rage, rage against the dying of the light…' And here was Murray, little more than two years later, doing just that. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Raging against the dying of his light, his incredible talent, burning and raving, despite the disadvantages, the injustice of it all, his body giving up in a way his spirit never did. In glimpses we still saw the younger, fitter man. The ball coming back when it should not, the anticipation, the early takes. And the strategies, of course. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That hasn't deserted him: arguably the sharpest mind in tennis. The player who overcame more naturally gifted players, because he made plans, and set traps. Bautista Agut had never taken a set off him before Monday and, one imagines, had Murray remained fit that record would have remained intact. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Until the final set, the biggest winning margin between the players was a single break. Murray was still finding ways to overcome his limitations, right until the end.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If it is, after all, the end. No doubt buoyed by the unexpected closeness of this encounter, Murray spoke as if he may take one final swing at saving his career with a major hip operation. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/14/19/8518058-0-image-a-50_1547493731832.jpg" height="433" width="634" alt="Murray spoke as if he may take one final swing at saving his career with a major hip operation " /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The tournament organiser went ahead and showed the montage of his best moments anyway. There is no guarantee extensive surgery will preserve anything more than his quality of life, and Murray's doctor has done little to encourage optimism in recent days. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But we believe in Murray, the way we still believe in heroes, and because he so often delivers the amazing. He may have ached like a man who was giving up, but he didn't play like one. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He burned and raved and raged in a way that made us miss him more than ever, if this is his last. And even in defeat, he went out a hero: because in Andy Murray, we most certainly have one. </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>MARTIN SAMUEL - CHIEF SPORTS WRITER: Some people get quite upset when the word heroic is used in connection with athletic performance. But what can you do? Some people are idiots. This was an absolute heroic display from Andy Murray. If it was his last game of professional tennis, it was imbued with heroism. If he retires tomorrow, he leaves a hero. There, said it. Murray is as near as a man can get to inspiring hero-worship, without donning a cape, or bending tracks to divert a runaway train from striking an orphanage.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Martin Samuel - Sport for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-14T21:23:44.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Andy Murray was a hero raging against the dying of his light</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-14T21:23:44.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Andy Murray</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/14/21/8521564-0-image-a-7_1547500643592.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1000161</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>AFP/Getty Images</mi:licensorName></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-6589809/Roger-Federer-Rafa-Nadal-Novak-Djokovic-lead-tributes-Andy-Murray-Australian-Open.html" title="'Just know that I am your biggest fan': Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic lead tributes for Andy Murray in emotionally-charged montage shown to beaten Murray on court in front of packed crowd’"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-6590025/Judy-Murray-quotes-Henry-V-posts-mock-image-son-Andy-Australian-Open-defeat.html" title="'Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more': Judy Murray quotes Henry V as she posts mock-up image of son Andy after Australian Open defeat to Roberto Bautista Agut  "></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-6589117/Andy-Murray-vows-possible-make-return-Australian-Open.html" title="'Maybe I will see you again...

The bid, from Shanghai SIPG, is nowhere near the £35m reported. It is €31m, which works out at £27.6m. It is the salary that is bewitching: in the region of £300,000 a week, West Ham have been told.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, let's put that into perspective. Say Real Madrid came in for Harry Kane and offered him £300,000 a week to sign. Maybe that would be appealing. And then they went to Daniel Levy with their offer to Tottenham: £27.6m. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That would be a very short conversation, and understandably so; upwards of £14m a year is not the wage of a £27.6m footballer. Not even the wage of one costing £35m.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Arnautovic seems to believe that because it is a good deal for him, it is a good deal for everybody. It isn't. He believes that because he wants to go, he is owed. He is not.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Still, at least one of his instincts is being borne out.  Arnautovic has always thought he was a footballer capable of performing for an elite club and, on Saturday — alone among the West Ham side — he looked as if he could play for Arsenal. And if he thinks that is a compliment, it's not.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/20/8473980-0-Arnautovic_thinks_highly_of_himself_but_was_the_poorest_performe-m-59_1547411637686.jpg" height="574" width="634" alt="Arnautovic thinks highly of himself but was the poorest performer on the pitch for West Ham" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>MARTIN SAMUEL - THE VERDICT: Marko Arnautovic turned to all sides of the London Stadium and applauded.

The Open, Royal Portrush (July 18-21)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 68-year wait for the return of the game's oldest event to Northern Ireland is blessedly almost over. Get ready to swoon as the camera gorges eagerly on the stupendous views, as one of the UK's top three courses basks in the spotlight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All you need to know about the sort of welcome that is in store on the Antrim coastline, is that this will be the first all-ticket Open — and it sold out in minutes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">3.

Tour Championship, East Lake (August 22-25)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The three-event FedEx Cup will now dominate August, with the bonus claimed by Justin Rose last year increased from $10million to a still more staggering $15m. Let's hope the climax is half as good as in 2018, when Woods won the final event.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">9. Players Championship, sawgrass (March 14-17)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The PGA Tour's flagship event moves from May, when the ground was hard and the event was claimed by some decidedly obscure names.

Walker Cup, Royal Liverpool (Sept 7-8)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like the Ryder Cup, this amateur equivalent played between teams from Britain and Ireland and America has been dominated by the home side in recent editions, with no away wins since 2007.

His strength was being the anti-Mourinho, the man who brought the simplistic fun and flair back to <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html">Manchester United's</a> football. He was probably going to be found out by the first handy team he played.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what are we to make of this, the game that takes his flawless run to six matches across all competitions, the best start of any Manchester United manager? What are we to make of a victory at the home of a team that many considered title contenders, against the manager many think should be king of Old Trafford next season, Mauricio Pochettino? What are we to make when <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html">Tottenham</a> had so comprehensively outplayed Manchester United, and the manager once considered the game's master tactician, earlier in the season?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was a side of Solskjaer as yet unseen. Savvy, smart, calculating, yet not negative. He needed an exceptional performance from goalkeeper <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/sport/david-de-gea/index.html">David De Gea</a> to help him on his way, but there's no shame in that, either. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/17/8469346-6586853-image-a-24_1547400012292.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Marcus Rashford breaks the deadlock for  United as he took full advantage of a quick counter attack before the beak" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/17/8469616-6586853-image-a-36_1547401020889.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Tottenham captain Hugo Lloris was unable to keep Rashford's shot out despite getting a hand to the ball" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/17/8469344-6586853-image-a-26_1547400015885.jpg" height="644" width="962" alt="The 21-year-old celebrates scoring the opening goal for the visitors as United went into half-time with a 1-0 lead" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/17/8469348-6586853-image-a-28_1547400018868.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="The young England striker jumps for joy after scoring the opening goal against Tottenham at Wembley" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/17/8469526-6586853-image-a-34_1547400667321.jpg" height="687" width="962" alt="Ashley Young and Jesse Lingard celebrate with Rashford after breaking the deadlock for the Red Devils" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/18/8471048-6586853-image-a-65_1547404775511.jpg" height="645" width="962" alt="Ole Gunnar Solskjaer celebrates at full time after winning his first six games as Manchester United manager" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/22/8477052-6586853-image-a-70_1547417873793.jpg" height="433" width="962" alt="" /><video preload="none" id="1840576" title="Ole Gunnar Solskjaer praises &amp;#39;best goalkeeper in the world&amp;#39; David de Gea" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/22/8477236-0-image-a-2_1547417949111.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/01/13/7744764765467394844/1024x576_MP4_7744764765467394844.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><div class="art-ins mol-factbox sport" data-version="2" id="mol-1f9fe570-1761-11e9-b7c4-e963290241e9">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title"><strong><span class="mol-style-small"></span></strong><span class="mol-style-smaller mol-style-small">MATCH FACTS, LEAGUE TABLE, PLAYER RATINGS AND MATCH ZONE</span><strong><span class="mol-style-small"></span></strong></h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                            <div class="cleared row mol-cols mol-cols-3" id="mol-1fa27d80-1761-11e9-b7c4-e963290241e9">                            <div class="mol-col span4 mol-col-1">                                <div class="cleared mol-col-content">                                    <p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>TOTTENHAM (4-3-1-2):</strong> Lloris 7; Trippier 5, Alderweireld 6.5, Vertonghen 6, Davies 5.5; Winks 6.5 (Llorente 81, 5.5), Sissoko 6.5 (Lamela 43, 6), Eriksen 6; Alli 7; Son 6, Kane 7</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>SUBS NOT USED:</strong> Gazzaniga, Rose, Sanchez, Foyth, Skipp<strong> </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>BOOKED:</strong> Alli 50</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>COACH:</strong> Mauricio Pochettino 7</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MANCHESTER UNITED (4-3-3):</strong> De Gea 9; Young 7.5, Lindelof 7, Jones 6.5, Shaw 6; Ander Herrera 8.5, Matic 7.5, Pogba 7.5 (McTominay 90+2); Lingard 7 (Dalot 83), Martial 6.5 (Lukaku 73, 6); Rashford 8 </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>SUBS NOT USED:</strong> Romero, Mata, Andreas Pereira, Fred </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>GOAL:</strong> Rashford 44</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>BOOKED:</strong> Herrera 66, Pogba 78</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>COACH:</strong> Ole Gunnar Solskjaer 8</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>REFEREE:</strong> Mike Dean 7</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MAN OF THE MATCH:</strong> David de Gea</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>VENUE:</strong> Wembley Stadium</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>ATTENDANCE:</strong> 80,062</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Ratings by Jack Gaughan </span></p></div>                            </div><div class="mol-col span4 mol-col-2"> <div class="cleared mol-col-content"> <img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/17/8469402-6586853-image-m-32_1547400229279.jpg" height="553" width="296" alt="" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Marcus Rashford (No 10) finishes on the break after a fantastic pass found him from Paul Pogba.

Most would say Tottenham are a better team than Manchester United right now, so chalk this down as a tactical triumph, too – and one-nil to Solskjaer in his head-to-head reckoning with Pochettino.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Both managers denied that this match was a public audition for the vacancy left by Jose Mourinho, but if results like this do not matter to United's hierarchy, what does? Solskjaer quite literally cannot do better than this sequence and if this was billed as his first big test, the scoreline confirms he surely passed it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The word is that Manchester United's players are very keen on him getting the job permanently, too, and if this is true they are going the right way about it. As the seconds ticked down, red shirts threw themselves into blocks and tackles, and the locals despaired of finding a way past De Gea even if they broke the line protecting him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Imagine what Manchester United's goalkeeper would be like if he was allowed to use his upper limbs. This was another of those performances in which he appeared to have forgotten handling was allowed so went for everything feet first. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/22/8475300-6586853-image-a-71_1547417883082.jpg" height="712" width="962" alt="" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/18/8470720-6586853-image-a-57_1547404023544.jpg" height="636" width="962" alt="David de Gea put in a man of the match performance to keep a clean sheet for Manchester United at Wembley" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/18/8470716-6586853-image-a-62_1547404325922.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Kane stretches to reach a Dele Alli pass in the dying seconds but is unable to connect as Spurs are beaten at home" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/17/8469862-6586853-image-a-40_1547401935675.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="United goalkeeper De Gea had a busy afternoon keeping the Spurs attackers out in their Premier League clash" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/17/8469858-6586853-image-a-43_1547402013583.jpg" height="513" width="962" alt="The Spaniard was forced to save a Kane header as the hosts tried time and time again on Sunday afternoon" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/18/8470656-6586853-image-a-53_1547403882161.jpg" height="636" width="962" alt="Fernando Llorente's tame shot failed to trouble De Gea late on in the game as United held on to all three points" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/17/8469974-6586853-image-a-45_1547402290658.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Christian Eriksen watches his free kick sail just wide of De Gea's post as Spurs continued to threaten United's goal" /><video preload="none" id="1840574" title="Pochettino &amp;#39;so happy&amp;#39; with Tottenham performance despite defeat" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/22/8477226-0-image-a-2_1547417944005.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/01/13/4055862887275017964/1024x576_MP4_4055862887275017964.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was aided by some poor finishing from Tottenham, mind, some of the shots hitting him as much as being saved.

The stadium had almost emptied by then, save for the corner where United's players celebrated with their fans. Kane looked in genuine pain. Without him, and Son, Tottenham's season could unravel quite alarmingly. Pochettino said it would be a massive blow if he was out for long. United's equivalent, no doubt, would be losing De Gea. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/17/8469072-6586853-image-a-17_1547399439062.jpg" height="602" width="962" alt="Dele Alli collects a cross before passing it across the face of the United goal to team mate Kane in the goalmouth" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/17/8469074-6586853-image-a-19_1547399441802.jpg" height="650" width="962" alt="The Tottenham talisman put the ball into the back of the net but his effort was correctly ruled out for offside" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/17/8469056-6586853-image-a-14_1547399424158.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="David de Gea dives to reach the ball but Kane tucks it in before being ruled out for offside in the first half at Wembley" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You're allowed to have a good goalkeeper,' deadpanned Solskjaer after the game, and it's a fair point. Jurgen Klopp went in search of one after the Champions League final, Pep Guardiola rewrote the record books once he had one after his first season at Manchester City and Chelsea broke the world record for one after losing Thibaut Courtois last season. Don't forget, Mourinho had one, too – he had De Gea – and he wasn't getting results like Solskjaer towards the end at Manchester United.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tottenham did not have a shot on target in the first-half, then peppered United's goal like a drunken paintball party in the second. Each time, De Gea was equal to it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Who did he save from? Who didn't he save from? Kane's feet, Dele Alli's head, Kane's head, Alli's feet, Toby Alderweireld at the near post, Fernando Llorente from eight yards, Kane from a free-kick, Alli again, and Kane once more. Yet if the sheer weight of chances makes it sound as if Solskjaer got lucky, he did not. He had a plan, and it worked.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rashford's goal after 44 minutes had been coming. Throughout the first-half, Manchester United worked on getting their lively three in behind Tottenham's back four: Rashford and Anthony Martial from wide, Jesse Lingard from deep through the middle. They nearly pulled it off on two occasions and then, just before half-time, came the breakthrough. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/17/8469738-6586853-image-a-39_1547401439917.jpg" height="663" width="962" alt="Midfielder Moussa Sissoko is seen to by the Tottenham physios after going down with injury just before the interval" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/17/8469350-6586853-image-a-21_1547399971189.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Erik Lamela  replaces the stricken Sissoko, who was taken off before the break with a suspected groin injury" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/19/8469058-6586853-Sissoko_left_vies_for_possession_with_Paul_Pogba_right_during_th-a-1_1547408411465.jpg" height="643" width="962" alt="Sissoko vies for possession with Paul Pogba during the first half of the game at Wembley on Sunday afternoon" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/16/8468260-6586853-image-a-4_1547397801002.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Rashford sprints past the challenge of Winks before taking on the Tottenham defence in the first half on Sunday afternoon" /><video preload="none" id="1840572" title="Mauricio Pochettino &amp;#39;worried&amp;#39; about Harry Kane&amp;#39;s ankle" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/22/8477228-0-image-a-13_1547417936847.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/01/13/86010216302526577/1024x576_MP4_86010216302526577.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kieran Trippier gave the ball away sloppily inside the Manchester United half, and it landed at the feet of Paul Pogba. He had been marshalled well by Sissoko until his unfortunate withdrawal, but with the big man gone, he was free at last.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pogba had enough time to look up and pick his target, saw Rashford making a run cutting in from the right, and picked him out perfectly. Hugo Lloris, the goalkeeper, was trying to recover his position and was probably not set up as he would have wished as Rashford struck a low shot. He got his fingertips to it, but no more, and in it went at the far corner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was no more than United deserved, either. For all their fine movement and enterprise, for all their possession and impetus, Tottenham did not threaten United's goal until after half-time. At that point, while United hadn't had the best of the game, they had forced the best chances.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the 11th minute, Toby Alderweireld failed to clear a deep Ashley Young cross that was met by Lingard at the far post. He had better options, but went for the shot and, having taken a controlling touch, blasted it over. Soon after, came two good saves from Lloris. For the first Martial played in Rashford, for the second another Trippier error let in Martial, who set off on a powerful, direct run, thwarted by Lloris at the near post.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would surely have been different had Tottenham settled their nerves by scoring early but, set up by Son, Harry Winks seemed confused: should he shoot, should he pass? Ultimately, he failed to do either with conviction and his effort went wide.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tottenham have now lost against Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Wolves at home, plus Arsenal and Watford away. That's four of the big six, and more than half of the teams in the top 11. In no season is that title-winning form, and maybe not even top four if the injury list continues to mount. With seven points separating the teams, Pochettino's worries will not stop at Solskjaer taking his place at Old Trafford next season.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/16/8468264-6586853-image-a-5_1547397807779.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Mauricio Pochettino signals to his Spurs players from his technical area in a lively encounter at Wembley on Sunday" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/17/8467896-6586853-image-a-9_1547399401640.jpg" height="639" width="962" alt="Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward (centre) watched the game from the stands at Wembley" /><video preload="none" id="1840578" title="Ander Herrera shares video of David de Gea after Tottenham win" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/22/8477238-0-image-m-4_1547417955114.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/01/13/7431789498936245921/1024x576_MP4_7431789498936245921.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>MARTIN SAMUEL AT WEMBLEY: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was supposed to be getting by on a wave of good vibes, misty-eyed emotions and weak opponents. His strength was being the anti-Mourinho, the man who brought the simplistic fun and flair back to Manchester United's football. He was probably going to be found out by the first handy team he played. So what are we to make of this, the game that takes his flawless run to six matches across all competitions, the best start of any Manchester United manager? What are we to make of a victory at the home of a team that many considered title contenders, against the manager many think should be king of Old Trafford next season, Mauricio Pochettino? What are we to make when Tottenham had so comprehensively outplayed Manchester United, and the manager once considered the game's master tactician, earlier in the season? This was a side of Solskjaer as yet unseen. Savvy, smart, calculating, yet not negative. He needed an exceptional performance from goalkeeper David De Gea to help him on his way, but there's no shame in that, either. </dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Martin Samuel for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-14T07:25:10.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Tottenham 0-1 Manchester United: Solskjaer wins fist six games as boss</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-14T07:25:10.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Premier League,Dele Alli,Tottenham Hotspur,Romelu lukaku,Manchester United,Harry Kane,Anthony Martial,Paul Pogba,David De Gea,Marcus Rashford</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/13/19/8472904-0-image-a-4_1547408494371.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6586465/Tottenham-vs-Manchester-United-LIVE-score-updates-Premier-League-2018-19.html" title="Tottenham 0-1 Manchester United, RESULT: Marcus Rashford makes it six wins out of six for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as Spurs pay for missed chances in Premier League clash"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sportsnews/article-6586555/Old-Trafford-workers-forced-protect-computers-toilet-leak.html" title="Old Trafford workers forced to protect computers from toilet leak after away fans damage bathroom"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6586379/Who-running-succeed-Jose-Mourinho-Manchester-United-manager.html" title="As Gareth Southgate emerges as a contender for the Manchester United job, who are the runners and riders in the race to succeed Jose Mourinho?"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6586689/Graeme-Souness-adamant-Tottenham-spend-big-win-title.html" title="'If they are going to rely on youth players then forget it, they won't be challenging the big guys': Graeme Souness adamant Tottenham must spend to win the Premier League title"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6584461/Sir-Alex-Ferguson-arrives-Man-Utd-training-ahead-Tottenham-clash.html" title="Nice try, Fergie!

Djokovic had taken pity on his forlorn, raddled opponent, working hard to keep him in the rallies, even conceding a point on a winning shot that had been called out. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/11/17/8383264-6582555-The_former_World_No_1_has_been_struggling_with_his_injury_for_mo-a-39_1547228540252.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Andy Murray has been struggling with his hip injury for more than 18 months" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He afforded Murray the respect he deserved, and that is clearly felt for him throughout tennis, judging by the tributes and love that arrived in torrents on Friday. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Inside, though, Murray would have hated Djokovic's gentle concern. Hated the sympathy, hated his reduced circumstances, hated the pain that never goes away and tells him, with every flinch and wince, that it is almost certainly over. They used to compete as equals. Those days, he assuredly knows, are over.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Later, when he fought unsuccessfully to hold back tears – another losing battle, there are just so many of them these days – as he relayed his latest setback, he spoke about the fun going out of the game.  'I can't do what I want to do, what I love doing,' he said. 'It's not enjoyable anymore.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Enjoyable? When was it ever enjoyable? Murray often looked as miserable as sin on court. He grimaced, cursed, limped. He picked arguments with anonymous figures in his box and, once, comically, at the US Open, with the sun for casting off-putting shadows. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He looked tortured and so were we, because Murray's style, the way he ground out results tactically, often left games on a knife edge. Yet to see that as his one dimensional persona, to take it all at face value, was to misjudge him. That was Murray having fun. That was his idea of a good time. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once he had won the US Open in 2012, once he had got that screeching Grand Slam monkey off his back, Murray loved each harrowing second of it. Great athletes do. Paula Radcliffe genuinely enjoyed running marathon distances to the point of exhaustion; Mo Farah must, too. Great batsmen like fast bowling. Chris Froome positively thrills to cycling uphill. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/11/17/8382490-6582555-The_signs_were_not_good_for_Murray_as_he_was_thrashed_in_a_pract-a-41_1547228543608.jpg" height="412" width="634" alt="Murray would have hated Djokovic’s gentle concern during their practice match this week " /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In those moments when the world looked at Murray and saw a man on the brink of collapse, either physically or emotionally, we missed that this was what he wanted more than anything in the world. That he had pushed his body to its absolute limit to reach this moment. He loved that anguish more than Floyd Mayweather loves money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Murray could have been very good at tennis and still been the best British player since Fred Perry. He could have carried on losing finals, or been satisfied with the last four, and still enjoyed great wealth and the love of the nation. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tim Henman never made it past the semi-final of any Grand Slam tournament and a slab of the All-England Club is named in his honour. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet Murray pushed. He pushed beyond where the natural boundaries of his ability fell because he believed, with extreme athleticism, endurance and strategy, he could overcome the greatest tennis players of this, or any, generation. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So he endured spells of training camp isolation, employed the most demanding coach in Ivan Lendl, sacrificed with an intensity that left rivals in awe, until he achieved his aims. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/11/17/8412018-6582555-image-a-47_1547228808168.jpg" height="418" width="634" alt="Tim Henman never made it past the semis of a Grand Slam yet is still honoured at Wimbledon" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/11/22/8420466-6582555-image-a-32_1547247092490.jpg" height="520" width="634" alt="" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">His greatest matches were brutal, gladiatorial, epic wars of attrition. Darren Cahill, the coach who helped Andre Agassi become the oldest player to reach No 1, explained: 'When you search for examples of 'emptied the bucket to be as good as they could be', there should be a picture of Andy Murray sitting there. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Remarkable discipline for training, competition, sacrifice, perfection. A little crazy, but a legend of a bloke.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Crazy? Of course he was crazy. Before the Davis Cup final in 2015, the sponsors organised a fun quiz between the players and it was Murray who, at the end, fixed the host with a stare that could stun an elephant at ten paces and asked him who had won. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Crazy? After an incredibly intense battle against Djokovic, Murray revealed that he routinely loses a toenail or two during those encounters, simply ripped off by the wear and tear of being moved around the court by such a supreme athlete. He thought the same probably happened to Djokovic against him. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was all so matter-of-fact, all so goes-with-the-territory. It must have hurt like hell. All the time unseen, internal, trauma was taking its toll. There was no-one braver, and certainly, Murray is the only player who has forced Djokovic into what amounted to an act of physical surrender.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His first Grand Slam win, the 2012 US Open, was the longest final in the tournament's history and Djokovic, who forced his way back into the game from two sets down, could take no more. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Murray's 6-2 final set victory was the equivalent of seeing the great welterweight warrior Roberto Duran tell the referee 'no mas' during his title fight with Sugar Ray Leonard in 1980. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/11/17/8383780-6582555-Murray_tasted_his_first_Grand_Slam_success_at_the_age_of_25_when-a-43_1547228558312.jpg" height="419" width="634" alt="His first Grand Slam win, the 2012 US Open, was the longest final in the tournament’s history " /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Djokovic could no longer get around the court; Murray had ground him almost to standstill. It was an astonishing performance, one of the greatest by any British sportsman in history. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is those efforts, those moments, the occasions when Murray has emptied the bucket, that have left him where he is now: in pain so intense just the act of putting on socks is filled with drama.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As recently as 2016, he fulfilled another ambition, rising to No 1 in the rankings. He did this by committing to an extraordinary schedule, culminating in the ATP World Tour final in London. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the end was, as ever, Djokovic for a match that would decide who finished the campaign in premier position. No tennis season had ever concluded that way, with a final between the players vying for top spot. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Murray had lost to Djokovic in 13 of their 15 previous matches. Yet here, again, he triumphed. Somehow, as in Flushing Meadows, as at Wimbledon in 2013, he found a way of overcoming an opponent that is considered his superior. Did this push precipitate the hip issue that will lead to his retirement this year? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Murray was already taking painkillers as a matter of course for hard court matches. Born with bipartite patella – the kneecap remains as separate bones, rather than fusing together – Murray has always placed the most punishing demands on his body. Ultimately, there was always likely to be a debilitating toll.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Murray's detractors – and some remain, despite all the evidence – foolishly compare his record to contemporaries such as Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal and mark him down as inferior.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are right: he is.  So really, he shouldn't have won any Grand Slams at all; he shouldn't be the only player with two Olympic gold medals in singles competition, he shouldn't have spent any time at No 1, he shouldn't have won the Davis Cup for Great Britain with an individual performance that rewrote the record books. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/11/17/8385016-6582555-He_added_a_second_Olympic_gold_medal_to_his_impressive_list_of_s-a-44_1547228568303.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="The Scotsman is the only tennis player with two Olympic gold medals in singles competition" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Given the company, everything he has achieved is against the odds. So it isn't what is missing that counts, but what he has won, and that he has done this as an outlier, in a country with so little heritage in his field, such a scarcity of inspiration. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Every giant step Murray has made, is to escape the shadow of Fred Perry, a pre-war hero. It would be like Rory McIlroy having to look to Henry Cotton as his role model.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was just over a year ago that Murray posted a picture of his younger self, next to his latest injury update – the kid who just wanted to play tennis. Back then, he was contemplating a hip operation and envisaging a positive future where he could exist inside his sport's top 30. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He seemed to have settled for the least-worst scenario. Sadly, he was being optimistic, even then. His ambition now is to make it to a last Wimbledon before retiring, but that deserved farewell is no longer guaranteed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sport is cruel. Murray's next game could be his last, if indeed there is a final match to be played in Melbourne. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This time, the bucket may at last be empty. What an extraordinary, magic vessel it was, though. What an extraordinary, magical man. </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>MARTIN SAMUEL: The public tears were painful enough, but the heartbreak had actually begun earlier on the Margaret Court Arena, as Andy Murray moved agonisingly, helplessly, through an exhibition practice match with Novak Djokovic.

By the time United had launched their fightback against Bayern Munich, scoring an equaliser by Teddy Sheringham in the 91st minute and the winner from Solskjaer two minutes later, the friends had blagged their way into seats near the presidential box.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Matt Barlow for MailOnline</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-11T22:45:13.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Pochettino reveals he cheered on Solskjaer inside Nou Camp in 1999</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-11T22:45:13.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Tottenham Hotspur,Premier League,Manchester United</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/11/14/8405310-0-image-a-33_1547218378855.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6581301/Can-Manchester-United-continue-revival-against-Tottenham-TACKLE-KEOWN.html" title="Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can enhance his credentials for Manchester United job with win at Tottenham, while Chelsea are mad to consider selling Callum Hudson-Odoi — TACKLE KEOWN"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6581085/Manchester-United-boss-Ole-Gunnar-Solskjaer-hardest-game-Tottenham.html" title="Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has his hardest game yet at Tottenham against Mauricio Pochettino (the man tipped to replace him)... here's the key questions before their Wembley showdown"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6581291/Tottenham-vs-Man-United-Ole-Gunnar-Solskjaer-hoping-record-continues.html" title="Watch out Spurs!

Despite Arnaud Massy, a Frenchman, winning the Open in 1907, there was never any suggestion that the USA would take on an entire continent at golf, when the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/ryder_cup/index.html" id="mol-4a59d5a0-1527-11e9-8e9f-1936aa116664">Ryder Cup</a> was in its formative stages.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ryder, the tournament's sponsor, did not entertain this, nor did the magazine Golf Illustrated, whose fund-raising for an American raiding party to challenge for the 1921 Open at St Andrews built the momentum and appetite for an international team competition.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Europe's involvement began in 1979, as a consequence of the United States winning 17 of the previous 18 editions against Great Britain and Ireland. Team Europe pretty much hijacked the Ryder Cup at that point, and it is a good job they did.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/10/21/8375848-6579143-image-a-141_1547155485813.jpg" height="375" width="634" alt="Europe got involved in the Ryder Cup in 1979 as a consequence of the United States winning 17 of the previous 18 editions against Great Britain and Ireland" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'A coupla cocktail parties, we kick their butts and go home,' was Tom Kite's description of the pre-European Ryder Cup and ferocious, proud competitors like Seve Ballesteros and Bernhard Langer changed that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet what the Ryder Cup has never really been about is the European Tour itself. That is an even newer sophistication. The idea that Rory McIlroy needs to show greater loyalty to the game on this side of the Atlantic, or risk forfeiting his place in the Ryder Cup team, is just nonsense. McIlroy has nothing to prove whatsoever.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">European golfers must be members of the European Tour, which seems reasonable, and the Tour rankings are the fairest way of picking the team. This makes selection a meritocracy and gives European tournaments greater meaning. Again, that is only right. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet there the connection ends because, in essence, the Ryder Cup is European-born versus American-born. It is not a battle of the tours. If it were, nationality would not matter. The current leader of the European Tour's Race to Dubai is David Lipsky. He is American.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/10/21/8375312-6579143-image-a-143_1547155528925.jpg" height="413" width="634" alt="It is nonsense to say Rory McIlroy must show more loyalty to golf on this side of the Atlantic" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 2019 rankings are in their infancy, obviously, and once the major players are more seriously involved and the Tour is properly under way, it is unlikely he will remain there.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet say he did, and this was Ryder Cup year. If it was just about the Tour, Lipsky could be a candidate to play against his own country at Whistling Straits in 2020. He isn't. He couldn't be. Nor could Xander Schauffele, the American who finished fourth in the European rankings in 2018.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Patrick Reed, the American who seems to get most from the Ryder Cup, was Europe's second-ranked golfer last year. One imagines he wouldn't be greatly open to changing allegiance, either. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As far as the Ryder Cup goes, it's not where you're at, it's where you're from, and McIlroy is an Ulsterman who chooses to play, and live, in America because that is where the best, most lucrative and most challenging action is. Does that leave him disconnected from the European team? Not at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">McIlroy is often discussed as a huge influence, as is Sergio Garcia, and both men decided long ago that the greatest test of their talents could be found in America.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anyway, it is not as if the European Tour is tied to the continent, either. A look at the 2019 schedule, which begins on January 16, finds it actively avoids Europe until May 9 and before that can be found in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Mexico, Muscat, Qatar, Kenya, Malaysia, the United States, India, Morocco and China. It goes where the money is, yet gets huffy if Europe's golfers do the same.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the World Cup last summer, two countries, Sweden and Senegal, did not have a single player in their squad from the domestic league. Sweden won Germany's group and reached the quarter-finals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Croatia, with just two players from their domestic competition — Dominik Livakovic, the unused third-choice goalkeeper, and midfielder Filip Bradaric, who featured as a substitute for 25 minutes against Iceland — did even better, making the final.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/10/21/8375894-6579143-image-a-147_1547155617073.jpg" height="431" width="634" alt="The current leader of the European Tour's Race to Dubai is David Lipsky. He is American" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nobody considered the other 21 players unsupportive of their nation or unpatriotic. Indeed, Croats appear rather proud of Luka Modric, the World Footballer of the Year, an accolade he certainly would not have won had he remained with his original club, Dinamo Zagreb.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Modric left for Tottenham in 2008, and then Real Madrid, to test himself against the world's best, and it is the same for McIlroy. America's Tour is the strongest and most competitive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The United States have five players in the world's top six, and 13 in the top 20. Why should McIlroy be penalised for wanting to go up against them, in the country that also boasts three of golf's four majors?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Everyone recognises the significance of the PGA Tour. Between 1993 and 1999, Colin Montgomerie won the European Tour seven straight seasons — but the fact he could not win so much as a tournament on the American circuit, until competing as a senior, will always count against him in the pantheon of golf's greats.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Montgomerie was a fine player, but his legacy is devalued by choosing not to compete against Tiger Woods and the best of his day, week in, week out. That was never going to be true of McIlroy, and with four major wins already to his name, plus 10 on the PGA Tour, and seven in Europe, he may yet return to the pinnacle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The criticism is unfair. McIlroy has already paid his dues in European golf. He has won in England, Ireland and Switzerland, plus points east. He has been the European Tour's poster boy and, since 2015, the financial saviour of the Irish Open, which his foundation has sponsored in conjunction with Dubai Duty Free.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/10/21/8375836-6579143-image-a-145_1547155604756.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt=" McIlroy has paid his dues in European golf - he has won in England, Ireland and Switzerland" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, for the first half of 2019 at least, he has made his intentions clear. 'I want to play against the strongest fields,' he announced, 'to continue to contend in the majors and to continue my journey back towards the top of the game.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To that end, so far, he has only signed up for the Scottish Open and the European Masters — two short of the number of tournaments needed for European Tour membership.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Keith Pelley, the chief executive, is trying to persuade him to commit further and space in the calendar remains. McIlroy has spoken of considering his options again in August, so may acquiesce. If he does not, however, does this make him any less European?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no question, as yet, that McIlroy will not commit to Europe's Ryder Cup effort. All he has rejected at this juncture is its business plan, and its value to a golfer of his immense calibre.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Padraig Harrington, Europe's Ryder Cup captain, remains convinced McIlroy will do what is required to make the Ryder Cup team when the time comes and there is no reason to doubt him. McIlroy is equally insistent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Everyone has to look out for themselves,' he added. 'I'm looking out for me.' As this very European tour heads once again to Abu Dhabi next week, most would surely understand.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Arnie is over-rated but don't sell now </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even if the money for Marko Arnautovic was right at £36million, the timing for West Ham is all wrong. Selling the fans' favourite player in January, with the club three points off what might be a European place come the end of the season, is a guaranteed way to sour the mood at the London Stadium.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Arnautovic is over-rated, mostly by Arnautovic. He thinks he is a Champions League player, but his numbers do not back that up. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are 17 players ahead of him in the Premier League scorers' table this season, including three at Liverpool, two at Manchester City, Tottenham, Manchester United and Everton — and even one, Felipe Anderson, at West Ham.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/10/21/8374872-6579143-image-a-127_1547154880448.jpg" height="432" width="634" alt="January is the wrong time for West Ham to go on and sell fans' favourite Marko Arnautovic " /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mark Hughes's staff at Stoke rated Arnautovic as one great game in three and while he has undoubtedly improved since then, he can still deteriorate into petulance, fading into anonymity save an explosion of arm-waving at the perceived failings of his team-mates. At his best, he can be the difference. At his worst, he is high-maintenance, anonymous and disruptive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Every time he goes on a scoring run, there are rumours he wants to leave. Now he wants West Ham to sell him to an unnamed Chinese entity at a time that would be ruinous to their season — and to the board's fragile relationship with the fans.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Without doubt, the presence of Arnautovic, along with the investment in Anderson and others, and the emergence of Declan Rice, has eased tensions at the club. West Ham are playing good football and improving under Manuel Pellegrini, and when this happens, the locals are no longer greatly enraged by separation from their favourite pie and mash shop. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The London Stadium, like any other football ground, turns on results. And there is no better way to bring the bad vibes back than to start losing games having sold the best striker to China.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Had the Arnautovic deal been offered in the summer, that would be different. A January sale, however, leaves little room for manoeuvre. West Ham's board might favour Callum Wilson but there is minimal chance of extracting him from Bournemouth in January with Eddie Howe's team in freefall.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It all smacks too familiarly of the Dimitri Payet fiasco in 2017 when West Ham insisted there would be no sale to Marseille only to cave in at the last, and let him leave for a cut price £25m. Payet has created more chances than any other player in a major European league again this season. He is also wanted in China, and if he leaves, Marseille are expecting to make a profit on a midfielder who will be 32 in March.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/10/21/8375570-6579143-image-a-129_1547154943818.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Felipe Anderson has impressed for West Ham and has scored more goals than Arnautovic" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">No wonder Arnautovic's advisers are refusing to take no for an answer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">West Ham have rejected the bid for Arnautovic, but his brother Danijel still insists he wants out, talking of West Ham paying 'peanuts' for his services — it was £20m, a club record, rising to £25m with add-ons — and of the player fulfilling West Ham's desire to keep them in the Premier League.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Actually, he was signed in July 2017 in the hope that he could help them push for Europe. Perhaps by scoring more than 11 league goals last season.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No doubt West Ham's directors fear another Payet saga. They should be warned against capitulation a second time, though. Not just for what it would do to the team, or for the message it would send to the rest of the Premier League regarding Rice, but for its impact on a tender truce.

Despite Arnaud Massy, a Frenchman, winning the Open in 1907, there was never any suggestion that the USA would take on an entire continent at golf, when the Ryder Cup was in its formative stages. Ryder, the tournament's sponsor, did not entertain this, nor did the magazine Golf Illustrated, whose fund-raising for an American raiding party to challenge for the 1921 Open at St Andrews built the momentum and appetite for an international team competition. Europe's involvement began in 1979, as a consequence of the United States winning 17 of the previous 18 editions against Great Britain and Ireland. Team Europe pretty much hijacked the Ryder Cup at that point, and it is a good job they did.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Martin Samuel - Sport for the Daily

His contract will not expire next year but, by activating this extension, Spurs have triggered a clause which means the centre-half will be allowed to leave for £27million during a set period of time in the summer.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Matt Barlow for MailOnline</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-09T13:03:43.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Alderweireld says he's happy to remain at Tottenham for another year </mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-09T13:03:43.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Premier League,Transfer News,Tottenham Hotspur</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8310310-0-image-a-58_1547037596811.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1147327</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Getty Images</mi:licensorName></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6570897/Tottenham-ready-open-new-home-March-eight-months-late.html" title="Tottenham hope to open new stadium in March for the visit of Crystal Palace after chairman Daniel Levy apologises for latest delay with three more League games confirmed at Wembley"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6572285/Levy-slaps-225m-price-tag-Eriksen-amid-Real-Madrid.html" title="Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy 'slaps £225m price tag on Christian Eriksen amid interest from Real Madrid'"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6572305/TRANSFER-NEWS-LIVE-Latest-Arsenal-Liverpool-Manchester-United-Chelsea-updates.html" title="TRANSFER NEWS LIVE: Latest Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea updates plus more from across Europe as January window hots up"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6570841/Tottenham-1-0-Chelsea-PLAYER-RATINGS-7-5-10-MOTM-Harry-Kane-display.html" title="Tottenham 1-0 Chelsea PLAYER RATINGS: Paulo Gazzaniga solid for Spurs but Harry Kane is the star man in Carabao Cup semi-final first leg"></atom:link></item><item><title>Desperate for a striker, N'Golo Kante compromised for Jorginho and no Plan B… why Maurizio Sarri and Chelsea are searching for answers amid sub-par 'Sarriball' </title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6573023/Why-Maurizio-Sarri-Chelsea-searching-answers-amid-sub-par-Sarriball.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2019 12:39:14 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6573023</guid><description><![CDATA[MATT BARLOW: Losing twice to Spurs inside seven weeks at Wembley is no Chelsea fan's idea of a having a good time and the manager is searching for answers.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="mol-para-with-font">Maurizio Sarri arrived at Chelsea promising fun and after a season of <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/antonio-conte/index.html" id="mol-921387a0-140b-11e9-a21f-8dff9f829f63">Antonio Conte</a>'s thunderous moods it was a message well received.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/eden-hazard/index.html" id="mol-9213d5c0-140b-11e9-a21f-8dff9f829f63">Eden Hazard</a> perked up immediately as the campaign opened with an unbeaten run of 18 games in all competitions and there was even a time, albeit brief, when it seemed he might solve the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/alvaro-morata/index.html" id="mol-92131270-140b-11e9-a21f-8dff9f829f63">Alvaro Morata</a> puzzle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was lots to like about Sarriball and its eccentric creator, lost in his own world of tactical analysis, tobacco and superstition.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8309668-6573023-image-m-56_1547036424149.jpg" height="592" width="634" alt="Maurizio Sarri expresses his frustration as Chelsea lose to Tottenham in the Carabao Cup " /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8309858-6573023-image-a-57_1547036514643.jpg" height="473" width="634" alt="The Italian remonstrates with fourth officials Kevin Friend on the touchline at Wembley " /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then came the humbling at the hands of Tottenham in November and the impetus has faded, goals have dried up and the arm of Sarri's fun-o-meter swung back from the image of happy Hazard to the glum face of Morata.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not a lot is wrong.

He wins the ball and moves it quickly; a turnover specialist.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was the secret behind the Leicester miracle, helped Chelsea to the title and France to the World Cup. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He has signed a new five-year contract, thought to be worth £290,000 a week and yet he does not fit smoothly into Sarri's three-man midfield.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8309998-6573023-image-a-64_1547036797597.jpg" height="440" width="634" alt="N'Golo Kante goes in for a challenge with Tottenham's Danny Rose on Tuesday night" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's hard to believe no-one saw this one coming.

He is a ball-winning midfielder and needs licence to run. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Conte soon realised he was wasted, sitting in front of the centre-halves when he switched from 4-2-3-1 to 3-4-3, the key moment in 2016-17. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8310032-6573023-image-a-66_1547036868899.jpg" height="416" width="634" alt="Jorginho is the true heartbeat of Sarriball but his presence in midfield has displaced Kante" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS sport" data-version="2" id="mol-092e0470-140a-11e9-a21f-8dff9f829f63">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Chelsea fixtures</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Premier League unless stated</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Saturday </strong>Newcastle (H)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>January 19</strong> Arsenal (A)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>January 24</strong> Tottenham (H) <span class="mol-style-italic">Carabao Cup semi-final, second leg</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>January 26/27</strong> Sheffield Wednesday or Luton (H) <span class="mol-style-italic">FA Cup fourth round</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>January 30</strong> Bournemouth (A)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>February 2 </strong>Huddersfield (H)</p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">He can operate perfectly well on the right side of Sarri's midfield trio and sometimes even look good but this role does not maximise his unique talents. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No longer does everyone leave every Chelsea game thinking: Wow, Kante…</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With Hazard through the centre and Kante on the right, they are without their two best players. Jorginho, meanwhile, has become too easy to neutralise and has not been able to justify this decision to compromise Kante.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To get the best from Kante, the manager would have to abandon the system to which he is wed.

He wanted the ball moving more quickly. He demanded one-touch and two-touch football and movement from his team.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chelsea have high-quality players. They soon picked it up. But opponents have reacted to combat the threat. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They sit back, congest key areas, crowd Sarri's team and then try to damage them on the counter-attack.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leicester and Wolves, quick on the break, beat them. Tottenham's penalty at Wembley came from a long ball over the top.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8310150-6573023-image-a-68_1547037085547.jpg" height="408" width="634" alt="The speedy and direct Pedro has been a big miss for Sarri following his injury troubles" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Losing Pedro to injury didn't help. Pedro is fast and direct and his powers may be fading but he still offers Sarri something his other strikers don't.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also, Chelsea do not have the speed at full back when others do. Cesar Azpilicueta was ideal for Conte's back three. Marcos Alonso, a terrific wing-back. Neither fit quite so perfectly into Sarri's plans.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the same time, fatigue is setting in, testing Sarri's desire to operate with a small core of first-team players, resisting any major squad rotation, even in the early stages of the Europa League and the Carabao Cup.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8310210-6573023-image-a-79_1547037235605.jpg" height="413" width="634" alt="Marcos Alonso is a world class wing-back yet doesn't dovetail perfectly with Sarri's strategy" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The development stages of a successful foreign coach arriving in the Premier League often follows a similar theme.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They will arrive and demand more running and intensity, then realise all this high-intensity running around in the world's most competitive league and its demanding fixture fixtures is tiring, and then complain about the gruelling schedule and demand more players.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">NO PLAN B</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps most noticeable in the goalless draw against Southampton when Ralph Hasenhuttl came to Stamford Bridge with a plan to bore Chelsea into submission.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sarri's team had 72 per cent of possession and 17 shots but only six on target. The numbers were similar at Spurs in the Carabao Cup. Only Hazard's individuality lifted Chelsea above the ordinary at Watford on Boxing Day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As more teams - especially those unwilling to go toe-to-toe at football - adopted this tactical plan, scoring has become a problem for Chelsea.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sarri said he was satisfied up to the last 20 metres of the pitch against Saints but the last 20 metres is the important bit.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8310228-6573023-image-a-81_1547037344045.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Chelsea were left frustrated last week by a Southampton team who packed their defence " /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chelsea have failed to find the net in three of their last six games and the manager is behaving as if he thinks he does not have the solution inside his squad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Still, he keeps plugging away with his way of playing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Liverpool finished against Manchester City with Virgil van Dijk at centre-forward. When all else fails, go long to the biggest man you have. When you're crowded out, the most obvious alternatives are set-pieces and aerial attack.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Sarri seems so devoted to his system he has shown no hint of a willingness to change.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe a new centre forward would help. Maybe Higuain can provide the technical presence and score enough goals to make a difference. Maybe it would offer Hazard a little more freedom. Maybe it would lift the manager.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sarriball, however, is a collective philosophy. Maybe it will need more than a new centre forward before it is remodelled successfully for the Premier League.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/12/8310298-6573023-image-a-83_1547037403923.jpg" height="567" width="634" alt="Higuain could be the man to revive Sarriball - the two men worked together when at Napoli" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>MATT BARLOW: There was lots to like about Sarriball and its eccentric creator, lost in his own world of tactical analysis, tobacco and superstition.

There is still work to do at Stamford Bridge if Mauricio Pochettino is to lead his team out in the Carabao Cup final on February 24. Chelsea responded once behind and it is well within their powers of recovery to turn it around when these London rivals meet again in a fortnight, in a competition where away goals do not count.

They have identified Blackett who is versatile enough to operate in central defence or at left back as a top target but have now had three bids turned down by their Championship rivals.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Matt Barlow for MailOnline</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-08T19:45:18.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Reading REJECT £450,000 offer from Wigan for Tyler Blackett </mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-08T19:45:18.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Transfer News,Reading,Wigan Athletic</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/15/8272340-0-image-a-80_1546959731535.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1000621</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Action Images</mi:licensorName></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6568645/Ki-Jana-Hoever-Liverpools-youngest-player-happened-others.html" title="Ki-Jana Hoever became Liverpool's third-youngest player against Wolves... but what happened to former starlets Jerome Sinclair and Jack Robinson?"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6569255/Barcelona-beat-Manchester-City-free-transfer-France-U20s-centre-Jean-Clair-Todibo.html" title="Barcelona beat Manchester City to the free transfer of France U20s centre back Jean-Clair Todibo from Toulouse"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6568109/TRANSFER-NEWS-LIVE-Latest-movements-January-window.html" title="TRANSFER NEWS RECAP: Latest from day eight of the transfer window for Premier League and European clubs"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6568867/Chelsea-starlet-Tammy-Abraham-TURNS-Wolves-loan-plans-stay-Aston-Villa.html" title="Tammy Abraham TURNS DOWN Wolves loan and plans to stay at Aston Villa... but he would accept a permanent switch to Premier League "></atom:link></item><item><title>Padraig Harrington aims dig at Nick Faldo, defends Rory McIlroy and eyes wildcard cut as he's named Ryder Cup captain for 2020</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-6568953/Padraig-Harrington-named-Europes-captain-2020-Ryder-Cup.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2019 13:03:40 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">6568953</guid><description><![CDATA[The three-time major winner succeeds Thomas Bjorn, as Europe bid to defend the trophy.

For starters, he will be advocating a tweak to the qualifying system, with three wildcards instead of four.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He followed that with the revelation there will be no place for close friend Paul McGinley on his backroom team. There was a robust defence of Rory McIlroy after his controversial remarks about the European Tour being a ‘stepping stone’ to the PGA Tour, before a dig at Sir Nick Faldo’s captaincy in 2008.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As ever, each point was thoughtfully delivered, with plenty of humour, too. Asked whether there was any chance of him following in the footsteps of Thomas Bjorn and getting a tattoo done where the sun doesn’t shine, he replied: ‘I think it’s time we rear-ended that tradition, don’t you?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let’s start with McGinley. Such an inspirational skipper at Gleneagles in 2014, why wouldn’t you call on his wisdom as a vice-captain? ‘I will be relying on Paul, of course but not in an official capacity,’ said Harrington.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He doesn’t need to be coming back. I feel the job has moved on and it’s incumbent on the captain to bring players in as vice-captains who could be future captains. It’s too important a role now, and no longer a jolly, if it ever was.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You might have thought he would get his feet under the table before tackling the qualification process but, again, he displays impeccable logic. ‘I’m having stats done to see if they back up what I feel anecdotally but I’m leaning to three picks instead of four,’ he said.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/13/8268668-6568953-image-a-46_1546953552085.jpg" height="427" width="634" alt="Harrington has served as a vice-captain at the last three Ryder Cups and played six times" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I find it hard to think how you would overlook the ninth player in the qualifying list, when you’ve got four picks, and my experience is that a player who finishes ninth feels more comfortable and has more belief in himself when he’s qualified rather than getting a pick.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What about McIlroy — is it damaging to team morale when he is so disparaging about his home tour? ‘I read what Rory said but look at his actions,’ argued Harrington. ‘That man loves the Ryder Cup, and he gets so much from it that he can’t get anywhere else. He’s not 30 yet and he gets to be the leader in the team room. He gets the glory and the opportunity to be loved on the course.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He will be 100 per cent behind us, don’t worry about that. Yes, he’s moved to America, and his family is there. He wants to win the Masters, and so those words come out. But if you know the man behind the scenes, he’s as European as they come.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Harrington appears such a natural fit, it comes as something of a shock to hear he wrestled long and hard before taking on the captaincy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I can see it’s a natural progression after being a player on six occasions and a vice-captain three times, but it’s not something I’ve taken on lightly,’ said the 47-year-old Irishman.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Just because it might seem to be my time doesn’t mean I didn’t think deeply about it. There’s a certain trepidation because I really want to leave the Ryder Cup and the European Tour in a better place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But I know as captain you’re putting it on the line and you’re great if you win or it’s your fault if you lose. It’s exciting but also daunting thinking I’m going to have to find an edge if we’re to beat a very strong American team on home soil.’</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/08/13/8268892-0-image-a-48_1546953985035.jpg" height="403" width="634" alt="Harrington said he is 'thrilled' to be captain but admits some 'trepidation' at the responsibility" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Underlining the scale of the task he has taken on in defending the trophy at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin next year, only once in the last 15 years has the away team won — and that needed a miracle at Medinah. To prepare, Harrington will call on the counsel of every captain from the last 20 years. Well, all but one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Eight put their heart and soul into the job, so they will certainly be a help, while one did it half-heartedly, and that didn’t end so good,’ said Harrington.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just in case anyone had doubts as to the identity of the miscreant, Harrington added: ‘It shows that just because you’re a successful player, it doesn’t mean you’ll be a great captain.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It promises to be a revelatory 20 months, doesn’t it?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>Padraig Harrington has been named as Europe's captain for the 2020 Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits.

What is more concerning is the fact the start of his new adventure in Hawaii on Sunday was marked by the resurfacing of some wearingly familiar failings that leave him with no chance of attaining his goal unless they are eradicated. Peerless off the tee, and perfectly placed in the final group after three rounds, McIlroy could not buy a putt on Sunday to fall to joint-fourth behind American Xander Schauffele. Now, where have we heard that before?</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Derek Lawrenson for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-07T23:58:43.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Destructive putting leaves McIlroy with a major problem</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-07T23:58:43.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/07/22/8242834-0-image-a-61_1546898488596.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1104735</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>AP</mi:licensorName></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-6554309/Vijay-Singh-55-shows-staggering-fitness-regime-including-smashing-tyres-golf-clubs.html" title="Not bad for a 55-year-old golfer!

That Callum Hudson-Odoi has a bright future with Chelsea. That he has improved. That he can now be considered a rival to Willian and Pedro.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I can play with only two wingers,' Sarri announced. 'Three is difficult but now he is ready. He can play, but of course sometimes he will be on the bench.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For a man who worked in banking, however, Sarri's numbers leave a little to be desired. <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/eden-hazard/index.html" id="mol-dc1d7590-12cb-11e9-8fd0-53458dbcd9ab">Eden Hazard</a> also likes to play wide, unless Sarri is admitting he will spend the rest of his Chelsea career as a central forward.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/07/21/8242034-6566775-Rising_star_Callum_Hudson_Odoi_is_facing_a_crossroads_already_in-m-6_1546897099353.jpg" height="490" width="634" alt="Rising star Callum Hudson-Odoi is facing a crossroads already in his young Chelsea career" /><video preload="none" id="1836800" title="Maurizio Sarri talks about Callum Hudson-Odoi&amp;#39;s future" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/07/13/video-8226196-287_636x358.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/01/07/7190538808558898301/1024x576_MP4_7190538808558898301.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there is Christian Pulisic, who is a wide player and will arrive in the summer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So by next season, if Chelsea retain their talent and buy a striker, the equation is five into two, which suggests one pair of wingers won't even make substitute.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's about patience,' said Sarri's assistant, Gianfranco Zola, last week. No, it isn't. At Chelsea, it's about winning at all costs, and the folly of patience is what they trick you with; ask Ruben Loftus-Cheek.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's like the three-cup scam. Give them a swirl. Now where is your opportunity hiding? Beneath the one on the left? Bad luck. Try again and, this time, I won't move them. Right, you say? Wrong again. Must be the middle one, then? No. Looks like your chance was never there at all. But, hey, what's that behind your ear?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet they keep falling for it, these young men. Loftus-Cheek is 23 this month, has 10 England appearances mainly on the back of regular football on loan at Crystal Palace, but is still waiting for his breakthrough. The fact is, no academy prospect has emerged to win a regular place at Chelsea in the Roman Abramovich era. John Terry is cited as the success story, but had already made 118 first-team appearances when the club changed hands.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The assurances Hudson-Odoi is receiving have been heard plenty of times before, from a host of managers. Even if Sarri believed in a young player - as Carlo Ancelotti did Josh McEachran, for instance - he could be gone on the back of one bad season, or a poor run of results.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/07/21/8242078-6566775-Hudson_Odoi_shone_against_Nottingham_Forest_on_Saturday_in_a_rar-m-15_1546897259830.jpg" height="435" width="634" alt="Hudson-Odoi shone against Nottingham Forest on Saturday in a rare start for the 18-year-old" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chelsea managers do not get the time to indulge hunches about youth talent. Antonio Conte favoured Andreas Christensen. Where is he now?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last week, Dominic Solanke signed for Bournemouth. Good luck to him for refusing to settle, good luck to them for keeping faith in young English talent. Solanke was at Chelsea too, but when he identified a dead end, switched to Liverpool in 2017 in search of first-team opportunity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That also petered out, so now he is at Bournemouth in a £19million permanent deal that has raised eyebrows. Strange, isn't it, this attitude to English youth? We demand they seek opportunity, not settle for the comfort of the extended squad, yet castigate Bournemouth and Solanke over what is seen as an inflated fee. How can Bournemouth pay £19m for a player who has not featured in a game for Liverpool this season?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leaving aside how difficult it is for a young player to get in at Anfield ahead of Mo Salah, Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane, Daniel Sturridge or even Divock Origi, who exactly were Bournemouth to buy?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is an Icelandic striker at Augsburg in Germany, for instance, who is being touted this January. Alfred Finnbogason interested Celtic two seasons ago and some struggling Premier League clubs have made enquiries. Yet he will be 30 on February 1 and the asking price is £15m.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/07/21/8242106-6566775-Ruben_Loftus_Cheek_left_is_nearly_23_and_is_still_finding_first_-m-17_1546897379246.jpg" height="419" width="634" alt="Ruben Loftus-Cheek (left) is nearly 23 and is still finding first-team opportunities hard to come" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Should Bournemouth have gone for that type of player or tried to work with what we have here?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Solanke will in all likelihood be England's Under 21 striker at the European Championship in Italy this summer. He keeps out Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who has featured in 21 games for Everton this season. He may yet be the player to reverse Bournemouth's fortunes and if Eddie Howe can realise his potential in a way that Chelsea and Liverpool could not, will then be worth several times more than his most recent fee.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Either way, this is a career choice that should be encouraged. Hudson-Odoi has an option too, but it would mean Chelsea losing him to Bayern Munich. What a pity if another member of a hugely promising generation of English footballers feels he has no option but to go abroad. A pity, but understandable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With Solanke it is different. He has stayed here, even dropped out of the elite, because at 21 he wants to play.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is a time for patience, but also a time when it is entitled to run out. Solanke has done the maths, as Hudson-Odoi surely will, too.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/07/21/8242158-6566775-Dominic_Solanke_left_Chelsea_to_play_regularly_something_Hudson_-m-19_1546897453830.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="Dominic Solanke left Chelsea to play regularly - something Hudson-Odoi is considering" /><video preload="none" id="1835216" title="Premier League transfer round-up: Solanke signs for Bournemouth" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/04/22/video-8144172-319_636x358.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/01/04/6579372933661609710/1024x576_MP4_6579372933661609710.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The World Jewish Congress made it very clear. 'The word yid has for years been re-appropriated from its original Yiddish to carry a distinctly pejorative and anti-Semitic message, and its use by fans in the stands, either as a self-designated nickname or as a slogan against rivals must not be tolerated in any way.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So how can Tottenham's fans claim to be defending Jews with their 'Yid Army' chants - particularly as the overwhelming number are gentiles anyway? What are they to do now? Presume to continue lecturing Semites on the precise nature of anti-Semitism? Fake the reclamation of a word that was never theirs in the first place? That really would take some chutzpah, as the majority of Spurs fans wouldn't say.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Penalty row left Mitrovic on spot</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Is it really any surprise that a missed penalty preceded Fulham's FA Cup exit to Oldham on Sunday? The drama over the taker during the match with Huddersfield on December 29 - Aboubakar Kamara refused to hand the ball over to Aleksandar Mitrovic, and then missed - has made it too much of an issue.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mitrovic will have had all that on his mind when he stepped up against Oldham - particularly as there were six minutes to go, and the scores were tied 1-1. What should have been a straightforward conversion was imbued with added pressure, and Fulham have enough of that already.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/07/21/8241984-6566775-image-a-4_1546896954211.jpg" height="404" width="634" alt="Aleksandar Mitrovic saw his penalty saved as Fulham tumbled out of the FA Cup on Sunday" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">VAR can make game fairer, but not better</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The confusion around VAR is such that Alvaro Morata made an appeal for its use against Nottingham Forest on Saturday, when it was not in operation. Why, who knows? As a Premier League ground, Stamford Bridge has the capacity for it yet the FA decided only six ties would be subject to it on Saturday. Chelsea's was not among them. Why ration the truth?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Equally problematic is the procedure. VAR may utilise technology, but it also involves humanity, and humans are flaky. It was utterly ridiculous that Simon Hooper, the referee at Burnley's match with Barnsley, should allow the penalty-taking ritual to unfold, without alerting the players that a VAR review into the award was also taking place. It meant the penalty was aborted as Matej Vydra ran up to take it. Suppose that verdict had arrived two seconds later, by which time Vydra had scored? Try explaining that to the crowd.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The greatest flaw with VAR, however, was revealed by Mark Clattenburg on these pages. Analysing a VAR call at Manchester United, he wrote: 'Once a goal is scored, the VAR process kicks in and the video referee must check three things: Was there a foul in the build-up? Was the ball out of play? Was there an offside?' In other words, the message is: 'A goal has been scored - how can we disallow it?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So while you may be getting more accuracy next season, what you certainly won't be getting is more goals, because VAR exists to chalk them off, not put them on. If a referee has mistakenly given a free-kick against a team on a counter-attack, that decision stands and that advantage cannot be recreated; if the team scores, however, the duty of VAR is to try to locate an infringement 40 yards down the field in an earlier phase of play, and rule it out. Will it make the game fairer? Possibly. Will it make it better? Not if Clattenburg's understanding is the way it genuinely works.</p><video preload="none" id="1699576" title="VAR or Not VAR: Football legends give their view on the technology" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/22/4CCC3DCF00000578-0-image-m-5_1527803610734.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2018/05/31/1641370115753555531/1024x576_MP4_1641370115753555531.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Claude Puel will be vilified for fielding a weakened team and making seven changes in Leicester's loss to Newport, but with the FA Cup arriving on the back of such a punishing Christmas schedule it is hard to see how managers have much alternative. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anyway, the statistics do not always support consistency. For instance, 60 per cent of teams making four changes from their last league game won; as opposed to just 25 per cent of teams making three changes. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for the 17 clubs that made eight changes or more this weekend, 10 won and only six lost - and two of the six losers were playing clubs from the same division, while Rotherham faced Manchester City away. It is always a gamble to field a lesser team in the FA Cup, but it should not guarantee calamity. Look at Leicester's starting XI against Newport: Puel will not be alone in thinking they had more than enough to win. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/07/22/8243020-6566775-Claude_Puel_made_seven_changes_as_Leicester_lost_2_1_at_Newport_-m-22_1546898771991.jpg" height="419" width="634" alt="Claude Puel made seven changes as Leicester lost 2-1 at Newport in the FA Cup on Sunday" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Canny West Ham show how to save the FA Cup</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unnoticed on Saturday was a little FA Cup miracle: 54,840 tickets sold at the London Stadium to watch West Ham play Birmingham City. Only Manchester United, at home to Reading, attracted a bigger gate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The method behind it was hardly rocket science. Competitive pricing for a low-key match. West Ham sold kids tickets for £1 and discounted adult sales to as little as £10. Their reward was a largely full stadium, down just four per cent from the gate for the previous League match with Brighton, on a weekend when declining interest in the FA Cup was again a topic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And is it any wonder, now the Christmas period is busier than ever? West Ham, like all clubs, will have played four games in less than two weeks, two of which will have been at home. Then, days later, an FA Cup tie. No wonder fans feel fatigued, financially and physically. The players are exhausted and many of the best ones rested, and if the opposition is weak, teams as good as field the reserves. Who wants to pay top dollar for that?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">West Ham attracted much criticism last week after it was revealed the club charges £700 to be a matchday mascot - Leicester's fee is £600, but that did not receive half the condemnation, perhaps because it does not suit the positive narrative about the club's ownership - but being a mascot is a perk, a bonus. The overwhelming majority of supporters will have followed teams all their lives without getting to run out with the captain on match day. It is far healthier, and reaches many more kids, to let them watch football on the cheap. The FA Cup isn't dying, as some would have you believe, and it doesn't require radical restructure. Just a bit of thought.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/07/22/8243110-6566775-The_London_Stadium_had_an_attendance_of_54_840_as_West_Ham_beat_-m-24_1546898974129.jpg" height="541" width="634" alt="The London Stadium had an attendance of 54,840 as West Ham beat Birmingham on Saturday" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite their difficulties, Fulham are considering ending Timothy Fosu-Mensah's loan spell early, after just nine appearances.

Having driven out Mick McCarthy last season on the grounds his football wasn't exciting enough, the adventures just keep coming.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On Saturday, Ipswich succumbed to a thrilling 1-0 FA Cup defeat at Accrington Stanley. The club is already on its second manager of the season, is 10 points shy of safety, bottom of the Championship and has won two League games all season. Owner Marcus Evans is so excited by it all, he wants to sell.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The fact is, McCarthy was doing a very creditable job in trying circumstances, as he has through much of his career. When he left Millwall in 1995-96 they were 14 points off relegation, and ended up going down. He departed Wolves in 2012 when they had just entered the relegation zone in 18th place on goal difference, but had the same points total as Queens Park Rangers in 16th. They went down too, bottom of the league, 12 points plus goal difference adrift of safety.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for Ipswich, they were 12th when McCarthy left last season and have won three games since.

Europa League tie in Hungary, last month, condemning the ‘brain-power’ of those who continually ‘shame’ the club.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With Chelsea and Tottenham about to meet at Wembley, on Tuesday, in the first leg of a Carabao Cup semi-final, the World Jewish Congress (WJC) issued a statement from New York.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">WJC chief executive Robert Singer said: ‘Contrary to the protests of many fans, there is no grey area when it comes to slurs that target a particular religious, racial, or ethnic group. The word Y** has for years been re-appropriated from its original Yiddish to carry a distinctly pejorative and anti-semitic message.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The innocence this word once carried, as a simple translation for Jew, has long disappeared.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/04/21/8143314-6559037-image-a-18_1546638118908.jpg" height="386" width="634" alt="Tottenham are under increasing pressure to take action against their own supporters" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We hope that the actions being taken by Chelsea will establish the groundwork for more tolerance. We would also ask Tottenham to take a stand against the use of “Y** Army”, Y** and “Y****s” by their fans. Such a long overdue action is important to kick anti-semitism off the pitch.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A Tottenham spokesman said: ‘We remain wholly committed to ensuring that a zero tolerance position is adopted in respect of anti-semitic behaviour. The Y-word was originally adopted in order to deflect such abuse.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We have always been clear that our fans (both Jewish and gentile) have never used the term with any intent to cause offence. A re-assessment of its use can only occur effectively within the context of a total clampdown on unacceptable anti-semitism.’</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>Tottenham are under increasing pressure to take action against their own supporters after the influential World Jewish Congress urged the club to take an ‘overdue’ stand against those who self-identify with the Y-word.

The best team doesn’t always win,’ said Warne, who was in Rotherham’s attack for a 1-1 draw with City in League One in March 2002 — the last time the teams met.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘With Oldham we played away in the FA Cup at Chasetown on a wet, muddy pitch and it was the live TV game. Our captain, Chris Swailes, reckoned their captain wanted to fight him when he went to hand in the team sheet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He returned and said, “They’re a bit revved up, he didn’t even have a shirt on”. We got a draw and battered them in the replay. That’s why fans love the FA Cup.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘And that’s the thing with City. The levels are so wide some of the things my players do they won’t be used to seeing. They might be confused if Jon Taylor or Ryan Williams run at them.’</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/04/22/8144176-6559077-image-a-65_1546639798335.jpg" height="438" width="634" alt="" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now 45, Warne was dressed as an elf, waiting to shoot a Christmas advert for the club shop when he learned he was to be Rotherham’s next manager. ‘The chief exec tapped me on the shoulder and said, “You’d better get out of the elf outfit. You’re going to be the caretaker manager”.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was late November 2016. Rotherham had seven points from 18 Championship games and Kenny Jackett had walked out after only 39 days in charge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Warne was the fitness coach and a popular figure after playing nearly 300 games at the club in two spells covering 10 years. ‘I thought it would be one game,’ he admitted. He was in charge for the rest of the season but was unable to prevent relegation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I was chewing at my mouth when I was sleeping — waking up and spitting blood. I lost a stone in weight. I wanted to do well but my record was horrendous.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It hit me hard. I went from being a fitness coach who cycled 40 miles a day, ran with the team and swam with the injured lads to a manager who drove to work, didn’t eat because I was wired from drinking caffeine all day. I got home and I’d done no exercise, hadn’t eaten.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I wasn’t engaged with my wife and kids. I’d watch TV but you could ask me at the end what had happened and I didn’t have a Scooby.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘If we lost, I’d pull into a lay-by for half an hour before I got home. I couldn’t face their pity. They look at you like they know how much you’re hurting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘My daughter had a party on a Tuesday and she said, “Dad, if you lose on Saturday will you still be down by the Tuesday”. I thought, “Jesus Christ”. She was 10.’</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/04/22/8144154-6559077-image-a-66_1546639820993.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Manager Warne spoke to Sportmail's Matt Barlow ahead of Sunday's trip to the Etihad Stadium" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It did not prevent Warne from taking the job permanently at the end of the season and he devoured leadership books to find a style to suit his infectious personality.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He convinced his chairman, Tony Stewart, to invest in the training ground rather than transfers and set about improving his players.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tears flowed as Warne stood before his squad and explained the motivational force of his family. Players followed suit. One told of losing a best friend in an accident, another of losing a child. ‘To be successful our internal relationships have to be strong,’ said Warne. ‘I can’t bring anyone in who is going to break that.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He has urged players to connect with fans through social media, and adorned walls with images of the wins, points and clean sheets collected on the way to winning promotion last season.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/04/22/8144152-6559077-image-a-68_1546639826069.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="An optimistic Warne said: 'Some of the things my players do they won't be used to seeing'" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another idea, taken from his friend Paul Thompson, former head coach of Sheffield Steelers ice hockey team, was to commission a print of Rotherham’s windmill crest to place in the centre of the dressing-room floor at away games. It will be at the Etihad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At Christmas, Warne gave his players 13 different self-improvement books with titles such as Ego is the Enemy and The Obstacle is the Way and told them to read at least one chapter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘They’ll have to stand up and tell us what they’ve read,’ he said. ‘If they didn’t like it, fine. If it improves a few, great. You’ve got to be honest with yourself and that’s the idea behind the books. Footballers can be quick to blame others when things go wrong.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last year, Warne found himself at an awards ceremony at the same table as Guardiola separated only by Blackburn boss Tony Mowbray. When Mowbray stood to address the room and said he was honoured to be sitting next to the world’s greatest coach, Warne couldn’t resist the joke: ‘I said he must mean me, that’s a nice gesture. He didn’t take it too well.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An FA Cup upset won’t appeal to Pep’s sense of humour, either.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/04/22/8144200-6559077-image-a-69_1546639925051.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Former striker Warne has been in charge at Rotherham's New York Stadium since 2016" />]]></content:encoded><dc:description>INTERVIEW: Paul Warne has tasted the blood.

Not just at Manchester City; across his entire career.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And while his detractors will insist this means nothing, given the clubs he has coached, anyone who understands the demands, even at an elite level, even with the finest players, will comprehend just how precious that record is.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sir Alex Ferguson, for instance, lost back to back in 2001: 3-0 to Chelsea on December 1, 1-0 to West Ham a week later, and on three other occasions previously with <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html" id="mol-5bfd4fa0-1070-11e9-89f0-b5d765836fe9">Manchester United</a>. <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/jurgen_klopp/index.html" id="mol-5bfd9dc0-1070-11e9-89f0-b5d765836fe9">Jurgen Klopp</a> did so on three occasions at <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/teampages/borussia-dortmund.html" id="mol-5bfd2890-1070-11e9-89f0-b5d765836fe9">Borussia Dortmund</a>, most recently in October 2014. Yet Guardiola? Never. Incredibly, we may have underestimated him. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/04/20/8140052-6558799-Pep_Guardiola_showed_off_a_side_we_don_t_usually_get_to_see_from-m-6_1546634996698.jpg" height="515" width="634" alt="Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola showed off a side we don't usually get to see from him" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/04/19/8140076-6558799-image-a-12_1546630928446.jpg" height="437" width="634" alt="City came out on top 2-1 against Liverpool, in a game with massive implications for the title" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/04/20/8140092-6558799-Pep_Guardiola_has_been_warned_about_his_behaviour_by_the_FA_afte-m-7_1546635053833.jpg" height="417" width="634" alt="Pep Guardiola has been warned about his behaviour by the FA after berating the fourth official" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">For a record of that nature does not endure if the manager coaches just one idea. It does not exist without a measure of compromise. We picture Guardiola as this idealist, who cherishes only beauty and grace. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His team loses at Chelsea because he refuses to kill Sarri-ball by devoting a player to Jorginho. He goes to Liverpool and plays his way against Klopp, even when the record shows that this method has faltered before.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet on Thursday night, English football saw a different side of the man, and his team. A side we did not know existed. Late in the game, when Guardiola was imploring his goalkeeper, Ederson, to kick long, to alleviate pressure and take time out of the game, this was a changed man. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Has Guardiola bent, if only a little, to the physical demands of the English season? Or has this pragmatic side always been there, but has never needed to be used with Manchester City before?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most certainly, Guardiola can alter his path. In his first season with Bayern Munich, he was dissatisfied after a 1-1 draw with Freiburg and another disappointment in the UEFA Super Cup against Chelsea, which his team won, but only on penalties. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/04/20/8140102-6558799-Manchester_City_will_be_celebrating_closing_the_gap_to_first_at_-m-8_1546635146031.jpg" height="482" width="634" alt="Manchester City will be celebrating closing the gap to first at the top of the Premier League" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He showed Munich’s players a video of them passing sideways, back and forth, across the defensive line. ‘This is tiki-taka,’ he told them, ‘and it is s***.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The innovation was to place Phillip Lahm in midfield and focus on breaking opposition lines, rather than staying safely imprisoned by them. There followed a run of 16 wins and one draw in 17 games.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is not as if Guardiola made permanent changes to Manchester City’s philosophy against Liverpool, but he sent his side out to fight in a way that had not been witnessed before. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With Bernardo Silva the standard-bearer, running 13.7 kilometres — had he set off east from the Etihad Stadium, he would have been close to the border with Derbyshire by the time Anthony Taylor blew his whistle — City played Liverpool at their own game.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Silva’s shift is the most exhausting in the Premier League this season and Graeme Souness, no stranger to a scrap as a player, lauded the intensity. ‘The energy expended in the opening 45 minutes was like the normal 90 in a Premier League game,’ he said. And while we have come to expect that from Klopp’s Liverpool, this was new from a Guardiola team. </p><video preload="none" id="1834684" title="Managers reflect on title race after Man City beat Liverpool" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/04/07/video-8118300-826_636x358.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/01/04/4645305416223379065/1024x576_MP4_4645305416223379065.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/04/19/8140108-6558799-image-a-15_1546631022926.jpg" height="453" width="634" alt="Both Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp had been engaging in mind games before the match" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not that City do not work hard. Guardiola’s demands and professional fervour are well known. He focusses tirelessly on recovering possession in training, and brooks no compromise on fitness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Guardiola arrived, Yaya Toure spent weeks in the gym before even being let near a first-team training session. He had a playing weight Guardiola needed him to hit and, until then, was on the outside. So there have always been high standards. This, however, was different. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here was Guardiola sacrificing some of the finesse for fierceness, almost conforming to the expectation of a blood and thunder tear-up — the wild, untamed creature that makes England’s domestic competition unique. Perhaps that is why many of the world’s most gifted coaches want to work here.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For, with 20 of the 28 players involved and both managers hailing from outside the British Isles, Manchester City and Liverpool delivered a game that felt wholly English in its ferocity. And Guardiola bought into that from the kick-off — indeed from a distance out, given what he said about the challenge in preparation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He knew the importance of the win, he knew when to step it up, he knew when to compromise those mighty principles. That’s how a man goes close to 12 years with his record.

He adds: ‘I would like to personally assure you that I am committed to conclude our deal as soon as possible … we are both perhaps frustrated that we have not progressed as quickly as we would have wished.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ashley is coming under increasing pressure to sell, with eight fans’ groups writing a joint letter this week imploring him to conclude any deal swiftly, or invest transfer funds in the January window. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There has been increasing scepticism on Tyneside that talk of selling is merely a ruse by the owner to quell growing protests. A television interview that Ashley gave recently has been dismissed as a PR exercise to get the fans off his back, with claims that he is resistant to any sale. </p><video preload="none" id="1775534" title="Newcastle owner Mike Ashley faces protests at dinner with Rafa Benitez" poster="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/10/04/01/4749320-0-image-a-5_1538614479663.jpg"><source src="https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2018/10/04/157142476746767713/1024x576_MP4_157142476746767713.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source></video><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/04/18/8138682-0-image-a-73_1546627831495.jpg" height="392" width="634" alt="Rafa Benitez's Newcastle side are just two points off the relegation places in the table" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were reports before Christmas that Kenyon’s consortium, which includes former Manchester City chief executive Garry Cook, were as much as one-third short of the asking price — a figure in the region of £100m. Yet what also emerges from Kenyon’s letter is that negotiations are long-standing and he remains Ashley’s preferred bidder. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While not yet at an exclusivity stage, Kenyon certainly appears to have progressed further than a previous suitor, Amanda Staveley, whose takeover Ashley ultimately dismissed as ‘a waste of time’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In contrast, Kenyon writes: ‘I am delighted you think the investor group led by myself is the best fit. We have both spent many months discussing the parameters of a final deal…and have also invested heavily in time and money on our various legal and financial advisors.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kenyon concludes by thanking Ashley for his patience, with a hope for further negotiations in the new year. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The problem, once again, is in the timing. If Kenyon’s deal cannot be completed before the January transfer window closes — and, for all the good intentions, there is nothing in the letter to suggest it will be — this still leaves Newcastle in limbo, with Ashley unlikely to invest further if he is selling, and any new investor unable to raise sufficient funds in time to make the necessary short-term impact. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Newcastle are just two points off the relegation places and the biggest fear is that the manager, Rafa Benitez, will tire of the process before either Ashley or Kenyon and make up his mind to leave in the summer. </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>EXCLUSIVE: Peter Kenyon’s bid to buy Newcastle is not over, and he has contacted Mike Ashley personally with a promise to resume negotiations this month.

Along the goal line, in at the left post. Ladies and gentlemen, we have what is known as a title race. And a proper one, now the head-to-head meetings of these teams are done. Match by match, weekend by weekend, they will fight each other by proxy around the grounds. Maybe Tottenham will chip in, too. It should be grand entertainment. Buckle up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Manchester City are right back in it and deservedly so. They shaded this even if it was an unconventional performance from a Pep Guardiola side, more blood and thunder than tiki-taka. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The dying minutes of the match even found him channelling his inner Klopp, imploring, gesturing to the crowd to make more noise and get behind the team as they regrouped to repel a fresh barrage of Liverpool long balls. When the danger finally passed, and a goal kick was awarded, there was none of that highbrow playing out to the full-back. Ten blue shirts headed upfield and Guardiola ordered Ederson to kick as long as he could. And that man can kick.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/21/8103654-6555455-image-a-77_1546551382414.jpg" height="563" width="962" alt="Leroy Sane put the home side in front with less than 20 minutes to play with a low-drilled shot that cannoned off the post" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/21/8103852-6555455-image-a-83_1546551670476.jpg" height="616" width="962" alt="The German winger curved the ball past the helpless Alisson and the ball rebounded off the post and into the back of the net" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/21/8103858-6555455-image-a-79_1546551665022.jpg" height="630" width="962" alt="Sane's winner helped Manchester City close the gap on league leaders Liverpool to four points at the top of the table" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox sport" data-version="2" id="mol-7cad9b40-0faa-11e9-a80f-53d10dc9d2d2">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">MATCH FACTS, LIVE LEAGUE TABLE AND MATCH ZONE </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <div class="cleared row mol-cols mol-cols-3" id="mol-7cade960-0faa-11e9-a80f-53d10dc9d2d2">                            <div class="mol-col span4 mol-col-1" style="style">                                <div class="cleared mol-col-content"><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Manchester City (4-3-3):</strong> Ederson 8, Stones 6, Kompany 8 (Otamendi 88), Laporte 7 (Walker 86), Danilo 7, Bernardo Silva 8, Fernandinho 9, Silva 7 (Gundogan 65, 6), Sterling 7, Aguero 8.5, Sane 9.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Subs not used:</strong> De Bruyne, Mahrez, Gabriel Jesus, Muric.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Manager:</strong> Pep Guardiola 9 </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Goals:</strong> Aguero 40, Sane 72</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Booked:</strong> Kompany, Laporte, Bernardo Silva, Ederson.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Liverpool (4-3-3):</strong> Alisson 8, Alexander-Arnold 8, Lovren 6, Van Dijk 8.5, Robertson 8, Wijnaldum 6 (Sturridge 86), Henderson 6, Milner 6 (Fabinho 57, 6), Salah 7, Firmino 7, Mane 7 (Shaqiri 77).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Subs not used:</strong> Keita, Moreno, Lallana, Mignolet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Manager:</strong> Jurgen Klopp 7</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Goals:</strong> Firmino 64</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Booked:</strong> Lovren, Wijnaldum.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Referee:</strong> Anthony Taylor 7.5</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Attendance:</strong> 55,000 </p>                                </div>                            </div><div class="mol-col span4 mol-col-2" style="style">                                <div class="cleared mol-col-content">                                    </div>                            </div><div class="mol-col span4 mol-col-3" style="style"> <div class="cleared mol-col-content"> <img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/23/8107210-6555455-image-a-6_1546557263903.jpg" height="573" width="296" alt="Sergio Aguero broke the deadlock just before the interval with a powerful near-post strike that beat Alisson.

They continue to look the best team in it, even if Thursday night’s display was uncharacteristically skittish in moments, with passes going astray and nerves apparent. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet this may have dented their confidence and means they cannot afford to tinker greatly with their domestic selections, even when the Champions League reconvenes. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for City, this is a huge fillip, with another to come. The presence of Kevin De Bruyne on the substitutes bench suggests they are very close to naming the triumvirate of KDB, Fernandinho and David Silva in midfield again; a threesome almost as vital as Liverpool’s Mo Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Others will be brimming with confidence again, after recent setbacks, too – not least matchwinner Leroy Sane. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just at the point when Liverpool looked to have triumphed – not with victory, but with the draw that would keep City at arm’s length – he intervened. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As it stood, with the score at 1-1, Liverpool were on course to maintain their seven point advantage. Seven points is a hefty margin, even in January. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would require City to stay unbeaten and Liverpool to lose two, maybe three games when they were yet to surrender one, coming here. Sane cut a hole in that safety net after 71 minutes, slicing Liverpool’s lead to four points. Still a decent gap but far from comfortable. All it might take is the odd slip or two. And Thursday night was a slip, have no doubt of it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Liverpool were second best for much of the game but, having equalised, they looked capable of holding out. It was then that Raheem Sterling ran the ball crossfield and picked out his team-mate, Sane. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He made a good angle, saw the opportunity open up and struck a low left foot shot towards the farthest corner. He could not have been more precise. It was a winner worthy of the occasion. City’s performance was worthy, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, they remain defensively vulnerable. Liverpool’s equaliser was a classic example of the frailty that has left Guardiola’s champions playing catch-up this season.  </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/21/8103538-6555455-image-a-73_1546551170578.jpg" height="434" width="962" alt="Liverpool forward Roberto Firmino equalised just after the hour mark with a header into an empty net" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/21/8103294-6555455-image-a-68_1546551153223.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="An excellent Trent Alexander-Arnold long pass found Andy Robertson who crossed the ball to the Brazil international" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/21/8103566-6555455-image-a-76_1546551242321.jpg" height="616" width="962" alt="Firmino celebrated with Mohamed Salah as the Reds managed to get back into the game at the Etihad " /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/04/00/8109708-6555455-image-a-20_1546562882792.jpg" height="474" width="470" alt="" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">A deep cross from Trent Alexander-Arnold should have been comfortably dealt with at the far post. Instead, Danilo got trapped underneath it, Andrew Robertson played a chip across the six-yard box and Firmino headed it into an empty net, because Sterling had not spotted his movement. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then, late in the game, Salah had a shot saved by Ederson, and Guardiola nearly talked himself into a seat in the main stand protesting what he considered a push by Jordan Henderson on John Stones in the build-up. He was sent off here when the teams last met in the Champions League, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet, not for the first time on the night, referee Anthony Taylor indulged and City prevailed. They got away with one in the first half as well in a brief spell that changed the match, and maybe the title race, too.  </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/20/8102044-6555455-image-a-51_1546548317513.jpg" height="610" width="962" alt="Sergio Aguero broke the deadlock when the Argentine got ahead of Dejan Lovren who was caught sleeping at his near post" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/20/8102074-6555455-image-a-55_1546548471241.jpg" height="592" width="962" alt="The Argentina international smashed the ball into the roof of the net past Liverpool's goalkeeper Alisson" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/21/8103480-6555455-image-a-66_1546551043528.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Aguero opened the scoring just before the break and this was his 250th Premier League goal for Manchester City" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/04/00/8109706-6555455-image-a-28_1546562966160.jpg" height="972" width="470" alt="" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the 18th minute, Liverpool got an excellent chance against the run of play. Salah slipped the ball through to Mane who was left one on one with goalkeeper Ederson. He finished low, but the ball struck the inside of a post and came out. Stones reached it first and in his haste to clear, did not notice Ederson recovering to smother the danger. He tried to smash it away, but found Ederson rather than clear air and suddenly the ball was heading back towards his own goal. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stones cleared it off the line, technology showed, by a sliver. A good delicatessen couldn’t slice salami much thinner. Without assistance, we would still be debating it; and the linesman would have been left guessing, and making a 50-50 call; probably the wrong one given that to the naked eye, it looked over. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Technology doesn’t yet rule elsewhere on the field, and City will be thankful for that. Not long after, Stones played a careless, loose ball to Vincent Kompany who found himself in a 45-55 with Salah, deep in City’s half. Had he lost it, there was the opener. So he lunged. He took the ball, but the Liverpool man, too; no way was he in control. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It could easily have been a red card, but Taylor seemed motivated by the strange imperative that overtakes English referees on nights like this: he didn’t want to spoil the occasion. Yellow it was and City’s captain remained. Was the match better for it? Of course. Was justice done in that moment? Probably not.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So City’s first goal was vital, much like the man who scored it. Since the start of the 2011-12 season, Sergio Aguero has scored 37 league goals against the ‘big six’ clubs. To put that into perspective, Harry Kane has 21. Aguero has also scored in all seven games he has played, at home, against Liverpool. Yet little is routine with him. This, once again, was the epitome of the goalscorer’s art. Intelligence, wit, accuracy.

And Aguero had the answer to that: play against Dejan Lovren instead. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He improvised brilliantly in the build-up. The merest touch from Van Dijk as the pair jostled for a cross sent Aguero to ground, appealing for a penalty. Referee Taylor was having none of it, so Aguero had an even better idea. He stayed down, in protest, as the ball was cleared and carried around the perimeter of the penalty area by Bernardo Silva. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Only then did Aguero rise as Silva moved into position to recycle. Now he had lost Van Dijk, busy elsewhere, and was up against Lovren when the cross was delivered. He held it up, turned the Croatian – who is a good defender, but never quite the rock he plainly believes – and fired a shot past Alisson into the roof of the net.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since three points for a win was introduced in 1981-82, every team with 52 points or more after 21 games has won the league. Liverpool have 54. Yet, each of those front-runners has led the league by a minimum of five points or more after 21 games, too. Liverpool are just four clear, having dropped nine all season. Now that’s what you call a title race. </p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/20/8101462-6555455-image-a-35_1546547174711.jpg" height="582" width="962" alt="The ball deflected off Ederson and flew in the direction of the City goal and it was nearly a comical own goal" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/20/8101466-6555455-image-a-37_1546547179740.jpg" height="571" width="962" alt="Stones managed to recover and clear the ball off the line with goal-line technology showing the ball had not crossed the line" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/20/8101814-6555455-image-a-45_1546547843649.jpg" height="635" width="962" alt="City captain Vincent Kompany was lucky not to be sent off after leaving the ground when tackling Mohamed Salah" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/20/8101856-6555455-image-a-47_1546547927805.jpg" height="677" width="962" alt="The Belgium international was only shown a yellow card by referee Anthony Taylor while Salah rolled on the floor in agony" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/20/8101722-6555455-image-a-42_1546547718777.jpg" height="637" width="962" alt="Liverpool defender Lovren (right) hacked down Aguero (left) and received a yellow card from the referee" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/20/8101360-6555455-image-a-27_1546546864699.jpg" height="602" width="962" alt="It was a fast start at the Etihad and there were plenty of strong tackles in the early exchanges on Thursday evening" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/20/8101362-6555455-image-a-28_1546546867157.jpg" height="596" width="962" alt="Manchester City's combative midfielder Fernandinho collided with Andrew Robertson leaving the Scot on the floor" /><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/20/8101506-6555455-image-a-41_1546547303935.jpg" height="665" width="962" alt="Liverpool legends Kenny Dalglish and Ian Rush were in attendance at the Etihad Stadium on Thursday evening" />]]></content:encoded><dc:description>MARTIN SAMUEL AT THE ETIHAD STADIUM: Off it came, from the inside of the right post. Along the goal line, in at the left post. Ladies and gentlemen, we have what is known as a title race. And a proper one, now the head-to-head meetings of these teams are done. Match by match, weekend by weekend, they will fight each other by proxy around the grounds. Maybe Tottenham will chip in, too. It should be grand entertainment. Buckle up. Manchester City are right back in it and deservedly so. They shaded this even if it was an unconventional performance from a Pep Guardiola side, more blood and thunder than tiki-taka.  The dying minutes of the match even found him channelling his inner Klopp, imploring, gesturing to the crowd to make more noise and get behind the team as they regrouped to repel a fresh barrage of Liverpool long balls. When the danger finally passed, and a goal kick was awarded, there was none of that highbrow playing out to the full-back. Ten blue shirts headed upfield and Guardiola ordered Ederson to kick as long as he could. And that man can kick.</dc:description><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Martin Samuel for the Daily Mail</dc:creator><dcterms:modified>2019-01-04T00:50:50.000Z</dcterms:modified><mi:shortTitle>Leroy Sane helps Pep Guardiola's side close the gap to four points</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2019-01-04T00:50:50.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Mohamed Salah,Liverpool,Pep Guardiola,Ederson Moraes,Raheem Sterling,Jurgen Klopp,Sergio Aguero,Manchester City,Premier League</media:keywords><media:content url="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/03/23/8107038-0-image-a-4_1546556729382.jpg"><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6555085/Manchester-City-face-heaviest-punishment-UEFA.html" title="Manchester City could face 'heaviest punishment' of Champions League ban if found guilty of a further breach of Financial Fair Play regulations"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6555029/Manchester-City-vs-Liverpool-LIVE-score-line-ups-updates-Premier-League-title-race-heats-up.html" title="Manchester City 2-1 Liverpool, RESULT score – Relive the action as Premier League title rivals collide in nail-biting showdown at the Etihad Stadium"></atom:link><atom:link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6552305/Mohamed-Salah-Sergio-Aguero-Virgil-van-Dijk-makes-combined-Manchester-City-Liverpool-XI.html" title="Raheem Sterling or Sadio Mane?

In 2019, we will see the most radical changes to the Rules of Golf for more than 60 years. In come a whole raft of sensible measures that fit the modern game.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here are the 10 changes that are going to make the biggest difference to your playing and viewing experience.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/24/14/7791886-6527047-image-m-98_1545662791684.jpg" height="716" width="634" alt="No fan of the old rulebook, Rory McIlroy will be looking forward to the changes for 2019" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>1. REPAIRING SPIKE MARKS BEFORE PUTTING</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some players' careers never recovered from seeking to avoid putting over a spike mark (by marking the ball incorrectly, for example) — and being found out. Now, they will be allowed to repair any damage on the green before putting. Clearly, being permitted to do something that was once considered unpardonable, like tapping down a spike mark, might take some getting used to for the professionals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This is one of those areas where we're trying to reflect the modern game,' Grant Moir, Director of Rules for the R&amp;A, explained. 'The putting surfaces are presented to such a high standard these days with the consequent level of expectation that it feels right that players should be able to repair any damage before putting. We think this change will work well.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. PUTTING WITH THE FLAGSTICK STILL IN PLACE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It used to be a two shot penalty if you hit the flag while putting from on the green. Now, in an effort to speed up play, you don't have to wait for someone to attend the flagstick if you are a long way from the hole, as there's no longer any infringement if you do hit the flag. Will the pros seek to take advantage, on those fast, slippery downhill putts where hitting the flag might stop the ball from going a long way past?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Said Moir: 'We're aware this might happen, but we feel for the good of the game as a whole this change is a huge positive.'<strong></strong></p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/24/14/7791960-6527047-image-a-102_1545662908775.jpg" height="705" width="634" alt="Hitting the flagstick (r) will no longer incur a two-shot penalty under the new rules" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>3. DROPPING THE BALL FROM KNEE RATHER THAN SHOULDER HEIGHT</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This will be one of the most significant changes,' said Moir. 'We've gone with this new rule where the ball has to be dropped within one or two club lengths when taking relief from a penalty area (the new term for all hazards), and to try to ensure this happens on the first drop, the ball will now be dropped from knee height. The old rule was far too complex for most players and this should simplify the procedure.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4. NO PENALTY FOR A DOUBLE HIT</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps the only thing worse than chunking a chip and inadvertently hitting the ball for a second time on your follow through was the resultant two shot penalty.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Talk about clobbering a player when they're down. Mercifully, this will change in 2019.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'One of the things we were keen to move away from was penalties for accidentally deflecting a ball, and this falls firmly in that category,' said Moir.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>5. READY TO PLAY</strong></strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How many times have you stood on the tee and felt frustrated as the player whose honour it is to play first marks their scorecard and generally faffs about while you're ready? In 2019, the honour lies with the player ready to tee off, not the one who had the lowest score on the previous hole.</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/24/14/7792096-6527047-image-a-104_1545663149760.jpg" height="451" width="634" alt="In 2019, the player who is ready tees off, not the one with the lowest score on the previous hole" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>6. NO PENALTY FOR ACCIDENTALLY MOVING A BALL WHILE LOOKING FOR IT</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another nonsensical regulation discarded to the dustbin of history. You're looking for a ball in the thick rough and you get penalized one shot because you happened to inadvertently kick it? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This is inappropriate,' said Moir. 'Now, using their best estimate, players need to replace the ball in the spot where the ball was found. If they couldn't see it when they accidentally moved it, for example, it should still be difficult to see when they've replaced it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>7. NO PENALTY FOR INADVERTENTLY MOVING A LOOSE IMPEDIMENT IN A PENALTY AREA </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brian Davis must have allowed himself a wry smile at this change. The Londoner was once denied a first victory on the PGA Tour after calling a two shot penalty on himself for disturbing a reed whilst attempting to play from a water hazard during a play-off for the 2010 Heritage Classic against Jim Furyk. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There will be a few players feeling like that,' said Moir. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We felt it didn't make sense that different circumstances applied just because you were the wrong side of a red penalty line. Now, you can play the same shot if you are standing inside a penalty area as outside it.'</p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/24/14/7791916-6527047-image-a-100_1545662809992.jpg" height="396" width="634" alt="Brian Davis (r) lost a play-off to Jim Furyk after a two-shot penalty for disturbing a reed in 2010" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>8. RELAXED BUNKER RULES</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We felt it was important to maintain the challenge of playing from a bunker, so players will still be required to hover the club behind the ball and not ground it,' said Moir. 'What we wanted to get away from was the raft of accidental penalties, so you can remove loose impediments that might be in your way.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>9. TIME LIMIT OF THREE MINUTES INSTEAD OF FIVE WHEN LOOKING FOR A BALL</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong> </strong>Another measure designed to help speed up the game.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>10. RELYING ON PLAYER INTEGRITY</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We've seen all hell let loose when video replays later show that a player got it wrong estimating where a ball entered a water hazard, and so the spot where they could drop under penalty. Now, getting it wrong by a reasonable amount will be forgivable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The rules have always relied on the honesty of players, but what we were keen to move away from was this detailed analysis later on of what they've done, where perhaps an unfair burden is placed on them,' said Moir. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If it can reasonably be shown that a player has made an honest assessment of where a ball entered a penalty area, and it was later shown they got it slightly wrong, we're not going to penalise in that situation.'</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:description>DEREK LAWRENSON: They were the most arcane set of rules governing any sport, so impenetrable and lacking in common sense it was hardly surprising that even the world’s finest were frequently caught out.
