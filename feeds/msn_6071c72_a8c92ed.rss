Newlyweds Nathan and Tasha Stewart were horrified to discover that their leasehold agreement has a clause which means the ground rent doubles every decade.

But when they tried to sell up in October last year, 27-year-old marketing manager Nathan came across the game-changing clause.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Phoebe Southworth</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-21T19:50:52.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Leasehold clause is trapping newlyweds in house they want to sell</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-21T19:50:52.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/15/486773E000000578-0-image-a-34_1516547822854.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/15/48637D9200000578-0-image-a-35_1516547825193.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5296005/Gran-strangled-daughters-killer-denied-compensation.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Grandmother, 81, who was strangled and left for dead by the man who'd just raped and murdered her daughter is denied compensation because her injuries were not severe enough"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5245127/Britons-bombarded-2-2bn-nuisance-phone-calls.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Britons were bombarded with 2.2 billion nuisance phone calls and texts last year - that's 4,200 a MINUTE "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5200525/Law-ban-practice-exploiting-home-buyers-announced.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Rip-off leases on new houses are banned: Law to ban 'feudal' practice that exploits buyers to be announced by Sajid Javid"></link></item><item><title>Sparkle is the new black!

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Both pupils at Thomas Mills High School in rural Suffolk stood out for their exceptional talent — in very different fields.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/ed_sheeran/index.html">Edward Sheeran</a>, an awkward-looking boy with a mop of orange hair, had obvious musical ability and was a terrific singer; pretty brunette Cherry Seaborn, in the class below him, was an ace on the hockey field.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pair developed a close friendship during their time at school, and some said that Ed had a crush on Cherry — although she had a boyfriend. Then life intervened and they went their separate ways. Cherry earned a degree in molecular biology and represented England in the Under-21 hockey team. She now works as a senior consultant in risk advisory at prestigious accounting firm Deloitte.</p><img id="i-3c748ac2b9983dea" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/23/485A784200000578-5295607-image-a-4_1516578098148.jpg" height="1011" width="634" alt="Ed Sheeran and Cherry Seaborn developed a close friendship during their time at school in Framlingham, Suffolk, and some said that Ed had a crush on her -although she had a boyfriend" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile Ed, as everyone knows, achieved success in a rather more glamorous field soon after leaving school in the small town of Framlingham. His songs have sold in their millions and his third album, Divide, went straight to No 1 upon its release last March.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Forbes magazine estimates that in 2015 alone he made £40 million. Money and fame, however, have not made him happy, and in one recent interview he spoke about how he shut himself up in his London home for four months, struggling to cope with the pressures of his celebrity. So it’s somehow fitting, as well as romantic, that he found his way back to his teenage crush, the sporty Cherry Seaborn.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As he wrote in his song Perfect, said to be about her: ‘We were just kids when we fell in love / Not knowing what it was / I will not give you up this time’.</p><img id="i-2406ac995fb1eb67" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/00/486A791300000578-5295607-Cherry_Seaborn_in_the_class_below_Ed_Sheeran_at_Thomas_Mills_Hig-a-4_1516579320390.jpg" height="785" width="634" alt="Cherry Seaborn, in the class below Ed Sheeran at Thomas Mills High School, was an ace on the hockey field." class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-70cad3539c033a60" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/00/485A192900000578-5295607-Ed_posted_an_Instagram_announcing_the_engagement_saying_Got_myse-a-3_1516579296950.jpg" height="603" width="634" alt="Ed posted an Instagram announcing the engagement, saying: ‘Got myself a fiancé just before new year.

The announcement was accompanied by a touching photograph of 26-year-old Ed with his arms around Cherry, planting a kiss on her cheek.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No details of the wedding have been forthcoming, but it’s possible it will be held in the Framlingham area, where Ed has a property and where both families have roots. Ed’s parents still live in the town, and Cherry’s are about ten miles away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to one showbusiness source, Sheeran is believed to have turned down £3 million from the magazine Us Weekly to cover the nuptials. The couple instead plan on a relatively ‘low key’ event, with not many celebs — although Ed’s close friend, pop star Taylor Swift, is likely to be an exception.</p><video controls="controls" class="video-js vjs-default-skin" data-opts="{&quot;linkBaseURL&quot;:&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5295607/The-jolly-hockey-sticks-girl-marrying-Ed-Sheeran.html#v-4384172627645777861&quot;,&quot;isMobile&quot;:false,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2018/01/21/4384172627645777861/1024x576_MP4_4384172627645777861.mp4&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;ITN&quot;,&quot;playerId&quot;:&quot;default&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Ed Sheeran gets engaged to his girlfriend, Cherry Seaborn&quot;,&quot;preload&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;initialVideo&quot;:true,&quot;thumbnail&quot;:&quot;http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/19/4869ACA200000578-0-image-a-14_1516561739181.jpg&quot;,&quot;poster&quot;:&quot;http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/19/4869ACA200000578-0-image-a-13_1516561737772.jpg&quot;,&quot;syndicationService&quot;:null,&quot;plugins&quot;:{&quot;social-share&quot;:{&quot;embedUrl&quot;:&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/embed/video/1611990.html&quot;},&quot;autoplay-next-video&quot;:{&quot;videos&quot;:&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/api/player/1611990/related-videos.json&quot;,&quot;countdown_time&quot;:10},&quot;ads-setup&quot;:{&quot;videoAdServerUrl&quot;:&quot;http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=[size]&amp;iu=%2F5765%2Fdm.video%2Fdm_video_homehp&amp;ciu_szs=&amp;impl=s&amp;gdfp_req=1&amp;env=vp&amp;output=xml_vast3&amp;unviewed_position_start=1&amp;url=[referrer_url]&amp;correlator=[timestamp]&quot;,&quot;adsEnabled&quot;:true,&quot;adsCancelTimeout&quot;:15000,&quot;screen&quot;:{&quot;width&quot;:636,&quot;height&quot;:358}},&quot;sources&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/api/player/4384172627645777861/video-sources.json&quot;},&quot;flyout&quot;:{&quot;viewportOffset&quot;:0.4,&quot;switchBack&quot;:true,&quot;forceFlyout&quot;:{&quot;active&quot;:false,&quot;muted&quot;:true,&quot;switchBack&quot;:false}},&quot;tracking&quot;:{&quot;channelShortName&quot;:&quot;tvshowbiz&quot;,&quot;sponsored&quot;:null,&quot;referenceId&quot;:1611990,&quot;trackingType&quot;:&quot;embedded&quot;},&quot;autoplay-inline&quot;:{&quot;enabled&quot;:false},&quot;related-videos&quot;:{&quot;videos&quot;:&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/api/player/1611990/related-videos.json&quot;}},&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;4384172627645777861&quot;,&quot;descr&quot;:&quot;Ed Sheeran has become engaged to his girlfriend, Cherry Seaborn.

Its romantic lyrics (‘I’ll be taking my time, spending my life / Falling deeper in love with you’) suggest he was thinking about the long term early in their relationship.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an interview in February last year, he said the song had been written some time previously, explaining: ‘I said to my girlfriend, “What’s your favourite song on the album?” She said: “You’ve forgotten it existed and I have it in my email because I’m the only one you sent it to.” So she picked it out from like, a year-and-a-half ago and I ended up recording it.’</p><img id="i-aa85e6d0ec63e5ba" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/23/486A792000000578-5295607-image-m-10_1516578237115.jpg" height="570" width="634" alt="Cherry completed her science degree at Durham University, then travelled to America to take a qualification at the Master of Management Studies programme at Duke University in North Carolina (pictured: Cherry Seaborn as a child)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, who is Cherry Seaborn? She grew up in a charming period property in a village outside Framlingham with her mother Ann, father Matthew, an architect, and younger brother. Charlie is in the same business as his brother-in-law-to-be, writing film and theatre music.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While Cherry was one of those lovely, grounded girls who is friends with everyone, young Ed was a bit of an awkward teenager. ‘I was quite a weird kid when I was little,’ he said. ‘I wore big glasses, had hearing problems, had a stutter and I had ginger hair.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He lived with mum and dad, Imogen and John, and brother Matthew, in Framlingham, but dropped out of school at 16 to seek his fortune as a singer. At the outset he busked and slept rough under an arch near Buckingham Palace.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cherry took a more orthodox route to success. After completing her science degree at Durham University, she travelled to America to take a qualification at the Master of Management Studies programme at Duke University in North Carolina. This allowed her to pursue her passion for hockey as part of the university’s prestigious Blue Devils hockey team.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mark Barreca, whose daughter Hannah played with her, said: ‘Cherry is a wonderful young lady, really nice and a great hockey player. Ed Sheeran is a lucky guy.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hockey was a big part of Cherry’s life at Duke, and she gave some insight into her personality when she spoke to the university magazine. ‘I’m a massive team player,’ she said. ‘I don’t really do it for myself, the thing I like the most is being a part of something that’s bigger than just you and that you can give something that makes other people happy and makes other people succeed.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the summer of 2015, she was still in America when Ed visited the country. Coincidentally, it was around this time he had been in the doldrums about fame and the lack of freedom that came with it.</p><img id="i-710f1dbee4cbfea4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/00/485A1B0C00000578-5295607-_Cherry_is_a_wonderful_young_lady_really_nice_and_a_great_hockey-a-30_1516582796882.jpg" height="935" width="634" alt="'Cherry is a wonderful young lady, really nice and a great hockey player. Ed Sheeran is a lucky guy': Mark Barreca, whose daughter Hannah played hockey with Cherry, praised the 25-year-old" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an interview last year, he said: ‘I stayed inside for four months. I watched movies. I couldn’t just go out and get a pint of milk. I always wanted to maintain normality. I was ordering takeaways and putting on a lot of weight.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was recovering, also, from the breakdown of his relationship in the February that year with Athina Andrelos, who works as a manager for Jamie Oliver’s food company. The couple had been photographed on yachts in various exotic locations, living the sort of life expected of a pop star — but all the sunning and fun didn’t suit Ed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2013, a fling with singer Ellie Goulding, similarly a British pop sensation lauded for her songwriting, had also come to nothing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And so Ed was keen to reconnect with friends from the old days. He and Cherry got in touch, and soon the pair were being spotted out and about at baseball matches and suchlike.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the U.S., he was probably more able to go about his business without being mobbed by fans, giving the relationship time to blossom.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last year Ed said in an interview: ‘This has been the first time I’ve ever actually had the time to fall in love properly. I’ve always got into relationships very passionately — I’m a redhead and also Irish.</p><img id="i-9734cd306f38967" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/00/485A7B0700000578-5295607-Ed_and_his_fianc_e_are_clearly_besotted_although_they_seem_like_-a-29_1516582796546.jpg" height="955" width="634" alt="Ed and his fiancée are clearly besotted, although they seem like chalk and cheese.

  </video><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I’m ready, let’s go — tour bus babies, little fat, chubby babies that just walk around,’ he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2016, the pair went off travelling for five months. They visited Japan, New Zealand and Ghana before heading to Iceland to see the Northern Lights. While there, Ed had a horrifying mishap when he put his foot in a boiling geyser, which melted the skin off his foot. ‘I had to get choppered out. I missed the Northern Lights as I was in hospital,’ he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the pair returned, Cherry took up her position at Deloitte in London. Early last year she joined a hockey club in South London.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cherry’s addition to the team has been quite exciting for anyone who likes both hockey and Ed Sheeran — he has been seen cheering on the sidelines at one or two matches.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The couple are believed to have been living together for about a year — Ed has a property in London, too. They’ve been spotted once or twice browsing around Portobello Road Market, but tend to shun celebrity parties.</p><img id="i-c1d73fdbbff8e66e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/00/485A1B1C00000578-5295607-No_details_of_the_wedding_have_been_forthcoming_but_it_s_possibl-a-31_1516582799864.jpg" height="947" width="634" alt="No details of the wedding have been forthcoming, but it’s possible it will be held in the Framlingham area, where Ed has a property and where both families have roots" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The only time they could have been accused of courting attention is when they arrived at presenter Jonathan Ross’s house for a Halloween party last year in matching pink coats and hats.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cherry’s stabilising influence is undoubtedly good for Ed. He’s accident prone; he once accidentally smashed a bottle of beer into his hand and the stitches split open while he was playing guitar.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Recently, he told of how Cherry had to nurse him after a bike accident last October. She even ‘had to brush my teeth’, he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are other troubles she may have helped him through, too. He has been embroiled in a stressful legal suit with songwriters for the track Amazing sung by X Factor winner Matt Cardle, who claimed he had copied the song ‘note for note’ for his hit song, Photograph. A $20 million lawsuit (£13.8 million) was launched against Sheeran. The case was settled last April; no details were released.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But all this, and solitary nights at home consoling himself with pizza, is behind him. Cherry’s sports regimen has rubbed off a little on Ed. In an interview last year, he revealed he has started doing exercise — ten minutes a day, ‘intervals of 30 seconds sprinting and 30 jogging’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sheeran is currently in the midst of a world tour so when he and Cherry will fit in the wedding is anyone’s guess. His lucky number is 17 and Cherry’s is 19, so perhaps it will be on the 17th or the 19th of an upcoming month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ed has said he would like to send his children to his school, Thomas Mills. He has a tattoo of its emblem above his belly button.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So who would bet against the happy couple ending up settling back in Framlingham, living quietly in the country — and, with the small exception of his vast wealth and fame, enjoying a life almost like the old days?</p>]]></body><dc:abstract>Ed Sheeran and Cherry Seaborn (pictured together on the left) developed a close friendship during their time at school in Framlingham, Suffolk, and some said that Ed (pictured as a child inset left) had a crush on her pictured as a child inset right) - although she had a boyfriend. Then life intervened and they went their separate ways. Cherry earned a degree in molecular biology and represented England in the Under-21 hockey team.

The award-winning actress explained that she turned 12 on the set of her first film, 'The Professional,' in which she played a young girl who made friends with a hit man in hopes of avenging her parents' murders.  When the movie was released a year later, she said she was excited to open her first fan letter. But inside the letter a man had written to her about a 'rape fantasy' he had about her.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Abigail Miller</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-21T15:23:29.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Natalie Portman says she experienced 'sexual terrorism' at 13</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-21T15:23:29.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/02/4861118E00000578-0-image-a-15_1516501761948.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/02/485FFC2B00000578-0-image-a-66_1516502949516.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1534998</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Vince Flores/startraksphoto.com</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5292295/Womens-March-anniversary-Trumps-inauguration.html?ito=rss_msn" title="'A perfect day for all women to march!'
