<p class="mol-para-with-font">It has been four months since Megyn Kelly earned the wrath and ire of Jane Fonda for asking the 80-year-old actress about her plastic surgery, and the NBC host is now responding to the backlash.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That moment occurred during Kelly's third episode on September 27 when she asked the Oscar-winner about what work she had done in the past, which prompted a steely Fonda to stare Kelly down and ask: 'We really want to talk about that now?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since then Fonda has complained about the question to a number of outlets, and even mocked Kelly's question on Today last week during an interview with Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When she first complained publicly after the program, and repeatedly, I chose to say nothing, as my general philosophy is what other people think of me is none of my business,' said Megyn at the end of her program on Monday. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'However, Fonda was at it again last week, including right here on NBC, and then again elsewhere.

  </video><p class="mol-para-with-font">'First, some context. Fonda was on to promote a film about aging. For years she has spoken openly about her joy in giving a cultural face to older women,' Kelly told her studio audience.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Well the truth is most older women look nothing like Fonda, who is now 80. And if Fonda really wants to have an honest discussion about older women's cultural face, then her plastic surgery is tough to ignore.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She continued: 'Fonda herself knows this. She knows this. And that is why, to her credit, she’s discussed her cosmetic surgery pretty much everywhere before coming on our show.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kelly went on to list the many outlets that Fonda has complained to along with the many outlets to which she has previously discussed her plastic surgery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today was one of them, with Lily Tomlin joking last week during an interview with Kotb and Guthrie about how long she had known Fonda by stating: 'Oh, my God…I think before your first facelift!' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fonda shot back: 'Who are you, Megyn Kelly?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the moment, all four women erupted in laughter, and the exchange was later posted on social media. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Jane Fonda had quite the response to Lily Tomlin's facelift question, read the caption. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kelly does not seem to be laughing however in the wake of that interview. </p><div class="mol-html" id="mol-8a361270-ff9c-11e7-b719-074218538f37">                            <div><div style="position:relative; padding-bottom:63%; padding-bottom:-webkit-calc(56.25% + 50px); padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 50px); height: 0;">    <iframe style="position:absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.today.com/offsite/megyn-kelly-i-have-no-regrets-about-my-question-to-jane-fonda-1142616131655" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe>  </div></div>                        </div><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Look, I gave her the chance to empower other women, young and old, on a subject which she purports to know well and she rejected it. That’s okay. But I have no regrets about the question,' explained Kelly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Nor am I in the market for a lesson from Jane Fonda on what is and is not appropriate. After all, this is a woman whose name is synonymous with outrage.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is when Kelly launched into Fox News mode. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Look at her treatment of our military during the Vietnam war, many of our veterans still call her "Hanoi Jane" thanks to her radio broadcasts which attempted to shame American troops. She posed on an anti-aircraft gun used to shoot down our pilots,' stated Kelly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'She called our POW's "hypocrites and liars" and referred to their torture as understandable. Even she had to apologize years later for that gun picture - but not for the rest of it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She then closed out by saying: 'By the way she still says she's not proud of America. So, the moral indignation is a little much. She put her plastic surgery out there. She said she wanted to discuss the plight of older women in America. And honestly she has no business lecturing anyone on what qualifies as offensive.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kelly's claim is inaccurate however, with Fonda apologizing directly to a group of Vietnam veterans in 2015 while appearing at an event in Maryland.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Whenever possible I try to sit down with vets and talk with them, because I understand and it makes me sad,' Fonda told those assembled at the Weinberg Center for Arts according to <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fredericknewspost.com/z/content_type/news_article/jane-fonda-met-with-protest-in-frederick-hopes-for-open/article_f76347a9-d99c-56d1-85a8-af1bc5432524.html">The Frederick News-Post</a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It hurts me and it will to my grave that I made a huge, huge mistake that made a lot of people think I was against the soldiers.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She later described herself as a 'lightening rod' to many, like to 50 protesters outside the venue that evening who carried signs reading: 'Forgive? Maybe. Forget? Never.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fonda then explained: 'This famous person goes and does something that looks like I’m against the troops, which wasn’t true, but it looked that way, and I’m a convenient target.

  </video><p class="mol-para-with-font">In what looked at the time to be an ill-advised and poorly conceived move, Kelly decided to ask the actress to detail the plastic surgery she has had done over the year back in September.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You, you've been an example to everyone, on how to age beautifully and with strength. And unapologetically,' began Kelly, nervously drawing out her question.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You admit you had work done. I think it's to your credit. You look amazing. Have you ... why did you say .. I read you felt you're not proud to admit you had work done, why not?' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is when Fonda asked why they were discussing the subject.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kelly tried her best to salvage the question, with Fonda at that point glancing over to her guest Robert Redford in disbelief that she was being asked that question while out promoting the pair's new film, 'Our Souls at Night.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Well, one of the things people think about when they look at you, is how amazing you look,' said Kelly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A composed-as-ever but noticeably chilly Fonda at that point demurred: 'Thanks. Good attitude. Good posture. Take care of myself.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She then took control of the interview from Kelly by telling the host: 'Let me tell you why I love this movie that we did, "Our Souls at Night," rather than plastic surgery.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Redford then looked at his co-star and showed his support for her by laughing and saying: 'Back to that, huh.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fonda then launched into her own talk about the film, no longer waiting or wanting to take one of Kelly's questions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You kind of have a choice in life, when you get to be close to 80, or even before then, what you want to do with your life. And my character, Addie, in this movie, she knows there's a lot more time behind her than in front,' explained Fonda.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And she doesn't want to go down lonely and scared. She's been a widow, living in this house by herself. And she's lonely and scared. And she's a shy person, who is not someone who would normally do this.

Fellow musician Ole Koretsky was in a relationship with the 46-year-old when she was found dead in a London hotel room last week. He was with Dolores' ex-husband Don Burton and their three children, who had all gathered for the service at Saint Alibe's Church in her hometown of Ballybricken in Ireland. Priest Liam McNamara today said her voice was worth its weight in gold and praised her for her 'excellent performance in her most important gig - life'. He also told the service how O'Riordan 'rescued countless people from the darkness of depression' with her music. The three remaining members of the band - Mike and Noel Hogan and Fergal Lawlor - all joined her mother Eileen and mourners carried her coffin following the poignant service.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>PA</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Wires</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-23T15:28:02.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Funeral mass of Dolores O´Riordan to take place</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-23T15:28:02.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Republic of Ireland</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/13/4880001B00000578-0-image-a-3_1516714735530.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/12/487F0E7E00000578-0-image-a-87_1516711928227.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1208279</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Getty Images</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5300793/Gas-leak-prompts-evacuation-London-s-West-End.html?ito=rss_msn" title="London's King's Cross and Charing Cross reopen after thousands of passengers were rerouted to three other stations following 2am gas leak"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5289335/TripAdvisor-reveals-best-hotels-world.html?ito=rss_msn" title="The best hotel in the world is in Cambodia and costs just £78 a night, according to the 2018 TripAdvisor Travellers’ Choice awards, with a Cotswolds B&amp;B named No1 in Europe"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5301085/Kylie-Minogue-Melissa-George-Paris-Fashion-Week.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Très chic!

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Both pupils at Thomas Mills High School in rural Suffolk stood out for their exceptional talent — in very different fields.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/ed_sheeran/index.html">Edward Sheeran</a>, an awkward-looking boy with a mop of orange hair, had obvious musical ability and was a terrific singer; pretty brunette Cherry Seaborn, in the class below him, was an ace on the hockey field.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pair developed a close friendship during their time at school, and some said that Ed had a crush on Cherry — although she had a boyfriend. Then life intervened and they went their separate ways. Cherry earned a degree in molecular biology and represented England in the Under-21 hockey team. She now works as a senior consultant in risk advisory at prestigious accounting firm Deloitte.</p><img id="i-3c748ac2b9983dea" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/23/485A784200000578-5295607-image-a-4_1516578098148.jpg" height="1011" width="634" alt="Ed Sheeran and Cherry Seaborn developed a close friendship during their time at school in Framlingham, Suffolk, and some said that Ed had a crush on her -although she had a boyfriend" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile Ed, as everyone knows, achieved success in a rather more glamorous field soon after leaving school in the small town of Framlingham. His songs have sold in their millions and his third album, Divide, went straight to No 1 upon its release last March.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Forbes magazine estimates that in 2015 alone he made £40 million. Money and fame, however, have not made him happy, and in one recent interview he spoke about how he shut himself up in his London home for four months, struggling to cope with the pressures of his celebrity. So it’s somehow fitting, as well as romantic, that he found his way back to his teenage crush, the sporty Cherry Seaborn.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As he wrote in his song Perfect, said to be about her: ‘We were just kids when we fell in love / Not knowing what it was / I will not give you up this time’.</p><img id="i-2406ac995fb1eb67" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/00/486A791300000578-5295607-Cherry_Seaborn_in_the_class_below_Ed_Sheeran_at_Thomas_Mills_Hig-a-4_1516579320390.jpg" height="785" width="634" alt="Cherry Seaborn, in the class below Ed Sheeran at Thomas Mills High School, was an ace on the hockey field." class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-70cad3539c033a60" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/00/485A192900000578-5295607-Ed_posted_an_Instagram_announcing_the_engagement_saying_Got_myse-a-3_1516579296950.jpg" height="603" width="634" alt="Ed posted an Instagram announcing the engagement, saying: ‘Got myself a fiancé just before new year. We are very happy and in love, and our cats are chuffed as well’" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">And indeed, on Saturday he revealed to his 19 million followers on Instagram that the pair are engaged. ‘Got myself a fiancé just before new year,’ he said. ‘We are very happy and in love, and our cats are chuffed as well.’ (They have two, Dorito and Calippo). The announcement was accompanied by a touching photograph of 26-year-old Ed with his arms around Cherry, planting a kiss on her cheek.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No details of the wedding have been forthcoming, but it’s possible it will be held in the Framlingham area, where Ed has a property and where both families have roots. Ed’s parents still live in the town, and Cherry’s are about ten miles away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to one showbusiness source, Sheeran is believed to have turned down £3 million from the magazine Us Weekly to cover the nuptials. The couple instead plan on a relatively ‘low key’ event, with not many celebs — although Ed’s close friend, pop star Taylor Swift, is likely to be an exception.</p><video preload="none" id="4384172627645777861" title="Ed Sheeran gets engaged to his girlfriend, Cherry Seaborn" poster="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/19/4869ACA200000578-0-image-a-13_1516561737772.jpg">

He said: ‘I was quite a weird kid when I was little' (pictured: Ed Sheeran as a child)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ed WILL want some formality, though — he once commented that he’d carefully planned out the placing of his 60 tattoos so he could easily hide them on his wedding day. ‘You will never see them in a suit,’ he said. ‘I want to get married and look great.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ed and his fiancée are clearly besotted, although they seem like chalk and cheese. Creative Ed tends to present a rather shambolic appearance to the world, while Cherry, 25, is a well-put-together, athletic young woman with a sharp business mind.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what Ed loves about Cherry is that she is so normal and unstarry — although there are some eccentricities in her family, such as the fact that her middle name is Paean, meaning ‘a song of praise or triumph’, while her brother Charlie is actually Charlemagne.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ed’s song How Would You Feel (Paean), from Divide, appears to be a reference to his fiancée’s moniker. Its romantic lyrics (‘I’ll be taking my time, spending my life / Falling deeper in love with you’) suggest he was thinking about the long term early in their relationship.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an interview in February last year, he said the song had been written some time previously, explaining: ‘I said to my girlfriend, “What’s your favourite song on the album?” She said: “You’ve forgotten it existed and I have it in my email because I’m the only one you sent it to.” So she picked it out from like, a year-and-a-half ago and I ended up recording it.’</p><img id="i-aa85e6d0ec63e5ba" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/23/486A792000000578-5295607-image-m-10_1516578237115.jpg" height="570" width="634" alt="Cherry completed her science degree at Durham University, then travelled to America to take a qualification at the Master of Management Studies programme at Duke University in North Carolina (pictured: Cherry Seaborn as a child)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, who is Cherry Seaborn? She grew up in a charming period property in a village outside Framlingham with her mother Ann, father Matthew, an architect, and younger brother. Charlie is in the same business as his brother-in-law-to-be, writing film and theatre music.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While Cherry was one of those lovely, grounded girls who is friends with everyone, young Ed was a bit of an awkward teenager. ‘I was quite a weird kid when I was little,’ he said. ‘I wore big glasses, had hearing problems, had a stutter and I had ginger hair.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He lived with mum and dad, Imogen and John, and brother Matthew, in Framlingham, but dropped out of school at 16 to seek his fortune as a singer. At the outset he busked and slept rough under an arch near Buckingham Palace.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cherry took a more orthodox route to success. After completing her science degree at Durham University, she travelled to America to take a qualification at the Master of Management Studies programme at Duke University in North Carolina. This allowed her to pursue her passion for hockey as part of the university’s prestigious Blue Devils hockey team.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mark Barreca, whose daughter Hannah played with her, said: ‘Cherry is a wonderful young lady, really nice and a great hockey player. Ed Sheeran is a lucky guy.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hockey was a big part of Cherry’s life at Duke, and she gave some insight into her personality when she spoke to the university magazine. ‘I’m a massive team player,’ she said. ‘I don’t really do it for myself, the thing I like the most is being a part of something that’s bigger than just you and that you can give something that makes other people happy and makes other people succeed.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the summer of 2015, she was still in America when Ed visited the country. Coincidentally, it was around this time he had been in the doldrums about fame and the lack of freedom that came with it.</p><img id="i-710f1dbee4cbfea4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/00/485A1B0C00000578-5295607-_Cherry_is_a_wonderful_young_lady_really_nice_and_a_great_hockey-a-30_1516582796882.jpg" height="935" width="634" alt="'Cherry is a wonderful young lady, really nice and a great hockey player. Ed Sheeran is a lucky guy': Mark Barreca, whose daughter Hannah played hockey with Cherry, praised the 25-year-old" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an interview last year, he said: ‘I stayed inside for four months. I watched movies. I couldn’t just go out and get a pint of milk. I always wanted to maintain normality. I was ordering takeaways and putting on a lot of weight.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was recovering, also, from the breakdown of his relationship in the February that year with Athina Andrelos, who works as a manager for Jamie Oliver’s food company. The couple had been photographed on yachts in various exotic locations, living the sort of life expected of a pop star — but all the sunning and fun didn’t suit Ed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2013, a fling with singer Ellie Goulding, similarly a British pop sensation lauded for her songwriting, had also come to nothing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And so Ed was keen to reconnect with friends from the old days. He and Cherry got in touch, and soon the pair were being spotted out and about at baseball matches and suchlike.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the U.S., he was probably more able to go about his business without being mobbed by fans, giving the relationship time to blossom.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last year Ed said in an interview: ‘This has been the first time I’ve ever actually had the time to fall in love properly. I’ve always got into relationships very passionately — I’m a redhead and also Irish.</p><img id="i-9734cd306f38967" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/00/485A7B0700000578-5295607-Ed_and_his_fianc_e_are_clearly_besotted_although_they_seem_like_-a-29_1516582796546.jpg" height="955" width="634" alt="Ed and his fiancée are clearly besotted, although they seem like chalk and cheese.

  </video><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I’m ready, let’s go — tour bus babies, little fat, chubby babies that just walk around,’ he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2016, the pair went off travelling for five months. They visited Japan, New Zealand and Ghana before heading to Iceland to see the Northern Lights. While there, Ed had a horrifying mishap when he put his foot in a boiling geyser, which melted the skin off his foot. ‘I had to get choppered out. I missed the Northern Lights as I was in hospital,’ he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the pair returned, Cherry took up her position at Deloitte in London. Early last year she joined a hockey club in South London.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cherry’s addition to the team has been quite exciting for anyone who likes both hockey and Ed Sheeran — he has been seen cheering on the sidelines at one or two matches.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The couple are believed to have been living together for about a year — Ed has a property in London, too. They’ve been spotted once or twice browsing around Portobello Road Market, but tend to shun celebrity parties.</p><img id="i-c1d73fdbbff8e66e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/00/485A1B1C00000578-5295607-No_details_of_the_wedding_have_been_forthcoming_but_it_s_possibl-a-31_1516582799864.jpg" height="947" width="634" alt="No details of the wedding have been forthcoming, but it’s possible it will be held in the Framlingham area, where Ed has a property and where both families have roots" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The only time they could have been accused of courting attention is when they arrived at presenter Jonathan Ross’s house for a Halloween party last year in matching pink coats and hats.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cherry’s stabilising influence is undoubtedly good for Ed. He’s accident prone; he once accidentally smashed a bottle of beer into his hand and the stitches split open while he was playing guitar.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Recently, he told of how Cherry had to nurse him after a bike accident last October. She even ‘had to brush my teeth’, he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are other troubles she may have helped him through, too. He has been embroiled in a stressful legal suit with songwriters for the track Amazing sung by X Factor winner Matt Cardle, who claimed he had copied the song ‘note for note’ for his hit song, Photograph. A $20 million lawsuit (£13.8 million) was launched against Sheeran. The case was settled last April; no details were released.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But all this, and solitary nights at home consoling himself with pizza, is behind him. Cherry’s sports regimen has rubbed off a little on Ed. In an interview last year, he revealed he has started doing exercise — ten minutes a day, ‘intervals of 30 seconds sprinting and 30 jogging’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sheeran is currently in the midst of a world tour so when he and Cherry will fit in the wedding is anyone’s guess. His lucky number is 17 and Cherry’s is 19, so perhaps it will be on the 17th or the 19th of an upcoming month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ed has said he would like to send his children to his school, Thomas Mills. He has a tattoo of its emblem above his belly button.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So who would bet against the happy couple ending up settling back in Framlingham, living quietly in the country — and, with the small exception of his vast wealth and fame, enjoying a life almost like the old days?</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Ed Sheeran and Cherry Seaborn (pictured together on the left) developed a close friendship during their time at school in Framlingham, Suffolk, and some said that Ed (pictured as a child inset left) had a crush on her pictured as a child inset right) - although she had a boyfriend. Then life intervened and they went their separate ways. Cherry earned a degree in molecular biology and represented England in the Under-21 hockey team.

I am happy with where I am in life, but I want my children to be happy, and that's why we are in court, because you are not allowing my children the contents of our mother's will,' he added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He told the judge that for many years he 'held Timothy in huge esteem and respect as the younger brother,' but that their relationship had since 'deconstructed' due to the 'huge conflict' between the three over their mother's house and money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Baxter told the judge that Timothy is currently 'in occupation and control of Mrs Heath's house and its contents' and accused him of using his position as executor as a 'bargaining chip' with his brothers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Timothy had been 'wilfully obstructive to the administration of the estate by failing to comply with reasonable requests,' Mr Baxter claimed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He asked the judge to remove Timothy as an executor due to an 'inherent conflict between his duties as an executor and his own personal interests.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The barrister also disputed Timothy's claim that he had been unable to match his brothers' financial success in life because they had left the job of caring for their ailing mother to him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He was 45 years old by the time he began this care', said Mr Baxter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He is over-egging the pudding by saying that the care he has given for the last eight years has prevented him establishing himself in life.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ruling on the case, Mr Justice Carr accepted that Timothy was 'acting as one of three full time carers' for the last eight years of his mother's life, adding: 'Dominic did not give any recognition of the fact that his brother must have given care to their mother.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I accept that 24 hour-a-day care was provided by three carers, each doing eight hour shifts, one of whom was Timothy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I got the impression that Dr Dominic Heath didn't want to acknowledge that Timothy provided any care for their mother, despite living with her in the property for many, many years,' the judge said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I am not satisfied that Timothy has acted in any way improperly...nor do I accept that he has acted deliberately in any attempt to frustrate probate,' the judge went on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But he found that there was an 'irreconcilable conflict between Timothy having a claim on the estate, on one hand, and being an executor on the other.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'His position is that, for several years, he provided care for his mother and his brothers did not.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He claims to be entitled to a greater share of the estate than the 1971 will provides, that he is entitled to recompense and that his services to his mother ought to be recognised.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'That gives rise to a conflict of interest between his duties as an executor and his potential claim against the estate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I think that the claim to remove Timothy as an executor is well founded and I intend to accede to it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The judge ordered Timothy to step down, to be replaced by an independent solicitor, but ordered the two medics to pay their own £25,000 costs of bringing the application to remove their brother as an executor.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also warned the two doctors that they may have to step aside as executors themselves if further conflicts of interest arise.  </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Dominic  (inset centre) and Jeremy Heath (inset right) are fighting their brother Timothy (inset left) over their mother's £1.8million fortune (left, Rachel Heath with a carer), including her house in Hampstead, north London.

  </video><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has been four months since Megyn Kelly earned the wrath and ire of Jane Fonda for asking the 80-year-old actress about her plastic surgery, and the NBC host is now responding to the backlash.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That moment occurred during Kelly's third episode on September 27 when she asked the Oscar-winner about what work she had done in the past, which prompted a steely Fonda to stare Kelly down and ask: 'We really want to talk about that now?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since then Fonda has complained about the question to a number of outlets, and even mocked Kelly's question on Today last week during an interview with Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When she first complained publicly after the program, and repeatedly, I chose to say nothing, as my general philosophy is what other people think of me is none of my business,' said Megyn at the end of her program on Monday. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'However, Fonda was at it again last week, including right here on NBC, and then again elsewhere. So it's time to address the poor-me routine.' </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'First, some context. Fonda was on to promote a film about aging. For years she has spoken openly about her joy in giving a cultural face to older women,' Kelly told her studio audience.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Well the truth is most older women look nothing like Fonda, who is now 80. And if Fonda really wants to have an honest discussion about older women's cultural face, then her plastic surgery is tough to ignore.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She continued: 'Fonda herself knows this. She knows this. And that is why, to her credit, she’s discussed her cosmetic surgery pretty much everywhere before coming on our show.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kelly went on to list the many outlets that Fonda has complained to along with the many outlets to which she has previously discussed her plastic surgery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today was one of them, with Lily Tomlin joking last week during an interview with Kotb and Guthrie about how long she had known Fonda by stating: 'Oh, my God…I think before your first facelift!' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fonda shot back: 'Who are you, Megyn Kelly?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the moment, all four women erupted in laughter, and the exchange was later posted on social media. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Jane Fonda had quite the response to Lily Tomlin's facelift question, read the caption. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kelly does not seem to be laughing however in the wake of that interview. </p><div class="mol-html" id="mol-8a361270-ff9c-11e7-b719-074218538f37">                            <div><div style="position:relative; padding-bottom:63%; padding-bottom:-webkit-calc(56.25% + 50px); padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 50px); height: 0;">    <iframe style="position:absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.today.com/offsite/megyn-kelly-i-have-no-regrets-about-my-question-to-jane-fonda-1142616131655" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe>  </div></div>                        </div><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Look, I gave her the chance to empower other women, young and old, on a subject which she purports to know well and she rejected it. That’s okay. But I have no regrets about the question,' explained Kelly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Nor am I in the market for a lesson from Jane Fonda on what is and is not appropriate. After all, this is a woman whose name is synonymous with outrage.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is when Kelly launched into Fox News mode. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Look at her treatment of our military during the Vietnam war, many of our veterans still call her "Hanoi Jane" thanks to her radio broadcasts which attempted to shame American troops. She posed on an anti-aircraft gun used to shoot down our pilots,' stated Kelly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'She called our POW's "hypocrites and liars" and referred to their torture as understandable. Even she had to apologize years later for that gun picture - but not for the rest of it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She then closed out by saying: 'By the way she still says she's not proud of America. So, the moral indignation is a little much. She put her plastic surgery out there. She said she wanted to discuss the plight of older women in America. And honestly she has no business lecturing anyone on what qualifies as offensive.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kelly's claim is inaccurate however, with Fonda apologizing directly to a group of Vietnam veterans in 2015 while appearing at an event in Maryland.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Whenever possible I try to sit down with vets and talk with them, because I understand and it makes me sad,' Fonda told those assembled at the Weinberg Center for Arts according to <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fredericknewspost.com/z/content_type/news_article/jane-fonda-met-with-protest-in-frederick-hopes-for-open/article_f76347a9-d99c-56d1-85a8-af1bc5432524.html">The Frederick News-Post</a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It hurts me and it will to my grave that I made a huge, huge mistake that made a lot of people think I was against the soldiers.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She later described herself as a 'lightening rod' to many, like to 50 protesters outside the venue that evening who carried signs reading: 'Forgive? Maybe. Forget? Never.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fonda then explained: 'This famous person goes and does something that looks like I’m against the troops, which wasn’t true, but it looked that way, and I’m a convenient target. So I understand.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She would not say however she regretted travelling to North Vietnam. </p><div class="mol-html" id="mol-e1a666e0-ff8d-11e7-a1c5-f19ecb89f0c6">                            <div><blockquote class="twitter-video" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Jane Fonda had quite the response to Lily Tomlin's facelift comment <a href="https://t.co/2qUUxReqiy">pic.twitter.com/2qUUxReqiy</a></p>— TODAY (@TODAYshow) <a href="https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/953262104039055360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2018</a></blockquote></div>                        </div><img id="i-1ce9adc058b570cb" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/15/487614BA00000578-5298341-image-a-10_1516635833639.jpg" height="354" width="634" alt="Oh no she did not: Fonda (above in September after being asked about her plastic surgery) had recently spoken about the question in an interview with Variety and on Today last week" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-87708bef0411551f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/00/4876237800000578-5300261-Going_hard_She_called_our_POW_s_hypocrites_and_liars_and_referre-a-7_1516667289263.jpg" height="354" width="634" alt="Going hard: ''She called our POW's &quot;hypocrites and liars&quot; and referred to their torture as understandable,' Kelly said of Fonda (above in image on set)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-4feab1483a17f1e0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/16/487614C900000578-5298341-image-a-20_1516637188012.jpg" height="356" width="634" alt="Grudge match: Kelly failed to mention that she herself had run multiple segments on her Fox News show The Kelly File which were highly critical on Fonda (pair above in September)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Viewers of The Kelly File might recognize these comments from episodes of the host's Fox News program. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In at least three videos from 2014, Kelly welcomed guests on her program to trash Jane Fonda while also taking some shots of her own at the Oscar winner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In one interview with Dennis Miller in June of that year, Kelly smiled while saying that 'things went south' for the actress after her role in 'Barbarella.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She continued to laugh as Miller said that Fonda 'made sense' to him when she played the the title character in that film, a voluptuous space traveler from the planet Earth who spent most of her time in little to no clothing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those comments were made in response to her actions during the Vietnam War. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'She's not beloved by a large portion of Americans,' said Kelly in that interview. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just a few months before Kelly and Miller went after Fonda in 2014, the host also called out then-first lady Michelle Obama for saying she admired the actress' political savvy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The thing is, if she had just said I want to have a body like Jane Fonda when I'm 76 most women would say, "yeah, me too,'' said Kelly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But when she named the political savvy and said she was someone she wanted to live like she crossed over into territory where people would criticize her.' </p><mol-permabox id="mol-aaae2940-ff95-11e7-a1c5-f19ecb89f0c6"></mol-permabox><video preload="none" id="3998113307001" title="Jane Fonda speaks out against Vietnam War in 1972" poster="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/01/19/video-undefined-24D8307600000578-748_638x362.jpg">

  </video><p class="mol-para-with-font">In what looked at the time to be an ill-advised and poorly conceived move, Kelly decided to ask the actress to detail the plastic surgery she has had done over the year back in September.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You, you've been an example to everyone, on how to age beautifully and with strength. And unapologetically,' began Kelly, nervously drawing out her question.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You admit you had work done. I think it's to your credit. You look amazing. Have you ... why did you say .. I read you felt you're not proud to admit you had work done, why not?' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is when Fonda asked why they were discussing the subject.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kelly tried her best to salvage the question, with Fonda at that point glancing over to her guest Robert Redford in disbelief that she was being asked that question while out promoting the pair's new film, 'Our Souls at Night.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Well, one of the things people think about when they look at you, is how amazing you look,' said Kelly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A composed-as-ever but noticeably chilly Fonda at that point demurred: 'Thanks. Good attitude. Good posture. Take care of myself.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She then took control of the interview from Kelly by telling the host: 'Let me tell you why I love this movie that we did, "Our Souls at Night," rather than plastic surgery.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Redford then looked at his co-star and showed his support for her by laughing and saying: 'Back to that, huh.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fonda then launched into her own talk about the film, no longer waiting or wanting to take one of Kelly's questions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You kind of have a choice in life, when you get to be close to 80, or even before then, what you want to do with your life. And my character, Addie, in this movie, she knows there's a lot more time behind her than in front,' explained Fonda.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And she doesn't want to go down lonely and scared. She's been a widow, living in this house by herself. And she's lonely and scared. And she's a shy person, who is not someone who would normally do this.

As long as I've known Jane, she always has been moving forward. And doesn't look back,' said Redford.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And whatever pain, whatever problem she's had in the past, remains in the past. And she keeps moving forward. It's an admirable quality. And few people have it like Jane does.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rest of the interview was a wash, with Kelly getting no response from Fonda when she launched into a bit about how she was an aerobics instructor for 10 years shortly after the actress released her bestselling exercise tapes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And to close it all out, Fonda drove home just how little she cared for Megyn's questions and how proud she was of her looks and how she has aged when the host asked her guests: 'On behalf of our audience member, Victoria wanted to ask, if you could go back to any age in your life, what would it be? I ask that to both of you.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fonda very curtly replied: 'Right now.

That claim is questionable at best, with Fonda stating multiple times that she regrets ever giving off the impression that she did not support US troops. Fonda did not need to defend herself however, with a host of celebs coming to her aid and quickly going after Kelly.

I've always been motivated by this club, by their red colours, which have always stood out for me and I'm genuinely saying this from the heart when I tell you that this is like a dream come true for me, playing for Manchester United. It makes me feel really happy and I'm so pleased to be here at the 'Theatre of Dreams' as everyone calls it!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How big a part of this is Jose Mourinho? </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He indicated it is important for the club for me to be here. I also believe that the club itself cared about me joining, and I got the impression that they were keen for me to come here and wear the number seven shirt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I think that also gets through to the player. Players sometimes need to feel important and loved by the club. That was one of the things that attracted me to come here, along with the manager, who is a person who won everything in Italy, the same as he did in Spain, and he's a manager who likes to win.</p><div class="mol-embed"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="data-instgrm-captioned" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BeRBuSPFGdu/" data-instgrm-version="8" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"> <div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"> <div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div> <p style=" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BeRBuSPFGdu/" style=" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;" target="_blank">Enjoy the best behind-the-scenes footage from a memorable day for #MUFC...

Tran is said to have been ‘mean-spirited’ and ‘exploitative’ and sent messages on Instagram to the 12-year-old daughter of a Snctm founder which left her upset. According to a profile in Esquire Tran is 34-year-old Vietnamese immigrant and was the very first person to buy a Snctm membership. He described himself as sexually repressed until he attended one of the events and is now so liberated that he wears a black leather mask and rabbit ears when he’s partying. The founder of SNCTM previously claimed its members include Grammy-winning artists and said Gwyneth Paltrow (seen inset) has attended their parties with her Glee producer fiance, Brad Falchuk.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Michelle Curran</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-23T14:15:28.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Bunnyman BANNED from Hollywood’s most elite sex club</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-23T14:15:28.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Instagram,California</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/05/487C02BC00000578-0-image-a-26_1516684226005.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/05/487C02D100000578-0-image-m-31_1516684233340.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5300755/Porn-star-Stormy-Daniels-Instagram-account-suspended.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Porn star Stormy Daniels' Instagram account is suspended just days after she stripped off for the start of her 'Make America Horny Again' tour"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5299129/Prosecutors-seek-21-month-sentence-Pauls-neighbor.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Prosecutors to seek 21-month sentence for Rand Paul's neighbor who tackled him in the front yard and broke six of the senator's ribs after a dispute over the state of his lawn"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/sex/a49689/snctm-sex-club-masquerade/" title="The Last Hour Inside the Masquerade Party at Snctm Sex Club (NSFW)"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.instagram.com/snctm_bunnyman/?hl=en" title="¿¿ (@snctm_bunnyman) ¿ Instagram photos and videos"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://sanctumclub.org/" title="sanctumclub.org/"></link></item><item><title>Girl time!

But a new 3D film by Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson is set to bring the conflict to life in a way never seen before. The Oscar-winner has restored and colourised 100-year-old footage from the Imperial War Museum's vast archive, and early photos suggest the results will be remarkable. One comparison shot shows the dramatic transformation from poor quality black-and-white scenes to clear colour images, while another shows the radically sharpened faces of our troops. Jackson said he hoped the film, which will premiere at the BFI London Film Festival before airing on BBC1 later this year, will help audiences better connect 'with the events on screen'.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Khaleda Rahman</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-23T12:27:59.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Peter Jackson transforms grainy WWI footage to make new film</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-23T12:27:59.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/18/4877B09600000578-0-image-a-3_1516645725656.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/18/48723D7C00000578-0-image-a-21_1516645876136.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5288605/Buckingham-Palace-revamp-uncovers-Victorian-era-clipping.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Frozen in time: Workmen renovating the Queen’s apartments in Buckingham Palace uncover fascinating detritus from Victoria’s reign – including cigarette packs and a 130-year-old newspaper"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5297289/The-British-women-conquered-Sahara.html?ito=rss_msn" title="The British women who conquered the Sahara: Daring duo were the first in the world to cross the desert on motorbikes in 1934 (despite not having a compass) "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5296273/Tokyo-simulates-military-attack-WWII-amid-N-Korea-threat.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Tokyo holds its first military attack evacuation drill since WWII as tensions rise over North Korea's nuclear programme"></link></item><item><title>'I will never forget his gentle spirit': Naomi Watts pays tribute to her ex Heath Ledger as Michelle Williams' BFF Busy Philipps breaks down in tears on 10th anniversary of his death</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5299385/Naomi-Watts-pays-tribute-Heath-Ledger-10-years-later.html?ito=rss_msn</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 20:07:18 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5299385</guid><description><![CDATA[Naomi Watts has paid tribute to late Brokeback Mountain actor Heath Ledger on the 10th anniversary of his death.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Carlos Carvalhal likened his team’s position to being 'in hospital' but they are ready to fight for survival.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Compared to how they looked when the sides last faced each other on Boxing Day – a spiritless, shambolic mess who were thrashed 5-0 – Swansea have made giant strides under Carvalhal. They were organised, defiant and, from the first whistle, not cowed by the challenge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What Carvalhal needed was maximum concentration from his players and the new manager, as he tried to impart his orders, was a persistent, fidgeting presence on the touchline, demanding they stay compact to keep the door closed to Liverpool, who he knew would dominate possession.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I told the players that Liverpool were like a Formula One (car),’ Carvalhal colourfully explained. ‘But a Formula One car at 4pm in traffic on the streets of London does not have great speed. I told my players to put Liverpool in traffic.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stuck in the gridlock of persistent tackling, Liverpool lacked the ingenuity and speed that saw them torpedo Manchester City’s unbeaten run eight days earlier.

He was efficient with his clearances, crisp with his passing and his huge physical presence screamed authority; he missed nothing in the air, either, so it was a shock when another header led to the opening goal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Swansea had struggled to create a clear opportunity but in the 40th minute they took the lead. Van Dijk met Martin Olsson’s corner but his header bounced off Federico Fernandez’s legs and Mawson, who had been left unmarked, swept in a crisp finish.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They have been looking to catch a break like this for some time but what Fernandez could not have expected was his nose being broken in the celebrations: as he hugged Mawson, Mike Van Der Hoorn leapt onto his back, jolting the captain’s face into Mawson. Fernandez needed two stitches. </p><img id="i-d644df4b31b15c8e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/21/4878AFE700000578-0-image-a-100_1516656359322.jpg" height="575" width="962" alt="Sadio Mane fails to control his effort after meeting Roberto Firmino's cross with a volley minutes before half-time" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-50421272a2d54d30" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/21/4878AFE300000578-0-image-a-103_1516656443250.jpg" height="585" width="962" alt="Senegalese forward Mane shows his frustration after passing up an inviting chance to draw his team level" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-5fc3e345fca0d76" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/21/4878C57900000578-5299753-Salah_fires_a_fine_free_kick_towards_the_top_left_corner_before_-a-121_1516657984477.jpg" height="506" width="962" alt="Salah fires a fine free-kick towards the top left corner before it is tipped over the bar by Lukasz Fabianski (right)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-90061c353078c792" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/21/4878B9EE00000578-0-image-a-105_1516656570447.jpg" height="679" width="962" alt="Liverpool's top scorer looks on after watching his free-kick get saved brilliantly by the Swansea goalkeeper " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">His absence from the playing field, as Swansea’s medical staff sprayed and bandaged the wound, could have had costly ramifications but in a quick break in first half injury time, Mane fired wide when charging into the space Fernandez would have been to meet a cross from Salah.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Klopp sent Liverpool out early for the second half and, soon enough, his anxiety about the deficit they had to retrieve could be seen in his actions: pointing, whistling, bickering with the fourth official and assistant referee when things failed to go his side’s way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having failed to keep a Premier League clean sheet since December 9, nullifying the second highest scorers in the country was going to take a huge effort but it was one which Swansea were keen to undertake, the five-man defence giving Liverpool’s attack no space to breathe.</p><img id="i-1a28cf00e17853bd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/21/4878E4AE00000578-5299753-image-a-124_1516658344655.jpg" height="686" width="962" alt="English striker Danny Ings comes close to drawing his side level after making space for himself in the Swansea box" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-8e00eb1de732a17c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/22/4878F35B00000578-5299753-image-a-126_1516658408186.jpg" height="694" width="962" alt="Ings holds his head in his hands after Fabianski's save denied him his first Premier League goal of the season" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-fc53e8266f185285" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/22/4878FD0A00000578-5299753-image-a-129_1516658502158.jpg" height="607" width="962" alt="Roberto Firmino's header bounces back off the post in the closing stages of Monday's Premier League clash" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-5a1efe104a0438c3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/22/4878FBDA00000578-5299753-Adam_Lallana_blazed_over_the_bar_with_the_goal_at_his_mercy_-a-132_1516658665123.jpg" height="587" width="962" alt="Adam Lallana blazed over the bar with the goal at his mercy after Firmino's header had come back off the woodwork" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-8f4f6423fc75f46c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/22/4879003100000578-5299753-image-a-133_1516658697943.jpg" height="617" width="962" alt="Firmino shows his dejection after coming agonisingly close to rescuing his side in injury time at the Liberty Stadium " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">For all that Liverpool passed and probed, they kept being pushed down blind alleys.

</div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>DOMINIC KING AT THE LIBERTY STADIUM: With each passing minute, the noise got louder. On each side of the ground, they chanted and sang and, for the first time this season, showed unity. The Liberty Stadium has not offered Swansea much freedom in this most testing campaign but, when it mattered, the locals came together. The outcome, against the odds, was a performance to give hope that, perhaps, all is not lost. Liverpool arrived in South Wales on the back of an 18-match unbeaten run but they left in a state of shock, flattened by a goal from the unlikely source of Alfie Mawson and their hopes to put distance between themselves and Tottenham and Arsenal punctured.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Spencer Morgan</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-23T00:27:12.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Swansea 1-0 Liverpool: Alfie Mawson gives hosts shock victory</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-23T00:27:12.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Premier League,Swansea City,Liverpool</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/21/4878900900000578-0-image-m-112_1516657549739.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5298293/Swansea-vs-Liverpool-LIVE-Follow-Premier-League-action.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Swansea vs Liverpool, LIVE: Jurgen Klopp's team aim to keep pace with top four rivals when they visit Premier League's bottom side at the Liberty"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5226085/Premier-League-January-transfer-window-2018-deals.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Premier League January transfer window: Club-by-club guide to all the 2018 winter moves"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5298811/Sir-Alex-Ferguson-said-Morrison-better-Rooney.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand reveals Sir Alex Ferguson said Ravel Morrison was better than him, Wayne Rooney and Ryan Giggs as a youngster"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/fixtures.html#s2017-m919131?ito=rss_msn" title="Premier League Fixtures 2017/2018: Football Match Dates | Daily Mail Online"></link></item><item><title>Kate Hudson flashes ring on her wedding finger while out with Danny Fujikawa and son Bingham... amid rumors musician proposed on first anniversary</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5298791/Kate-Hudson-flashes-ring-wedding-finger-a.html?ito=rss_msn</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 18:32:30 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5298791</guid><description><![CDATA[Rumors emerged earlier this month that Danny had proposed to the actress on their first anniversary hike, even hinting that they'd secretly got married.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="moduleFull"></div>

The IT manager's Vauxhall Astra car hurtled across a busy junction and ploughed into Helena Thurm (right; and centre, with her brother Mike) as she was crossing the road following a job interview. The 25-year-old former grammar school pupil was thrown into the air by the force of the impact and suffered multiple injuries, before dying the following day in hospital. In a tragic twist, her parents drove past the scene of the collision and saw Wall talking to police at the roadside - but had no idea their daughter was the victim. Today, the victim's family accused him of using his car like a 'killing machine' and condemned his 'selfish and thoughtless actions to get home quicker through traffic'.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Mark Duell</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-22T18:43:38.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>'Selfish' driver who killed graduate is jailed for 2 years</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-22T18:43:38.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Manchester</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/18/4877A9FF00000578-0-image-a-3_1516646023102.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/14/48744E5D00000578-0-image-a-122_1516632212576.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1175339</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5296989/Audi-driver-smashed-man-19-landed-50-yards-away.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Audi driver smashes into pedestrian, 19, and hurls him 50 yards along the street in horror hit-and-run which has left him in a wheelchair unable to walk "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5290983/Smart-motorway-horror-sees-lorry-crash-familys-car.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Parents relive the horrific moment a lorry smashed in to their broken down VW van at up to 60mph on a stretch of motorway with NO hard shoulder"></link></item><item><title>Manchester City star Kevin De Bruyne is 'excited about the future' as he signs a new contract until 2023</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5299069/Manchester-City-star-Kevin-Bruyne-signs-new-contract.html?ito=rss_msn</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 18:06:30 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5299069</guid><description><![CDATA[Kevin De Bruyne has signed a new five-year contract at Manchester City to commit his future to the club until 2023.

Jane (main right), Arnna (main left), and Grant (main centre) Beaumont disappeared from Glenelg beach in Adelaide on Australia Day 1966, never to be seen again despite a major manhunt and one of the nation's biggest ever police investigations. Police excavated a small part of the factory land in 2013 (top right) after a book was published claiming the children were buried there, but nothing was found. The new search will examine a different part of the land, at the rear of the property. This new information brings deceased Adelaide businessman, Harry Phipps (bottom right), back to the centre of the investigation as a suspect. Mr Phipps allegedly had two men dig a hole the size of a grave at the factory, which he owned at the time. Mr Phipps was the character alluded to in The Satin Man – a book written about the investigation into the missing children.

He is just a down to earth Suffolk boy at heart – so who can blame him for wanting to settle down here? It is a lovely part of the world. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He has bought all the properties next door.

His most striking addition was his tree house complex made up of three interconnected timber huts with conical roofs on a raised platform. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also added the 26ft by 26ft ‘pod’ in his garden which has been described by locals as ‘a Hobbit Hole’. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The singer seemed to make himself home so much that he bought the four bedroom detached house in front of his farmhouse in September 2016. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Land Registry records show that he paid £925,000 for the house when it had only been sold for £330,000 in 2005, suggesting that he may have paid over the odds to secure the sale. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The former owner of the house who is now living in London refused to comment when contacted by MailOnline on Tuesday.

Plans show that his cinema will measure around 35ft by 20ft and his music room will be 25ft by 18ft. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The eight foot high rooms and an adjoining toilet will partly extend under the singer’s existing barn and are accessed by a tunnel entrance from a new orangery extension on his farmhouse. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Plans for the barn show it has a bar area with a mezzanine floor and even a pair of mens’ urinals, a normal WC and two hand basins. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lego House hitmaker Sheeran was granted listed building consent by Suffolk Coastal District Council for the plans last September. Before he got consent, he had to commission an ‘ecological enhancement’ report to ensure that his building plans would not affect bats living in the area. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The specialist report recommended that he plant more native species hedgerows for bats to forage in, build boxes for them to nest in and erect a trellis with plants to encourage more insects as a food source for them. </p><img id="i-ddd89ada02fae93c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/16/485A7B0700000578-5298295-image-m-293_1516636798178.jpg" height="1349" width="962" alt="Love: Ed and Cherry are believed to have first met in school but they have been dating as adults since 2015" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Changes to exterior lighting to avoid dazzling bats was also recommended in the report. Sheeran also won a planning battle last year to build a new cartlodge garage with space for four vehicles and a storeroom upstairs. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Council officials had originally refused him permission for the outbuilding after ruling that it would be 'an incongruous feature' in a 'peaceful rural setting'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They also claimed that the grey slate roofed cartlodge would cause 'considerable harm' and 'present a creeping domestication' to the surrounding area. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Sheeran appealed to the Government’s Planning Inspectorate and got the ruling overturned. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The singer first revealed that he had his own pub at his country home last January in an interview with Zane Lowe for Beats 1 / Apple Music Radio.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When asked about his home, he said: ‘Yeah it’s getting there I’ve built a pub. Like I had a bar before, a bar where you could pour beers but now this has like a selection of beers which is cool. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘So basically there’s an underground tunnel to get there that you can close off. So if I have a party everyone goes in the pub and no one can get in the house so you get no one, raiding the cupboards or smashing anything. You have to go underground to get to the pub.’  </p><video preload="none" id="4765746008766762441" title="Ed Sheeran gushes about Beyonce helping him remix song Perfect" poster="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/01/17/46E27C3800000578-0-image-m-5_1512150475023.jpg">

Senate Democrats accepted a deal to reopen the government on Monday, after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged to take up immigration legislation – including a permanent fix for the controversial DACA program – in the next three weeks. The final 81-18 Senate tally was a far cry from the crashing failure of a similar measure on Friday that saw handfuls of Senators from both parties crossing the aisle but fall well short of the 60 votes needed for passage. When the dust settled, 33 of the 49 Democrats had voted to turn the lights back on. Republican Sen.

Sanchez will earn £350,000 a week at Old Trafford - by far and away the biggest deal ever signed by a Premier League footballer.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Matt Smith</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-23T12:25:49.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Alexis Sanchez tops Premier League wage table with £350k Man Utd deal</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-23T12:25:49.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Liverpool,Manchester City,Manchester United,Premier League,Kevin De Bruyne,Chelsea,Alexis Sanchez</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/12/487EF67200000578-0-image-a-6_1516710344522.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/11/4877DE8700000578-0-image-m-52_1516706242354.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1219887</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Man Utd via Getty Images</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5299069/Manchester-City-star-Kevin-Bruyne-signs-new-contract.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Manchester City star Kevin De Bruyne is 'excited about the future' as he signs a new contract until 2023"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5301717/Man-United-new-boy-Alexis-Sanchez-rocks-Carrington.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Manchester United new boy Alexis Sanchez rocks up at Carrington equipped with mate tea ahead of meeting his new team-mates and first training session for his new club"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5301483/Alexis-Sanchez-receives-welcome-message-Jesse-Lingard.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Manchester United new boy Alexis Sanchez receives welcome message from Jesse Lingard: 'Knew you wanted to come Milly Rock with the mandem' "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5288415/Alexis-Sanchez-latest-star-Arsenal-sold.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Alexis Sanchez joins the likes of Ashley Cole, Kolo Toure and Robin van Persie on list of stars Arsenal have sold to league rivals... but what happened next and who got the better deal?"></link></item><item><title>Alexis Sanchez on brink of sealing Manchester United move as both he and Henrikh Mkhitaryan head to immigration centre for work permit</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5297411/Sanchez-Mkhitaryan-waiting-green-light.html?ito=rss_msn</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 11:41:56 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5297411</guid><description><![CDATA[Alexis Sanchez is on the brink of completing his mega-money move to Manchester United as he and Henrikh Mkhitaryan push through their work permits.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

And on Friday a trailer surfaced on YouTube that made it seem like that might finally be happening 14 years later. Fans reacted enthusiastically to the news on social media over the weekend - with many questioning if it was real but expressing their excitement regardless.  But unfortunately, the trailer is a hoax.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Abigail Miller</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-22T14:41:16.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Fans go crazy over a viral 'trailer for a new Friends movie'</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-22T14:41:16.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Jennifer Aniston,YouTube</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/01/486D3E5600000578-0-image-a-49_1516583155469.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/01/486CED9300000578-0-image-a-64_1516583678080.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5295459/24th-Annual-SAG-Awards-red-carpet-piece.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Sparkle is the new black!

They want action. They want to buy their way out of trouble, or buy their way into contention. They want to plug gaps or cut out dead wood — and if the frenzy is approaching a peak now, imagine how bad it will be in 12 months when clubs have had even less time to achieve balance in August?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what is the new plan? Incredibly a one-week January window in which to get business completed — as if Premier League owners would behave, if only they had less time to go daft. It is suggested a shorter winter trading period will be up for discussion at the Premier League annual meeting in June — with all the same problems that might yet be an issue this summer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Europe's windows will not close so clubs could be forced to sell, but would no longer be able to buy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Barcelona could have delayed on Philippe Coutinho and tried to undermine a potential Champions League opponent, Liverpool, by taking him late.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And considering Leicester had all summer to get Adrien Silva over the line and failed, why would less time be conducive to more clear-headed negotiation?</p><img id="i-ea42a956b4bcb85" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/19/4877C22900000578-0-image-a-4_1516648702430.jpg" height="443" width="634" alt="Henrikh Mkhitaryan's agent Mino Raiola could cause more havoc against a less forgiving clock" class="blkBorder img-share" /><video preload="none" id="7510316659196344364" title="Henrikh Mkhitaryan: I've always dreamt of playing for Arsenal" poster="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/01/22/20/2018/01/22/20/video-2132490-865_636x358.jpg">

  </video><p class="mol-para-with-font">Imagine the havoc the agent Mino Raiola could have wreaked inserting his client Henrikh Mkhitaryan into the Alexis Sanchez deal, had it been taking place against a less forgiving clock?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There have been 14 deals on Merseyside alone this January, plus seven by Arsenal. And this needs less time to be conducted sensibly?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">David Moyes, the West Ham manager, even said all business could be tied up in one day if the clubs gathered in a giant meeting room. Yet that would be true, even with the current set-up. The deals could be done in a day, if there was the will. There could be a moratorium on buying on the night of January 1 if the clubs agreed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Could they be trusted? Of course not. Clubs are meant to act in good faith over poaching managers during the season, but that did not stop Everton making multiple attempts to prise Marco Silva from Watford. Why would it be any different with players?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">West Brom manager Alan Pardew did not dismiss the idea of selling Evans this January, but wished for the deal to be completed early so he would have time to line up replacements. And yet, with little more than a week to go, he remains in the dark about the future.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If football clubs really hated mid-season turmoil they could outlaw transfers altogether with a sincere handshake.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The game doesn't actually need more rules, just greater self-control.

If Russia fills all its quota places it will have 213 athletes in Pyeongchang — as opposed to 214 at the Sochi games it corrupted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As expected, Bach's supposed tough line is a rapidly unravelling sham. </p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Jimmy offered us a lesson in humility </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jimmy Armfield was a fine player, a fine manager, a fine broadcaster and a fine man.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was also a beacon of clarity in a modern world of egos and fools.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Charged by the Football Association with finding the successor to Graham Taylor, he did the rounds of senior managers and coaches and returned with one name: Terry Venables.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It wasn't the name the FA wanted to hear; it wasn't a name that was ever particularly popular at Lancaster Gate. Yet it was the right name and England developed hugely under Venables' stewardship. That his tenure lasted just five competitive matches was because others could not put their misgivings and petty vendettas aside.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Armfield was always bigger than that. How many times over the last decade has the game cried out for a man with his sincere and understated rationality?</p><img id="i-91fa66afba0f23e7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/19/48723B7B00000578-0-image-a-9_1516649085750.jpg" height="556" width="634" alt="Blackpool legend Jimmy Armfield passed away after a long battle with cancer on Monday" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">And how equally sad is it that relations between Blackpool's fans and its owners, the Oyston family, have deteriorated to such an extent that even a human gesture is treated with suspicion?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Blackpool have announced that all ticket sales from their game with Charlton on Saturday will be donated to Trinity Hospice, where Armfield was nursed in his final days.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is not enough for some fans to break their continuing boycott of the club — while others do not trust the owners to be true to their word, particularly as there has been talk of an administration fee.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whether to attend is a genuine dilemma for some fans but while there is no right or wrong action, the one thing Armfield was not is cynical. Attendance is not an endorsement of the current regime, but a tribute to a great Blackpool man.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's a free pass, really. Fill his stand, sing his name. His family would appreciate that, at least. </p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">You reap what you sow </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Southampton last won a league game in November. Despite this, it is said that the manager Mauricio Pellegrino is not under immediate pressure. The club is supportive of the situation he inherited from Claude Puel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This would be the situation in which they finished eighth in the league, having reached a major domestic final. So not a bad situation at all, really. More urgent was the situation he inherited from the owners: the one in which the best players are relentlessly sold, leading to a decline in the standard of the football.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Puel also copped the blame for that, mind you. Southampton were not as exciting as they had been in previous years, it was said. Maybe they would have been more exciting with some of the players available to his predecessors:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Graziano Pelle, Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Nathaniel Clyne, Victor Wanyama, Sadio Mane.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Southampton have sold excitement to the highest bidder for years. And it is catching up with them, as invariably happens. A tipping point may have been reached. Few clubs can act as Southampton have without consequence, so this is a crisis entirely of the club's making. Pellegrino just happens to be there at the time. </p><img id="i-2940d3a960c0c2dc" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/19/486B633A00000578-0-image-a-8_1516648925389.jpg" height="407" width="634" alt="Mauricio Pellegrino is not said to be under pressure at Southampton despite a bad run" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Toon bid's sum mess</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">What makes no sense about Amanda Staveley's proposed takeover of Newcastle is the numbers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not just the fact that PCP Capital Partners, her United Kingdom registered company, has no registered assets or employees, nor that it had no income in the year to March 31, 2017 and debts of £3.6million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is the figures around the deal that confuse. Mike Ashley, Newcastle's owner, is believed to want £350m. Staveley says she offered £250m, without conditions, and will spend a further £200m on transfers and improved facilities. That is an investment of £450m. So why not meet Ashley's asking price, with £100m left for transfers and facilities, and a new television contract on the way? A cash injection of £100m, even £50m, would surely keep Newcastle safe. It makes no sense that Staveley (left) is £100m short of the asking price, while claiming to have £100m excess.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Is there scepticism around her bid because she is a woman, her camp asked at the weekend. No. A woman with £350m would be the owner of Newcastle right now, and good luck to her. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The issue is that Staveley insists she is a woman with £350m — more, in fact — but hasn't made an unconditional offer near that sum. Hence questions. </p><img id="i-679965ab8e11b88e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/19/484DDED300000578-0-image-a-10_1516649239518.jpg" height="432" width="634" alt="Amanda Staveley's takeover of Newcastle seems unlikely to go through after recent comments" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was not so much a statement, more a legal notice. 'The catalyst for this decision is that unwarranted approach, something which the board believes has seen a significant deterioration in both focus and results to the point where the long-term future of Watford has been jeopardised,' read Watford's announcement on the dismissal of Marco Silva.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Reading between the lines, that sounds as much like a precursor for legal action against Everton, if Watford go down, as any explanation of the process. It always comes down to money with the Pozzo regime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Winning that battle, however, may be tougher than merely putting out a press release. Have Watford deteriorated since the club rebuffed Everton's approach for Silva? Undoubtedly, yes. Are the two events related? That is harder to say. For a start, Everton's behaviour was hardly outrageous in the circumstances. Unhelpful, yes, but not illegal — unless it can be proved they were directly contacting Silva.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They came in three times, offering more money each time. And while not taking no for an answer is against the spirit of agreements between Premier League stakeholders, it is hardly unheard of in business. Everton probably thought Watford had a price — as Barcelona did of Liverpool over Philippe Coutinho, as Liverpool thought of Southampton over Virgil van Dijk. They were right, Everton were wrong. As long as they conducted negotiations fairly, however, trying to get Silva was no great crime. </p><img id="i-d74303eb57552d89" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/19/4865C52A00000578-0-image-a-6_1516648812825.jpg" height="410" width="634" alt="Watford are aggrieved with Everton over Marco Silva — but they may not have a case" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Equally, there may be more complex reasons for Watford's decline. Silva may be an impact manager, one who makes a quick impression but can't sustain early impetus. He started well at Hull last season, before losing five of his final seven matches, as the club went down. Hull conceded 19 goals in that period — including seven against Tottenham.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Silva did a season at both Olympiacos and Sporting Lisbon. The only club at which he has maintained success is Estoril. His influence could have faded anyway. Watford also started brightly under Walter Mazzarri in 2016-17. Silva and Mazzarri won seven Premier League games by the first week in January, but then struggled. A business model built to make the manager disposable, and with economics at its heart, can lose momentum once safety is achieved.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Everyone at the club starts marking time. Certainly, there was no outside influence on Mazzarri and Watford faded just the same. It happened in 2015-16, too — just two league wins after February 13. Watford may feel aggrieved with Everton over Silva — but that does not mean they have a case.  </p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">His detractors often say that Arsene Wenger does not listen to anybody these days; but it would seem he has even stopped listening to himself. He says he cannot understand why a player would want to leave Arsenal. A logical retort would echo one of his most famous quotes. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Everyone thinks he has the prettiest wife at home.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alexis Sanchez last played 90 minutes on January 3, for Arsenal against Chelsea. He played against Chelsea again, in the EFL Cup, for 24 minutes on January 10. His first Premier League game for Manchester United could be at Tottenham on January 31.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So a full four weeks since his last start. It would appear Jose Mourinho has a dilemma. Sanchez is a fit man, but Tottenham at Wembley are a singular proposition. A fast, energetic team on the biggest pitch in the country. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is probably one of the most exhausting challenges a player will face this season — and certainly not one to enter into unless match fit. Mourinho's decision is whether to play Sanchez in the fixture United face between now and then — away at Yeovil in the FA Cup fourth round on Friday. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Upside, he gets a run-out that shouldn't be too challenging, can be withdrawn once United have the lead — it took them until the 64th minute to score in a 2-0 win down there in 2015 — and he would receive decent fitness preparation for the match against Tottenham. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The downside? It could be a ropey pitch, with League Two defenders putting it about, and what if United's signing of the season turned his ankle in a tie that could have been won with the reserves? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is before the commercial department ask why United unveiled a global star at Huish Park, not Wembley. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Still — that's why Mourinho gets the big bucks. Even more, maybe, than Sanchez.</p><img id="i-2f76dcaec1442360" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/20/4877E14D00000578-0-Sanchez_spoke_at_how_he_is_determined_to_win_every_trophy_during-a-11_1516653507103.jpg" height="448" width="634" alt="Sanchez could make his Manchester United debut at Yeovil Town's Huish Park" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>

Alexis Sanchez has completed his megabucks move to Manchester United in the latest example of Arsenal selling an influential player to a direct rival in the Premier League. It's been a trend that has continued for over a decade since Ashley Cole moved across London's football fault line to Chelsea. Sometimes, the buyer has got the better deal with their signing going on to achieve great things. On other occasions, Arsenal have been justified in their decision to sell. We take a look back at some of the other key players who have been sold by the Gunners and what happened next.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Adam Shergold</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-23T10:30:21.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Alexis Sanchez becomes latest star Arsenal have sold</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-23T10:30:21.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Arsenal,Arsene Wenger,Alexis Sanchez,Premier League</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/08/48519E5200000578-0-image-a-4_1516697816951.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/19/12/483E714C00000578-0-image-m-97_1516366569366.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5299399/Alexis-Sanchez-close-United-Sir-Alex-Ferguson.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Manchester United new boy Alexis Sanchez on how he nearly joined under Sir Alex Ferguson, wearing the iconic No 7 shirt and how dogs Atom and Humber are his best friends "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5301207/Alexis-Sanchez-wore-Man-United-tracksuit-years-move.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Throwback image of Alexis Sanchez wearing a Manchester United tracksuit jacket emerges after star seals transfer"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5299185/Alexis-Sanchez-blasts-Arsenal-legends-criticised-him.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Alexis Sanchez issues 204-word statement blasting Arsenal legends who criticised him and 'cause damage' as he thanks fans, staff and team-mates after Manchester United move"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5296779/Manchester-United-announce-Alexis-Sanchez-signing.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Manchester United announce Alexis Sanchez signing from Arsenal as Henrikh Mkhitaryan heads the other way in swap deal"></link></item><item><title>Cristiano Ronaldo checks bloody head injury with Real Madrid physio's smartphone while he's still on the pitch</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5294869/Cristiano-Ronaldo-checks-face-injury-smartphone.html?ito=rss_msn</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2018 17:47:13 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5294869</guid><description><![CDATA[Cristiano Ronaldo reinforced his claim as the vainest footballer in the world after he appeared to take a Real Madrid physio's smartphone in order to check damage to his face.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Roma recognise that despite the goals Dzeko has scored, the offer from Chelsea is too good to refuse for a player who is 32 in March and one of the club's highest earners.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Matt Smith</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-22T14:41:23.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Chelsea close to £52m double deal for Edin Dzeko and Emerson Palmieri</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-22T14:41:23.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Serie A,Transfer News,Premier League,Chelsea</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/12/48733C1B00000578-0-image-a-90_1516623406001.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/12/486B504200000578-0-image-m-103_1516623445855.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5297283/Chelsea-linked-Carroll-Crouch-why.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Chelsea have been linked with Andy Carroll, Peter Crouch and Ashley Barnes... so why does Antonio Conte want a bruising English striker?"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5295445/George-Weah-president-Liberia.html?ito=rss_msn" title="George Weah was world footballer of the year, Arsene Wenger is his mentor and he played for Chelsea... but now he will become president of Liberia!"></link></item><item><title>'Have I ruined myself?'

After all, he went into politics with just one aim and succeeded spectacularly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Up to a point.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The magnificent Leave victory in 2016 was a vindication of Farage’s virtually single-handed campaign to get Britain out of the EU.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, others can also take credit. But Farage was the figurehead, often a lone voice in the wilderness. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No one had to endure the vilification and violence directed at Farage as he took his message around the country year after year, well before Call Me Dave finally buckled and gave the people a long-overdue referendum.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fifteen years ago, when I was presenting a nightly show on Sky News, I was about the only broadcaster who would give him a regular platform. The mainstream media treated him as a pariah — at best a circus act, at worst a neo-Nazi. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was around the time that New Labour was almost unanimously agreed to have established a 1,000-year reich and opposition to our glorious future as a European statelet was considered futile.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aside from a few principled players in the Conservative Party — former leader and one-time Maastricht rebel Iain Duncan Smith prominent among them — the political establishment wholeheartedly embraced the EU project. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Farage kept banging away, making mischief in Brussels, where he’d managed to get himself elected as an MEP and used his position to ridicule the pompous panjandrums running the show.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Who can forget his wonderful denunciation of the ridiculous Herman Van Rompuy, self-styled former European ‘president’?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘You have the charisma of a damp rag, and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk . . . Who are you? I’d never heard of you. Nobody in Europe had ever heard of you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I would like to ask you, President, who voted for you . . . oh, I know democracy’s not popular with you lot, and what mechanism do the people of Europe have to remove you?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Is this European democracy? You appear to have a loathing for the very concept of the existence of nation states — perhaps that’s because you come from Belgium, which of course is pretty much a non-country . . .</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Sir, you have no legitimacy in this job at all, and I can say with confidence that I speak on behalf of the majority of British people in saying: We don’t know you, we don’t want you, and the sooner you’re put out to grass, the better.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Westminster bubble was horrified. How dare this upstart show such a lack of respect to our European masters? But out in the suburbs and the shires, and on the rundown council estates in the North of England, millions of decent British citizens gave a silent cheer.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Call Me Dave dismissed Farage’s Ukip as a collection of ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’. It was a cruel caricature, but partly accurate. Ukip’s annual conference certainly resembles a roomful of Hyacinth Buckets and men who model themselves on the Major in Fawlty Towers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Ukip was on a roll — and by now Farage was a ubiquitous presence in radio and TV studios, even if he was often only there as an Aunt Sally, to be shouted at by self-righteous presenters and panellists alike.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet Farage stood up to the verbal slings and arrows, and to the nasty physical abuse he frequently had to endure. Cigarette in one hand, pint of best in the other, he kept on plugging away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the 2015 General Election, Ukip polled almost four million votes, a large chunk of them in former Labour strongholds in the North, which felt ignored and abandoned and had suffered the greatest impact from mass immigration.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Farage’s ‘fruitcakes’ didn’t make a parliamentary breakthrough but they delivered the Tories their first Commons majority since 1992, simply by denying Labour seats they had taken for granted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, Cameron feared, they were coming for the Tories, so he panicked and promised a referendum on EU membership. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Say what you like about Call Me Dave, but this was his greatest gift to the people of Britain, an opportunity we seized, asserting our sovereignty and overturning the decades-old project of submerging our country into an anti-democratic United States of Europe.</p><img id="i-b608f19f00f8692" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/01/4839BD1600000578-0-image-a-28_1516672289526.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="To paraphrase Monty Python¿s parrot sketch, Ukip is an ex-party, it has ceased to be" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cameron’s gamble backfired. He resigned immediately and is now reduced to scraping a living on the international lecture circuit, essentially a political end-of-the-pier show.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Next week, he’s playing a small town theatre in Florida, but has sold fewer seats than its current production, Million Dollar Quartet, a jukebox musical featuring hits by Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the States, where they value national independence, Farage is a folk hero, a bigger draw than our former Prime Minister.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And yet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">OK, so the referendum wouldn’t have been won without Boris, Gove and the brave career politicians who dared to defy the Establishment stitch-up. But without Farage, there would have been no referendum, nor would there have been any Brexit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What kind of Brexit, if any, remains to be seen. Which, presumably, is why Farage is now muttering about making a comeback as part of a Ukip Mark II.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The corpse of the old Ukip is still twitching, but without Farage it’s nothing. The party’s on its third post-Farage leader, no one you’ve ever heard of, and he’s on the way out over a few incendiary tweets sent by some dopey bird half his age he’s got himself hooked up with. I can’t be bothered to go into details, because it’s a waste of time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To paraphrase Monty Python’s parrot sketch, Ukip is an ex-party, it has ceased to be.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the reasons Ukip imploded was because those four million voters returned to the two main parties, both of which made manifesto promises to implement Brexit in full, yet now seem hell-bent on either reneging or watering it down so far it becomes meaningless.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So I understand and share Farage’s concern. As I’ve said all along, the fix has been in since the result of the referendum was announced. The political class have stolen our biggest vote in history for anything and made it all about them — not the people they are paid to serve.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Frankly, I don’t trust any of them to deliver the Brexit we voted for. If the vast majority of MPs had their way, they’d stop the whole process in its tracks today. When Theresa May succeeded Call Me Dave, she should have established a grand cross-party coalition to negotiate our departure, including heroic Labour figures such as Gisela Stuart and Kate Hoey.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the central player should have been Farage, a man who knows his way around Brussels and scares the EU to death.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He’d never have put up with the contemptuous treatment being meted out to Britain by Michel Barnier and his ‘damp-rag, low-grade bank clerk’ bureaucrats.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, we’re stuck with Mother Theresa, who spent the referendum hiding behind the sofa and still won’t say whether she’d vote Leave if it was held today.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her new de facto deputy, David Lidington, is a full-on federast, already speculating we could rejoin the EU at some stage. Rejoin? We haven’t even left yet — and never will, other than in name only, if the political establishment prevails.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even David Davis seems to have gone native and Boris has been banished to the outer darkness, certainly when it comes to Brexit. In what kind of Fred Karno government is the Foreign Secretary excluded from the biggest foreign policy issue facing the country in modern history?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Never mind Boris, though. Mrs May should be making plans for Nigel, bringing him into the fold, allowing him to be an integral part of the very Brexit process for which he has campaigned so long, so hard and so selflessly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He doesn’t need a knighthood, or a sinecure in the Lords — each of which would have been a traditional reward for his service to this country. Given the fuss over Mrs Thatcher’s memorial, I suppose a statue in Parliament Square is out of the question, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what is beyond doubt is that, after Thatcher, Farage is the most influential, most significant British political figure since Churchill — much more so than the Westminster pygmies and time-servers who treat him with unwarranted disdain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ukip, the party he led, may be sleeping with the fishes, but if there is any justice, Farage’s career deserves to end in triumph.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let’s hope Enoch was wrong.</p><video preload="none" id="2700890692679544982" title="'She has danced to your tune': Farage on May's Brexit deal" poster="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/13/10/474921F000000578-0-image-m-20_1513161647256.jpg">

He can cut in onto his favoured right foot and get goals but he's not burdened with the main responsibility for scoring and can also get involved in build-up play.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His first interview as a Manchester United player was instructive. 'I really like to play down the left, through the middle, but to tell you the truth, as long as I'm playing football, I'll fit in anywhere.' The left was his first answer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His workrate also means whichever right back or wing back United are facing will find it very hard to have an attacking impact which is important in the modern game. Having Sanchez on the left will have pluses and minuses for Mourinho. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The United manager doesn't like playing Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial together — he believes they are too similar — so having Sanchez on the left will give him licence to play Rashford, one of the great young talents in English football whose game time at United has been restricted this season.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But leaving out Martial won't be easy. The 22-year-old Frenchman has been in fine form this season though his ability to press is not on a par with Sanchez. Martial scored United's winner at Burnley on Saturday, his 11th goal of the season and third in four games.</p><img id="i-c0fae520c3e11286" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/11/485D3C7A00000578-0-image-a-4_1516705361878.jpg" height="415" width="634" alt="Jose Mourinho is unlikely to leave Anthony Martial out after his recent fine performances" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>

In the centre, Sanchez would be continually involved and get on the ball as much as possible, something that is tempting to Mourinho given the financial outlay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Playing Sanchez centrally would also disrupt United as little as possible. They've lost only three league matches this season and the two wide players Jesse Lingard and Martial have worked well in tandem. Juan Mata would be the player to miss out if Sanchez played behind Lukaku.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Spaniard is a very popular figure at the club but on the pitch has never quite justified the £38m he cost from Chelsea, whilst performing very well in some matches. Mata has scored 39 goals in 171 appearances for United. Sanchez's strike rate is likely to be significantly higher.</p><img id="i-f3e0a2e937cafd69" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/11/485B232100000578-0-image-a-5_1516705808513.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="Manchester United playmaker Juan Mata could be the man to miss out after Sanchez's arrival" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS sport" data-version="2" id="mol-26208080-002e-11e8-9931-27266331fa5c">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">SANCHEZ AS STRIKER </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Lingard – Matic, Pogba – Martial</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">               Lukaku, <strong>Sanchez</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sacrificed: </strong> Mata, Rashford</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>OPTION THREE: TWIN STRIKERS</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite lying second in the Premier League table, Mourinho has still faced criticism for negative football this season. Even if it's justified to park the bus at Liverpool, United fans expect more adventure against lesser sides.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">United have impressively kept five clean sheets in a row but have scored only eight goals in that time against Southampton, Stoke, Everton, Derby and Burnley. Not terrible but not great set alongside what Pep Guardiola is doing at Manchester City.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Therefore pairing Sanchez with Lukaku as twin strikers will have its attraction in certain games where United can expect to control the game. Paul Pogba and Nemanja Matic will be tasked with dominating midfield and Sanchez and Lukaku can prioritise finishing off chances.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It'll be interesting to see how Lukaku would respond to having a front partner. The £75m striker has been criticised this season despite scoring a respectable 17 goals. It's been tough for him though when isolated from his team-mates.</p><img id="i-dd1e9e5b8ceb9e6f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/11/487E6CCE00000578-0-image-a-6_1516706125817.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Marcus Rashford has played in every Premier League game under Mourinho this season" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS sport" data-version="2" id="mol-f8b7a280-002e-11e8-9931-27266331fa5c">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">SANCHEZ AS NO 9 </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Lingard – Pogba, Mata – Martial</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">                    <strong>Sanchez</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sacrificed:</strong> Lukaku</p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>OPTION FOUR: LONE STRIKER</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lukaku has already played 36 times this season for club and country. 'The boy is tired. He is physically a monster but he is not a machine,'  Mourinho has complained, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic sidelined nearly all of this season with a knee injury.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no doubt Sanchez can play as a centre forward, or a false nine, in the way Roberto Firmino does for Liverpool. At Arsenal, Arsene Wenger often preferred him to specialist strikers like Olivier Giroud and Sanchez scored 30 goals last season – only Harry Kane and Lukaku got more than his 24 in the Premier League.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I like him to play through the middle because he makes good runs,' said Wenger. 'And he's a good finisher.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Lukaku needs a rest, Sanchez would be a natural replacement. But what is also interesting is whether Sanchez's superior technique and workrate compared to Lukaku means he will get the nod as a lone front man in certain big matches, in the Champions League or the Manchester derby at the Etihad in April for example.</p><img id="i-3c468058dfa7735e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/11/485BE53900000578-0-image-a-8_1516706532791.jpg" height="407" width="634" alt="Romelu Lukaku has led the line for Manchester United this season but needs a rest" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS sport" data-version="2" id="mol-cb304000-002f-11e8-9931-27266331fa5c">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">SANCHEZ ON RIGHT</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sanchez</strong> – Pogba, Mata – Martial</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">                      Lukaku</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sacrificed:</strong>  Lingard</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>OPTION FIVE: BACK ON THE RIGHT</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sanchez is right-footed and when he first came to Europe as a 17-year-old flyer for Udinese, it was as a right winger. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ironically, United's first reported interest in the player came back in 2010 when he'd already done well in Serie A and Sir Alex Ferguson thought he might be a replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo, who had played off that flank for United.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Chilean's career has gone another way and he prefers to cut inside from the left rather than hug the touchline but it will be another option for Mourinho. The big advantage of playing Sanchez on the right is it means he can accommodate Martial who has become an important part of United's current eight-match unbeaten run in the Premier League.</p><img id="i-63248da351894694" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/11/485D51F500000578-0-image-a-13_1516707044025.jpg" height="409" width="634" alt="Jesse Lingard shakes hands with Mourinho after being substituted against Burnley" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>

Tens of thousands of displaced passengers flocked to other stations, with huge crowds building at the likes of Liverpool Street (top right), London Bridge (bottom right) and King's Cross (top left). King's Cross was shut due to overcrowding, with commuters evacuated from the Underground as an alarm went off telling them to get out due to an emergency.

Right after the game ended, Ertz was informed that her husband, Philadelphia Eagles tight end Zach Ertz (right), was going to the Super Bowl. Cameras were rolling as Mrs Ertz started crying tears of joy, then began jumping up and down and hugging her teammates over her husband's victory. Mr Ertz teared up himself as he was shown the video in the locker room. Mrs Ertz plans to fly to Philadelphia to celebrate with her husband, and will cheer him on in two weeks when the Eagles take on the New England Patriots. The couple (center inset) met six years ago at a Stanford University baseball game, and were married last March.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ashley Collman</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-22T20:17:41.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Moment American soccer star found out husband is going to Super Bowl</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-22T20:17:41.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>SuperBowl</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/18/4877A1E300000578-0-image-a-123_1516644126036.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/17/48764AA800000578-0-image-m-119_1516643401838.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content></item><item><title>They're fur real!

News of her suspended account comes just two days after she stripped off for the start of her 'Make America Horny Again' tour in South Carolina Saturday night. Video footage shows the busty blonde porn star, who goes by the name Stephanie Clifford off camera, strutting her stuff on the stage at The Trophy Club in Greenville on the anniversary of President Donald Trump's inauguration. Daniels was using her Instagram to get the word out about her upcoming gigs. It's unclear why her account was blocked but her representative told TMZ that there was no evidence of profanity or nudity. The rep claims that the account was actually laced with inspirational quotes and professional photos, fully clothed.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Valerie Edwards</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-23T13:56:38.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Porn star Stormy Daniels' Instagram account is suspended</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-23T13:56:38.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Instagram</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/04/487B795700000578-0-image-a-32_1516682597022.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/22/486B0FAD00000578-0-image-m-38_1516572970009.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5295409/Stormy-Daniels-puts-South-Carolina-strip-club.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Making America horny again!

It was the first time he has played upon it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Edmund tore into the Bulgarian with his forehand right from the off and immediately broke before holding comfortably. He was in the ascendancy until, going for the lines, he struck two forehands wide to be broken back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Normal service was resumed when he clobbered a forehand return winner on a second break point at 4-4. Serving it out was not easy, with Dimitrov reducing him to 15-40, before he saved himself with two service winners. Another was needed on a break point before he edged ahead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dimitrov settled down more in the second, looking at his box less anxiously than before. The break points were flowing regularly for the Bulgarian after that tight closer in the first, and he had a point to go 4-0 up in the second as he started to get more of a 'read' on the Edmund serve.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The world No 3 was not having it his own way on his serve, either, and – with the general level of play lower than the first – he missed a break point to get back on level terms in the seventh game. This despite a smattering of double faults being gifted to him.</p><img id="i-aee1bc37dddaf3ac" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/06/487CEEF500000578-5301017-image-a-26_1516690625976.jpg" height="417" width="634" alt="The world No 3 was not having it his way on his serve, missing break point to get back on terms" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-4a6b85b0ac51255" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/06/487CDEEC00000578-5301017-image-a-28_1516690766753.jpg" height="434" width="634" alt="Striking seven first serves in out of ten in the third, Edmund was rock solid and put pressure on " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Neither player was managing to lift it when opportunities presented themselves, and there was a break point either way early in the third.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Striking seven first serves in out of ten, Edmund was rock solid on his serve and that put pressure on Dimitrov, who cracked at 3-4, succumbing to his opponent's heavy forehand drives and then helpfully sticking a seventh double fault in the net. Edmund was enjoying his sliced backhand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Edmund was 15-30 down when trying to serve it out, but stepped it up when needed with his in-out forehand into the advantage court doing the job of putting him within a set of the semi-finals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The tide turned in Edmund's favour when the favourite played a poor service game at 2-2 and gave the break away with a wild forehand that went wide.</p><img id="i-649669cdc87bc194" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/07/487CAF3100000578-5301017-image-a-29_1516690835600.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The tide turned in Edmund's favour in the fourth with a poor service game from Dimitrov at 2-2" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dimitrov was wobbling badly but came out with more resolve and broke back immediately. In boxing terms he remained on the ropes and Edmund had another break point in the next game, but could only put a first serve return into the net.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At 4-4 it continued to be scrappy but there was no shortage of tension. Hawk-Eye ruled out a Dimtrov backhand by millimetres to give Edmund two break points and on the second he just made a return and the Bulgarian dumped the ball in the net.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Edmund went 0-30 behind in the last game but kept it together as he was presented with two unforced errors from the world No 3, who will feel this a chance blown.

It ruled that the Bulgarian's last backhand had gone long by a few millimetres, and Edmund had completed a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over the winner of November's ATP Finals in London. He had done by scrapping away and taking advantage of a sometimes wayward performance from the world No 3. For the neutral it was no classic, but it was a tremendous, gutsy effort of will from Edmund, who becomes the first British man since Tim Henman in 2004 not called Murray to make a Major semi-final.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Glen Williams</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-23T12:09:13.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Kyle Edmund beats Grigor Dimitrov to reach Australian Open semi-finals</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-23T12:09:13.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Australia Open</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/10/487DF8FC00000578-0-image-a-25_1516704124337.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/06/487CED9800000578-0-image-m-16_1516690448305.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1104735</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>AP</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-5300007/Kyle-Edmund-v-Grigor-Dimitrov-Australian-Open-2018-LIVE.html?ito=rss_msn" title="AS IT HAPPENED: Relive the action as Edmund downed Dimitrov in brilliant style to reach last four"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-5297335/Novak-Djokovic-Australian-Open.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Novak Djokovic OUT of the Australian Open as world No 58 Hyeon Chung records straight-sets victory to book quarter-final tie with Tennys Sandgren"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-5297209/World-No-97-Tennys-Sandgren-knocks-Thiem-Australia.html?ito=rss_msn" title="World No 97 Tennys Sandgren knocks Dominic Thiem out of Australian Open (and before last week he'd never won a Grand Slam match!): 'I don't know if this is a dream... but all you guys are here and I'm not in my underwear'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-5296329/Angelique-Kerber-battles-beat-Hsieh-Su-Wei.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Former champion Angelique Kerber battles back from a set down to beat Hsieh Su-Wei and reach Australian Open last eight"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-5300007/Kyle-Edmund-v-Grigor-Dimitrov-Australian-Open-2018-LIVE.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Kyle Edmund v Grigor Dimitrov, Australian Open 2018 quarter-final RESULT: British No 2 makes history as he reaches last four for the first time"></link></item><item><title>Borussia Dortmund continue talks with Arsenal over Olivier Giroud... but want to £54m Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang deal separate</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5298867/Arsenal-Borussia-Dortmund-talks-sign-Olivier-Giroud.html?ito=rss_msn</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 17:38:31 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5298867</guid><description><![CDATA[Borussia Dortmund are maintaining dialogue with Arsenal over the possibility of buying Olivier Giroud.

General Sir Nick Carter, probably the ablest Chief of the General Staff so far this century, declares that 'the parallels with 1914 are stark'. He also warns, with the direct sanction of his political boss, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, that Britain's Armed Forces are today in no state to face the threats; nor will they be, unless the Treasury finds money to plug the yawning chasm in the defence budget. Some cynics will say the service chiefs are playing a familiar game of crying wolf, warning of a 'Red Peril' in Moscow as they have done so often before, in order to secure expensive new weapons and platforms with which to posture on the international stage. Yet anybody who knows anything about defence and national security on both sides of the Atlantic understands that General Carter's depiction of the Russian threat, and of our weakness in the face of it, are all too true. Indeed, General Carter's speech was one of the toughest by a military leader for many years, and he used some chilling language.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Khaleda Rahman</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-23T14:07:33.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Putin's threat and the parallels with 1914 are all too real</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-23T14:07:33.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Vladimir Putin</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/00/4878E2A200000578-0-image-a-64_1516666833570.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/00/483CDEFD00000578-0-image-m-70_1516666877891.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1208279</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Getty Images</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5299087/Peter-Jackson-transforms-grainy-WWI-footage-make-film.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson transforms grainy 100-year-old footage to make a First World War film like you've never seen before"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5299741/Putin-clear-present-danger-Britain.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Putin is a 'clear and present danger' to Britain: Head of armed forces warns of Russia's 'eye-watering' military power and how it is using the war in Syria to test its frightening arsenal"></link></item><item><title>Arsene Wenger confirms Arsenal are in talks to sign Borussia Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as he labels Henrikh Mkhitaryan 'world class'</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5301515/Wenger-confirms-Arsenal-talks-sign-Aubameyang.html?ito=rss_msn</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2018 09:30:47 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5301515</guid><description><![CDATA[The Gunners tied up a deal for Henrikh Mkhitaryan on Monday, with Alexis Sanchez going the other way to Manchester United, and the Gabon striker could be next through the door.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Wilson said the attack was so shocking, 'even the most seasoned guides felt a little traumatised by the sight.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">It is believed that hippos sometimes commit infanticide when they are overpopulated or struggling with a form of sickness.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">The reasons for hippos to commit infanticide remain relatively unknown due to the difficulty of studying the aggressive creatures. Hippos tend to attack humans who stray too near their water pool, fearful that their calfs may be at risk from humans. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Photographer James Wilson said: 'We're not sure exactly what possessed the hippo to do this but the point is that this is the reality that is life and death in the African bush. Although we were all a little startled by what we had just seen, we knew we had been fortunate enough to witness an incredible moment in nature.' </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14.3999996185303px;">'We mostly see hippos lazing in the water with the cute tips of their ears and eyes poking out they're seemingly lazy creatures.There had been an exception shortage of rain during the wet season, but the heavens opened for two consecutive days. </span></p><img id="i-a52ccb3fec2a9974" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/08/10/12/2B3DE23100000578-3192197-The_brutal_beasts_lunged_for_the_helpless_calf_tossing_him_into_-a-56_1439205256453.jpg" height="500" width="962" alt="The brutal beasts lunged for the helpless calf, tossing him into the air without showing any remorse, leaving the water red with bloo" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14.3999996185303px;"></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'It became apparent that a mother hippo, separated from the pod, was suckling her new-born calf.

For no apparent reason the mother began backtracking something was about to go down.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He described the attack as 'a scene of complete chaos.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Recalling the shocking scenes, he said: 'Three adults launched themselves towards her and sent her fleeing for safety. The calf was left stranded on the other side while they continued to target the mother.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Suspecting the calf might be in trouble we watched as a few adult hippo cornered the mother on one side of the waterhole, while about seven hippo began moving in on the calf,' he said. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A pod of hippos normally contains between 10 to 15 large  hippos and have been known to kick out other hippos from the herd in an act of male dominance.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14.3999996185303px;">They are well known for their aggressive behaviour and have been known to kill humans if they sense danger.

Sanders then claimed that Trump deserved credit for the end of the standoff because he stood 'firm' while Democrats took a position that 'frankly was indefensible' and had to back off from it.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Hundreds of miles from home in the middle of snow-covered rural Sweden, the last thing I expected to feel was at home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, standing in the reception of Ikea Hotell, a chic-but-functional hotel run by flat-pack furniture giants Ikea, the surroundings felt strangely familiar. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It dawned on me that a large chunk of my own furniture comes from the flat-pack furniture giant - and because I built it, I like it more than many other pieces I own. I associate it with a strange sense of achievement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The hotel was exactly how you might imagine - cosy nooks and crannies, with much the same Scandinavian furniture we have in our own homes.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was given rare behind-the-scenes access to the furniture giant which saw me travel to Älmhult, Småland, where the first store opened in 1958.</p><img id="i-3dc066fa8c299573" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/09/483C15E100000578-5167009-Founder_s_footsteps_The_Ikea_Museum_is_a_treasure_trove_of_desig-a-3_1516614077137.jpg" height="357" width="634" alt="Founder's footsteps: The Ikea Museum is a treasure trove of design and innovation - here I am behind an original desk of the founder" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It truly is Ikea town – alongside the hotel is two Ikea restaurants, design studio, test lab, museum and of course, a store. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Set in woodlands an hour and a half from Malmö, it has a population under 10,000 and wonderful Nordic charm. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here I discovered Ikea's rigorous testing processes involving robotic wooden buttocks, how its comes up with those furniture names - and why we may no longer need to build its furniture with fiddly screws.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I'd argue that building a tricky wardrobe or coffee table is a good workout, physically and mentally, a sort of Ikea yoga - this innovation may make that redundant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I also found out that you can have an Ikea themed holiday – ideal for those who really are fans of the global juggernaut which has 410 stores, including 20 in Britain. It recently celebrated 30 years of being on these shores.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here are 22 secrets and titbits of information I found out on my fascinating trip to Scandinavia...</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">1. DIFFERENT GOODS NAMED AFTER CERTAIN THINGS</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The names given to products have different themes. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, flooring has Danish names, apparently so Swedes can walk on them, or so the museum tour guide joked.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other examples, shelves are boys names (such as Billy bookcase), Sofas and armchairs are Swedish districts and towns while chairs are Norwegian flowers.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">2. COUNTRIES HAVE DIFFERENT COVERS</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The photograph below may look like dozens of the same catalogue, but in fact, there are little tweaks depending on the market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, in Asian countries, the sofa is a two-seater rather than a three-seater, as that is the norm  there, while someone points out that the 2011 cover in Asia also had a toy stuffed rabbit as it was the symbol for year of the zodiac.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, inside the catalogue, the kitchen pictures for example show much bigger ones in North America as they tend to have roomier kitchen areas than elsewhere on the planet.</p><img id="i-6e0a4a4f0f3efb71" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/09/483C15E500000578-5167009-Different_markets_All_of_these_catalogue_covers_for_different_co-a-2_1516614077134.jpg" height="489" width="634" alt="Different markets: All of these catalogue covers for different countries may look the same, but there are slight differences to each" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">3. SCREWS COULD BECOME THING OF THE PAST</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ikea is working on a plan to phase out the need for fiddly allen keys, bolts and screws when assembling its furniture, I discovered while being shown around the design studio.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dotted around were many examples of furniture designs being tested with a 'wedge dowel' system which does away with the need for them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This system – which is small ribbed lumps that can be easily slotted into pre-drilled holes – will cut down the time needed to make wooden furniture without the loss of 'structural integrity.'   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can see how it works below. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is looking at ways to adapt its furniture to use it more – currently it is only used in the Regissor and Lisabo ranges. </p><video preload="none" id="5694515035442426373" title="IKEA wedge dowel innovation could spell the end of tools" poster="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/18/12/484414E500000578-0-image-a-8_1516277584055.jpg">

IT HAS A HOTEL AND SELLS MOOSE MEATBALLS</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you really love Ikea, there is perhaps nowhere better in the world to stay than the Ikea Hotel, where you can stop for a night to visit the museum and dine in its fabulous restaurant - which is a little less chaotic than those found in store.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prices start at around £100 a night and it is located in Älmhult, just an hour and a half away from both Copenhagen and Malmö.</p><img id="i-ea8198091435ac20" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/09/483C15D100000578-5167009-Moose_meatballs_The_Ikea_restaurant_is_a_gourmet_affair_with_low-a-5_1516614077173.jpg" height="435" width="306" alt="Moose meatballs: The Ikea restaurant is a gourmet affair with low prices you associate with the store" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">My room rather dramatically looked over a beautiful Scandinavian church and graveyard – and when I opened the curtains in the morning, a dusting of snow overnight made me feel like I was a detective starring in a Nordic thriller. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><span class="">Rooms are decked out in true Ikea style, while each floor has a stylish lounge kitchen where you can make hot drinks and chat to other travellers. </span> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In hotel reception, cork sinnerlig stools (which I have at home), ypperlig coffee tables and vindum rugs are dotted around, immediately making you feel like you are stepping into Ikea world.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Inside the room itself, a poäng chair (part of the Ikea line-up since the 1970s) alongside a varv lamp that charges your phone welcomed me – although the names sound odd, the furniture itself all felt very familiar. <span class=""> </span><strong></strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I thoroughly recommend the moose meatballs in the restaurant. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The dish wouldn't have been out of place in a gourmet restaurant, served with a colourful array of winter cabbage, apple and celeriac sauce, brussel sprouts, roasted seed and bacon butter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's excellent washed down with a good beer, while watching the snow fall outside.</p><img id="i-bacbf10b85e087c5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/09/483C15ED00000578-5167009-image-a-7_1516614077197.jpg" height="367" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-9e5bfb0b46a6e06a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/09/483C15F400000578-5167009-image-a-9_1516614077279.jpg" height="367" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">5. YOU CAN VISIT IKEA TOWN</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">As well as an Ikea restaurant and hotel, Älmhult also boasts the retailer's first ever store, which was opened in 1958 and converted into a museum in 2016. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its exterior remains largely unchanged and it has even kept the same flooring.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The museum offers not only an in-depth look at the history of Ikea, but also Sweden. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was a relatively poor nation at the turn of the 20th century with 25 per cent of its young population moving out between 1840 and 1910.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It showcases Ikea furniture through the decades, showing how our tastes have changed, and bits of Ikea history, such as the desk of the founder Ingvar Kamprad. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I could easily have spent three or four hours in there taking it all in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can even become the cover star and have your photograph taken for your own version of the Ikea catalogue. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The shop also sells Ikea products you won't find elsewhere - I picked up a rather natty poster and some little Christmas decorations.</p><img id="i-7e5b351af4e4a13a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/09/483C15C500000578-5167009-Cover_star_You_can_have_a_photograph_taken_and_star_on_the_front-a-4_1516614077145.jpg" height="433" width="634" alt="Cover star: You can have a photograph taken and star on the front cover - the layout is very similar to the current catalogue. Yes, I'm pretending to write with a giant pencil" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">6. FOUNDER'S STORY IS HOLLYWOOD MATERIAL</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">There would be no Ikea without its founder Ingvar Kamprad. The retailer is named after him - made up as his initials and those of the farm on which he grew up - Elmtaryd Agunnaryd.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ingvar Kamprad's story is a real rollercoaster-ride of great successes and troublesome obstacles.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He started out as a businessman from an early age, dealing in goods such as ballpoint pens. </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">He eventually settled on furniture and his mantra was to help kit out homes for modern families but at an 'everyday' affordable price.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ikea started life as a mail order business and 285,000 brochures were sent to Swedish homes in 1951. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When he opened the first store in 1958, 1,000 people turned up, lured in the by the size of the place – and free cinnamon buns and coffee.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There have been a number of obstacles in the way, including outrage from other furniture dealers, as you'd expect for a major global company.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The museum offers excellent insight into the story of Ingvar and Ikea.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The book The Ikea Story by Bertil Torekull, which I picked up for a couple of quid in the museum is also an interesting read that explains it all in in-depth detail. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I think his adventures are worthy of a MacDonalds/The Founder type movie.</p><img id="i-8e22d4b2fff16edd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/09/483C15C900000578-5167009-Test_lab_Maybe_my_favourite_part_of_the_visit_the_ways_the_test_-a-8_1516614077208.jpg" height="357" width="634" alt="Test lab: Maybe my favourite part of the visit, the ways the test lab put products through their paces was fascinating" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">7. FAKE BUTTOCKS IN THE TEST LAB ON SOFAS</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of my favourite parts of the visit was the behind the scenes look at the testing lab. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Inside was a myriad of tests to put products through their paces before being unleashed on the public. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Älmhult, it has 500 separate tests for products, while it has another test lab in Shanghai, China, which has 820 tests.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When I stepped in, there was a robotic arm painstaking opening and closing the lid of a children's novelty lunchbox. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It will repeat this millions of times to test how long it will last - imagine how long it would take for someone to do that manually.</p><img id="i-898aec125aef240" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/09/48434CFD00000578-5167009-Hypnotic_The_light_bulb_room_stretched_far_and_wide_with_robots_-a-6_1516614077173.jpg" height="357" width="634" alt="Hypnotic: The light bulb room stretched far and wide, with robots turning them on and off" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Elsewhere, there is a room containing 3,000 light bulbs which are tested for 600 hours. Again, robots turn them on and off.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Candles are left burning in another section to see how they burn while a giant steel vat sets alight to bedding to assess its flammability.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Inside another part of the lab, pairs of fake buttocks operated by robots, are pushed up and down on chairs and sofas to test how long it will take for it to break, with each push with 100kg of weight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I wasn't allowed to take many photographs in this part of the tour, as many of the products being tested are not yet in Ikea stores, but I was allowed to take the video below - it shows a roller going back and forth on a bed, to see how long it will take to break. The machine will do this for days.</p><video preload="none" id="2355612577824918764" title="The hypnotic mattress testing device at the top secret Ikea lab" poster="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/17/17/483C5DE700000578-0-image-m-11_1516211763925.jpg">

  </video><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">8. TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED ROOMS</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Additionally in the testing lab, Ikea showed me temperature controlled rooms in which furniture, such as bathroom cabinets, is placed  to mimic conditions around the world - from humid Asia to cooler North America.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It can then see how furniture holds up in different climates to make sure they have the quality needed to meet these markets.  </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">9. IT DIDN'T INVENT FLATPACK FURNITURE</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shock horror - Ikea didn't invent flatpack furniture, the product it has become synonymous with today.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The founder says that the first company with the basic idea was NK in Stockholm, an upmarket department store that still exists today.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It had a series of 'knockdown' furniture, the basic concept of flatpack, in the late 1950s - but Mr Kamprad was the one who realised the idea was commercial dynamite. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The large driver behind the Ikea flatpack revolution is a designer called Gillis Lundgren - he was able to 'pull off the legs' and put them under the tabletop, creating Ikea's first ever flatpack furniture. It never looked back.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">10. BUILD FROM PRICE BACKWARDS</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ikea has a secret area above its design studios which houses future products lined up to launch at various points of the year - and it stretches far into the future.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I can't reveal too much of what I saw, but can tell you this: it works on a price point first, before designing a product. It will have a brief - for example, in the second half of 2019, it might want a new chair to launch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The price of this chair is set first before anything else is decided. It then develops the product to suit that price. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Product developers and designers work directly with suppliers to ensure that creating the low prices starts on the factory floor.</p><img id="i-b8edb57df9d97a0a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/09/483C15FE00000578-5167009-image-a-11_1516614077338.jpg" height="556" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-dfadb710680dd880" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/09/483C15F900000578-5167009-image-a-12_1516614077339.jpg" height="556" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">11. IKEA HAS SECRET FUTURISTIC LAB IN DENMARK</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Copenhagen's trendy Meatpacking District, Ikea funds a futurist 'laboratory' called Space 10, which looks to tackle human problems of the future.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here designers get their head together to find forward-thinking solutions to issues such as housing demands and food supply for a growing global population. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One such idea is the 'globe grower'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is a large, wooden construction to enable people to grow their own food in a local and sustainable way. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead of selling and shipping the product to customers, Space 10 allows them to download it on their computer as an open source design.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They can then build it themselves using just a rubber hammer, 17 sheets of plywood, and a CNC milling machine - a commonly-used machine that cuts wood to spec.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So far, 20,000 people have downloaded it around the world – and more designs could soon be downloaded in this manner and then built, using, for example, a 3D printing machine. </p><img id="i-2f0bed06f260b33a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/09/4843333800000578-5167009-Globe_grower_People_around_the_world_can_download_the_design_and-a-10_1516614077309.jpg" height="416" width="634" alt="Globe grower: People around the world can download the design and make it themselves - and the plan is more future products will have the same downloadable format" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">12. IT HAS A FARMER WORKING IN THE BASEMENT</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The lab also has a farmer who grows food in the basement. Ikea is big on food, selling hundreds of millions of meatball per year, for example, and it is keen to help find sustainable food solutions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We are expected globally to need 70 per cent more food within the next 35 years and in this basement, to the backdrop of classical music, an array of herbs and edible plants are grown using artificial light and with fewer bugs, meaning no pesticides.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They require 90 per cent less water to irrigate, according to the farmer, and Ikea will soon go to the next level, growing mushrooms, tomatoes and chillis. There is even a fish pond in the corner with the excretion being used as fertilizer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Upstairs, Space 10 has a development chef that uses all of the produce grown  to create tasty dishes for staff to taste test.

IKEA VISITS HOMES FOR IDEAS</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Every year, Ikea visits thousands of homes of average owners around the world, to see how people live within the radius of a store, to help shape what it sells.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, homes in Tokyo are very small, so it is likely to sell more genius storage solutions, meanwhile, in Wembley, London, many of the room layouts in store are for children/parent rooms, it says, as many people live in homes where the child lives in the bedroom with the parents.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">15. JUST 1% OF PROTOTYPES ARE MADE </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to one of Ikea's designers, just one per cent of prototypes that its makes ever make it into stores – and it takes on average three years to finally be available to buy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the design lab at the Ikea centre in Älmhult, there are various prototype rooms for materials such as fabric, wood and metal, where some of the prototypes that are designed are made, so designers can get a feel for what they have created on screen. </p><img id="i-975521035828a22" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/09/483C15D900000578-5167009-image-a-15_1516614077381.jpg" height="357" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-dafbb5e91424192d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/09/483C15D500000578-5167009-Say_cheese_The_Ikea_photo_studio_is_one_of_the_biggest_in_Europe-a-13_1516614077348.jpg" height="357" width="634" alt="Say cheese! The Ikea photo studio is one of the biggest in Europe - and it was like being in a soap opera set" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">16. PHOTO STUDIO AMONG BIGGEST IN EUROPE</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">I took a sneak peek into one of the biggest photo studios in Europe – this is where rooms are dressed and shot for the catalogue and website. It is 8,000 square meters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's a bit like the set of a soap opera or television show, with stairs that lead to nowhere and room sets that look alien in a huge warehouse setting. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many of the nearly 200,000 strong Ikea staff - know affectionately as Ikeans - star in the catalogues rather than paying for models. </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">17. MUCH OF THE CATALOGUE ARE NOW 3D IMAGES</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">A fifth of all pictures in the catalogue are actually 3D renderings – and the aim is to get more of the catalogue each year shot this way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This means, for example, that changing the size of a kitchen with the white goods is much easier than having to keep redressing and resizing the room set. </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">18. SUSTAINABILITY IS IMPORTANT</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sustainability is at the heart of Ikea. It has a sort of catchphrase plastered around its offices which is 'democratic design'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These are five pillars that its furniture adheres to: nice form, functional, low price, quality and sustainability.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A few ways it says it has helped reduce its impact on the environment is by switching its lighting products to use LEDs, saving 3.3billion kwh per year of power.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last year, it achieved zero waste to landfill in the UK for the first time and turns a profit from waste, with recycled materials forming parts of its best-selling products.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has designed bathroom taps that use 50 per cent less water while the food storage bags it sells is made from renewable material from the sugar cane industry, rather than plastic. </p><img id="i-6fd4a672ce79a714" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/09/483C15E900000578-5167009-Democratic_design_I_got_the_impression_that_sustainability_is_an-a-14_1516614077362.jpg" height="357" width="634" alt="Democratic design: I got the impression that sustainability is an important part of Ikea's future" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">19. WOMEN RISE TO THE TOP</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nearly half of all store managers worldwide are female. In its Sweden office, it encourages equal parenting, daycare is free for their children and there is plenty of flexibility for both new fathers and mothers.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Overall, the company employs roughly 50/50 men and women.   </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">20. WOOD IS TRACKED TO SOURCE</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Incredibly, Ikea uses one per cent of all industrial wood in the world. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Forestry specialists go to the forests where the wood is cut down to check the quality and make sure conditions are good.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It sources its wood from 50 different countries, mostly from Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Russia and Sweden itself. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has something called 'IWAY' which is basically clear requirements that wood cannot be illegally harvested from sources involved in forest-related social conflicts or from conservation areas.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Additionally, it is aiming to get more of its wood from sustainable sources. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, recycled wood and wood from Forest Stewardship Council certified places increased to 50 per cent in 2015. It is aiming for 100 per cent by 2020.   </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">21. EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT TO FURNITURE</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to a senior staff member at Ikea, research of its customers show that people have an emotional attachment to the furniture - because they have built it themselves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For this reason, people are likely to hold onto Ikea furniture for longer than average - they don't want their hard work to go to waste. It appears I'm not alone in my strange sense of Ikea building achievement.  </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">22. QUARTER OF STOCK REPLACED EACH YEAR</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Ikea range consist of over 10,000 items. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Approximately 15-25 per cent is replaced every year – and it boils down to popularity and sales.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>We were given rare behind the scenes access to Ikea and visited Älmhult, Sweden, to see its design studios and testing labs, while staying at its only hotel.

In an expression of that snub, Abbas overlapped with Pence in Jordan from Saturday evening to midday Sunday, when the Palestinian leader flew to Brussels for a meeting with European Union foreign ministers.

'Whoever is not ready to talk with the Americans about peace - does not want peace,' he said Sunday at a meeting of ambassadors in Jerusalem.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said Pence's speech on Monday 'has proven that the U.S. administration is part of the problem rather than the solution'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Earlier Monday, Pence placed his right hand over his heart as an honor guard greeted him with the American national anthem. White House Mideast envoy Jason Greenblatt, U.S. Ambassador David Friedman and the Israeli ambassador to Washington, Ron Dermer, joined the ceremony, and Pence chatted briefly with Israeli soldiers before beginning his meeting with Netanyahu.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pence said he was grateful to be representing Trump and that his decision to designate Jerusalem as the Israeli capital would 'create an opportunity to move on in good faith negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The vice president said he was hopeful 'we are at the dawn of a new era of renewed discussions to achieve a peaceful resolution to a decades-long conflict.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prior to his arrival, Pence visited Egypt and Jordan, where he was warned by King Abdullah II that he had to 'rebuild trust and confidence' after the Jerusalem move. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Scuffles have broken out in the Israeli Knesset as Arab lawmakers staged a protest while Vice-President Mike Pence said the U.S will move its embassy to Jerusalem ahead of schedule.

She pointedly warned ministers not to air grievances in public at a tense Cabinet meeting where the Foreign Secretary led a revolt on the crucial issue. Mrs May (pictured inset at a Burns Night event last night) also made clear any 'Brexit dividend' for the NHS will not be considered until next year. The dramatic clash came after arch-Eurosceptic Mr Johnson (pictured left leaving No10 today) demanded a £5billion cash injection for the health service as soon as we leave the EU. Brexiteer ministers such as Michael Gove, Andrea Leadsom and Penny Mordaunt are keen to demonstrate that the Leave campaign's referendum pledge of significant extra money for the NHS is being kept. But it is understood Mr Johnson stopped short of mentioning figures during the meeting, after the PM and a string of allies told the gathering that conversations should be conducted in private. One Cabinet member told ITV that Mrs May ‘bitch slapped’ the Foreign Secretary, although other sources argued that there had been broad support for his plea for more funding.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>James Tapsfield</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-23T15:27:02.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>PM orders Boris to button it over demands for NHS 'Brexit dividend'</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-23T15:27:02.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Brexit,NHS,Philip Hammond,Boris Johnson</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/15/4880490100000578-0-image-a-6_1516720529086.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/10/487DC01100000578-0-image-m-22_1516702446332.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5296533/Ukip-deputy-quits-protest-Henry-Bolton-s-refusal-go.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Farage BACKS Henry Bolton to stay in charge of Ukip saying he can be ‘the party’s Jeremy Corbyn’ by winning over ordinary members... but party chiefs stop the under-fire leader's pay "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5295721/Channel-4-drops-Chinese-cash-Brexit-Tory-expos.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Channel 4 pulls 'cash for Brexit' TV exposé: Investigation into former Tory Cabinet ministers accused of offering advice to Chinese companies is dropped at the eleventh hour"></link></item><item><title>Another Kollection?
