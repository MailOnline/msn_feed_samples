<p class="mol-para-with-font">When you're considering making renovations to your home, often the thought of adding value to the property when it comes to selling can be a deciding factor. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, experts have revealed that while most improvements will increase the potential asking price, the added value is not always greater than what you spend in the first place. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">GoCompare has teamed up with property expert Henry Pryor who is a regular fixture on <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/bbc/index.html" id="mol-e8829ea0-6998-11e8-a660-fd9861a9f977">BBC</a> Breakfast and Radio 4's Today programme, to identify the upgrades that are really worth your money. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His findings reveal that the most profitable home improvement is installing a new boiler for a cost of £2,000 which will add £8,000 in value, making you a profit of £6,000. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Increasing home security and energy saving measures are also worth your while, but updating bathrooms and kitchens and putting in new flooring won't add more value than what you've spent, leaving you at a loss. </p><img id="i-6cf53ba52423b9b8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/15/4CF97CE100000578-0-image-a-51_1528294216052.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="Installing a new boiler is the most profitable addition you can make to your home, adding £8,000 in value for the cost of less than £2,000" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's therefore that you think carefully why you are spending extra money and who will benefit,' he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'My advice is usually 'spend money on the things that you want and leave other improvements to the next person who may not share your taste. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Most people who are thinking of selling their home or looking to improve it to add value will consider the merits of a trip to the DIY store, some will even consider doing some building work in the hope of adding value but not all buyers will be prepared to pay for your idea of improvements or good taste. </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox femail"

She said that you should always dream big and ask yourself - 'What if your life could be anything that you wanted it to be? What if you could achieve anything that you set your mind to?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alyse said it was a lot of trial and error as well as experimenting with new things but she tries to think of everything as a learning experience because, 'even if something didn't do so well there's always something I can learn from it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A  very important piece of the puzzle that has allowed Alyse to continue growing and expanding she admits is accepting help which she has done a lot over the past few years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I have accepted help from so many different people in so many different ways. The truth is that I haven't done this all on my own that's just not possible. When we open up ourselves and accept help from others we're also opening up ourselves to so much more growth.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for people who are too scared to ask for help, Alyse said, 'I know that it could be hard to ask for support and accept help from others but if we want to grow at a more rapid rate it's essential to allow yourself to receive help.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fourth is prioritizing health which she says  is so important when it comes to manifesting your dreams and achieving your goals.</p><mol-permabox id="mol-5698bfc0-6988-11e8-a04c-7523876330f5"></mol-permabox><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Nutrition is incredibly important because fueling and nourishing your body will help you thrive. Less process food and more fresh food as well as figuring out how many hours of sleep is ideal for you and getting in tune with your body is essential she says. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When I'm feeling good in my mind as well as my body and I feel like I have a clear head, I feel like things manifest and happen so much quicker and easier,' she admits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lastly, Alyse says believing in yourself is key as well as becoming aware of your limiting beliefs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I have spent years trying to get those limiting thoughts and beliefs out of my head. Change the voice in your head and change the story. I can't stress enough how important it is to positively affirm what you are capable of instead of telling yourself that you're not worthy, you're not capable and you're not deserving,' Alyse shared.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You literally need to train yourself to think differently and more positively even if it feels like a lie in the beginning continue on with it anyway. Every single day wake up and tell yourself "I am capable and I am worthy of living in abundance and fulfillment in every single aspect of life,"' she continued.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Alyse Brautigam dropped out of college to pursue her dreams of living in Hawaii arriving with just $500 to her name.

Salad Cream to Sandwich Cream after 104 years on the market. Many argued that there was no logic in renaming the product based on how customers used it, and made their own cheeky suggestions for rebranding. Others said that while they were prepared to accept some rebranding this was a step too far.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Martha Cliff</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T12:44:58.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Salad Cream fans up in arms over Heinz’s plans to rebrand</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T12:44:58.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/food/article-5808543/Channel-4-Supershoppers-dairy-free-milks-contain-sugar-cows-milk.html" title="Revealed: How 'healthy' dairy-free alternatives can contain more sugar than COW'S milk (and one coffee shop's vegan latte has the equivalent of five spoons of sugar)"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/food/article-5810933/Big-Mack-Pie-Queensland-favourite-takes-spin-traditional-meat-pie.html" title="Step aside, McDonald's - there's a new Big Mack in town: Award-winning meat pie puts a VERY unconventional spin on the Australian classic"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/food/article-5810161/Would-try-broccoli-coffee.html" title="Would YOU try broccoli coffee?

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">(Ditto the man who still lives with his parents and has never left home – not that this applies to Grant, but just so you know.)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Grant is often compared to the other (former) famous bachelor, George Clooney, but George did have a brief marriage to actress Talia Balsam before he married Amal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Grant has made no secret of the fact he's not a fan of marriage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Do I think humans are meant to be in a 40-year-long faithful relationship?

true commitment phobia is a fear of any kind of commitment that involves other people – not just relationship commitment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Grant was with Liz Hurley for 13 years which is – let's face it - longer than a lot of people's marriages.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He dated socialite Jemima Khan for three years and others for years at a time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More importantly, he and Liz have remained close friends ever since the split with Grant godfather to her son Damian.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He has five children in total: two with former partner Tinglan Hong and three with his now wife.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He reputedly met Tinglan in the bar, had a 'fleeting affair' (according to a statement by his publicist) and the pregnancy was an accident.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He could easily have contested it but didn't.</p><img id="i-871289f34eb1d07d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/16/00E7D1EC00000190-5807887-image-m-21_1528212373002.jpg" height="820" width="634" alt="She points out that Hugh dated Liz Hurley for 13 years, and the pair remained friends after separating with Hugh acting as godfather to her son" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-a3717e5bd8d154a1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/16/064FE4C50000044D-5807887-image-a-22_1528212394771.jpg" height="935" width="634" alt="The actor also dated socialite Jemima Khan for three years and others for years at a time" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Grant might conduct his relationships in a way most don't.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As I said, both Tinglan and Anna were pregnant with his sons at the same time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His first child with Anna, John Mungo, was born in September 2012; his second child with Tinglan, Felix, was born three months later in December 2012.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This didn't come out until a year later, when Grant signed a birth certificate as John Mungo's father, and he was caught on camera seeing both women, apparently simultaneously.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But he didn't shirk his responsibility, acknowledges paternity of all his children and supports them financially.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also has a circle of close friends he's known for years, who are all fiercely supportive of him: few, if any, commitment-phobes can say the same.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They tend to shy away from intimate involvement with anyone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Why now?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So even if he's not a commitment phobe, Grant certainly wasn't a fan of marriage - why bother with a ceremony he doesn't really believe in, six years and three kids into a relationship, three years off hitting 60?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I think it's this simple: the timing is right for him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some people want what he's just signed up for at 25, others don't fancy it until 57.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I got married (albeit for the second time) when I was 55 because I didn't find the person I truly wanted to spend the rest of my life with until then.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sometimes it takes that long – especially if you've got a lot of other stuff going on, like a career.</p><img id="i-2c8fb8a43f845ca2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/16/4CF0A78A00000578-5807887-image-a-23_1528212422114.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Tracey says a partner who is a great mother, as Anna is to three of Hugh's children, is a compelling reason to rethink old beliefs" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Post 50, there's less need to prove ourselves, our libidos calm down and we start to realise our own mortality.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In short, we want different things from life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Things that did not appeal to me at all pre-50 – routine, familiarity, being able to second-guess how your partner will react in pretty much all situations – I now find hugely attractive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Which is a good thing because marriage is all about routine and predictability.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's also reassuring that Grant got married six years into his relationship with Anna.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Saying 'I do' to someone, six years and three children in, is a much stronger, more realistic commitment than one made when you're in the heavy idealization stage of a new relationship, brains flooded with love and sex hormones that remove rational judgement and thought.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having five children also changes you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Grant is known for being miserable and nothing like the dippy, happy characters he played in Richard Curtis movies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Having these kids has transformed him from a very miserable person into a fairly miserable person,' said Hurley, ironically, recently.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's improved him.

exciting parts of becoming a new parent. However, due to a number of unusual and offensive choices made by parents in the past, governments in both Australia and New Zealand have had to ban a number of 'names' from being registered. Here, FEMAIL looks at the names banned from use across the two countries and reasons why certain monikers have been prohibited. Names like Saint (top right is Saint West with Kim Kardashian) and Queen (bottom right is Queen Elizabeth) are banned due to royal and religious connotations.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Sheree Mutton</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T08:47:19.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>The baby names BANNED after parents tried to use them</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T08:47:19.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5801823/Constance-Hall-shares-post-baby-bump-just-days-giving-birth-son-Raja-Wolf.html" title="'I still look six months pregnant but I'm going to flaunt it everywhere I go': Constance Hall shares photo of her post-baby bump to break stigma for new mums just days after giving birth to her son Raja Wolf"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5769565/The-Australian-baby-names-2018-revealed.html" title="From Bodhi and Jude to Luna and Isla: The top Australian baby names for 2018 revealed - and the monikers that are gone for GOOD"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.bdm.vic.gov.au/home/births/name+your+child/" title="Name your child - Births, Deaths &amp; Marriages Victoria"></link></item><item><title>Forget perfectly arranged kitchen pantries, coffee stations are the next big thing: Mothers hit Kmart to create incredible spaces to enjoy their morning brews</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5810685/Kmart-coffee-stations-big-thing-Mothers-creating-incredible-spaces.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 03:00:58 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5810685</guid><description><![CDATA[Forget the perfectly arranged kitchen pantries, coffee connoisseurs are creating spaces to enjoy their morning brews.

But dukedom can only be inherited by male children — not female — regardless of birth order. So if Harry and Meghan — who are rumored to want to start a family right away — welcome a boy as their first child, he will one day inherit his dad's title, Duke of Sussex. But if there first child is a girl, she will simply be called 'Lady'. In 2013, the Succession to the Crown Act changed the law regarding succession to the throne so it is based on birth order, regardless of gender. This means that William and Kate's daughter, Princess Charlotte, follows her older brother George in the line of succession to the throne, however that law applies to those in line for the crown, not members of the peerage.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Charlie Lankston</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-05T01:54:15.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Prince Harry &amp; Meghan's future daughter won't inherit a title</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-05T01:54:15.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Royals,Prince Harry,Meghan Markle</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5804919/Meghan-Markles-chef-ex-expecting-child-singer-girlfriend.html" title="Moving on!

DON'T APPLY EYELINER ON THE INNER LASH LINE </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While the tightlining technique is all the rage on beauty blogs, Mr Arundel warns against this cosmetic method. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Optometrists call the fragile skin around the eyes 'periocular skin' and they have a strong opinion about where on that skin you should apply your eyeliner,' he said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There has even been a small study to set the record straight about the dangers of what beauticians refer to as 'waterlining' or 'tightlining' which is applying eyeliner inside your lower lash line.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The study quantified the migration of a conventional cosmetic eye pencil in two different locations: behind the lash line and inside the lash line (the waterline). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The results showed the glitter particles of the pencil eyeliner migrated more readily and contaminated the tear film when applied inside the waterline. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Arundel said this has 'implications for contact wearers and patients with dry eye syndrome or sensitive eyes'. </p><img id="i-c4b6d7644d4237c1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/29/09/40E818FA00000578-4551502-image-a-2_1496048207375.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Optometry Australia's resident optometrist, Luke Arundel, has seen first-hand the damage caused by cosmetic mistakes and shared his top beauty tips to help women avoid eye  damage" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. THROW OUT YOUR MAKE UP AFTER THE EXPIRY DATE </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While many people keep their make up for a long while, this could be causing serious damage to their eyes.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'A study published in the International Journal of Cosmetic Science found 97.9 per cent of participants reported using or previously using make-up after the expiration date, with mascara being the most frequently mentioned product,' Mr Arundel said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Yet, the microbiological analysis of 40 mascara samples revealed the presence of bacteria and fungi which can cause nasty bacterial eye infections.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'By law, cosmetic manufacturers don't have to put a use-by date on their products. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, you can check a product's official expiry date by running the batch code through checkfresh.com or apps like Check Your Cosmetics.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. BE CAREFUL WITH EYELASH EXTENSIONS </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eyelash extensions have skyrocketed in popularity of late... but they can be risky. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Mr Arundel, risks associated with this beauty trend include infections of the cornea and eyelid, the permanent or temporary loss of eyelashes, eyelid swelling and allergic reactions. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There has been a steady increase in the number of cases associated with allergic reactions to the glue used to adhere extensions to existing lashes, the loss of natural eyelashes, conjunctivitis and even corneal damage due to tweezer injury,' Mr Arundel said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Repeated use of eyelash extensions can cause tractional alopecia, where the natural lash falls out due to excessive tension and weight placed on the hair shaft.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This can damage the hair follicle, which can slow down or cease any further production of natural lashes.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Arundel says that if women insist on the extensions, they should ensure that their beauty therapist has been trained in this procedure, that the equipment used has been sterilised and that the environment where the procedure will take place is clean.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They should ask their therapist what glue they will use and avoid places that only use formaldehyde-based adhesives as these are often linked to allergic reactions,' he added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If there is any discomfort after the procedure, any noticeable inflammation of the eyelid, grittiness, blurred vision or loss of the natural eyelashes, you should see your optometrist immediately.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4. TAKE CARE WITH NOVELTY CONTACT LENSES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A popular accessory on Halloween, novelty contact lenses are a popular beauty buy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But they can also cause serious damage to the surface of your eye. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Halloween can be a scary time for optometrists, for all the wrong reasons. Buying novelty lenses online or over the counter can lead to eye infections, damage, and even permanent blindness,' Mr Arundel said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The surface of the eye is extremely delicate and wearing non-prescribed novelty contact lenses, particularly those from a dubious source, could cause eye damage ranging from mild infections to sight-threatening conditions such as corneal scarring and even blindness. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Contact lenses are not 'one size fits all'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It is important to make sure the lenses are prescribed by an optometrist who will measure each eye to properly fit the lenses and evaluate how the eye responds to contact lens wear using a microscope. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The optometrist will then instruct them on appropriate insertion and removal techniques and correct contact lens care to minimise the risk of irreversible eye damage.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5. GET YOUR EYES TESTED </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many people put up with sore, teary and itchy eyes for months before even thinking about getting them tested. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Arundel said if these symptoms persist, people should be getting their eyes tested by an optometrist within a few days. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You may think your vision is fine or that your eyes are healthy, but visiting an optometrist for a comprehensive eye examination is the only way to really be sure,' he explained. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Not only may it lead to improved everyday vision – and quality of life – it could detect that something more serious is going on, and prevent loss of vision. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If you can squeeze in the time to see a beautician, you can manage an appointment with an optometrist.' </p>                            </div>                        </div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Theresa Lynch, 50, from Sydney, (left) sought medical advice after suffering an uncomfortable sensation beneath her eyelids (inset, Theresa with swollen eyelids).

Cut your carbs</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If you choose the right types of carbohydrates and consume them at the right times, carb-rich foods can be a nutrient-rich boost to any diet. On the other hand, the wrong types of processed carbs such as white breads, refined grains and sugars consumed at the wrong time equates to abdominal weight gain. For most of us, this will translate to a 1/2 cup or two of wholegrain low glycaemic index carbs such as quinoa, oats, sweet potato, brown rice or fruit at breakfast and lunch, and cutting right back at night - instead focusing your evening meal around protein and plenty of vegetables.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. Get rid of little extras</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It might be a slice of banana bread with your coffee once a week, or the cheese and crackers while you prepare dinner - the mindless munching habits regularly see us consuming a couple of hundred extra calories per day. Once you cut this out and stick to three meals along with one or two snacks each day, you will drop an extra kilo or two quickly.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. Stop eating so late</strong>      </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The more calories we consume later in the day, and the heavier the food choices (wine, chocolate, after dinner treats, fast food meals picked up late at night), the more likely the hormones that will store fat are circulating in our bloodstream. For this reason, eating your final meal of the day as early as possible, and keeping your food choices light after 7pm is an easy way to help to eat away at tummy fat. Think white fish, salads, soups and vegetables.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4. Cut the grog</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'While alcohol itself may not directly cause weight gain (or prevent fat loss), the foods we tend to enjoy while we are enjoying a few drinks like the dips, chips, cheese and fried foods are less likely to be burnt off in the presence of alcohol. Alcohol also contains almost as many calories as fat per gram.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5. Drink right</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Any type of concentrated liquid sugar - fruit juice, smoothies, coconut water, sports drinks, energy drinks, hot chocolates, chai lattes and iced coffees - all result in a relatively large carbohydrate load in the bloodstream and subsequently a high release of the hormone insulin. Insulin acts to prevent fat being broken down and used as energy and also contributes to fat being stores around the abdomen. For this reason, any drive to lose tummy fat should minimise the intake of liquid sugars. In place of this, a few cups of herbal tea along with two to three litres of filtered water is a key step to support optimal hydration and appetite management when fat loss is the goal.'</p>                            </div>                        </div><img id="i-34c422e2e80075e5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/01/4C282A8100000578-5722325-To_combat_getting_a_stressed_out_stomach_experts_recommend_cutti-a-12_1526169697092.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="To combat getting a stressed out stomach, experts recommend cutting down on junk and caffeine and making sure you get seven to eight hours of sleep each night (stock image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>STRESSED OUT STOMACH</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's long been known that stress can lead to weight gain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Stress does not solely result in fat being stored, although it can result in changes in various hormones linked to fat metabolism including insulin and cortisol - or more likely the feeding behaviours in which stressed people soothe with food,' Susie said.</p><img id="i-5b2820a796fddf67" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/01/4C282CF200000578-5722325-Susie_pictured_recommends_you_eat_carbs_earlier_in_the_day_for_a-a-14_1526169697316.jpg" height="330" width="306" alt="Susie (pictured) recommends you eat carbs earlier in the day for a flat stomach" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Again, the tummy weight is more pronounced.

If you are at a point in which you are ready to take it on, the approach is threefold.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Cut back on your carbs, resume regular high intensity training (walking won't cut it here) and you may also benefit from seeing a physio, who can help you get your muscles back on track after carrying a baby.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Susie said plenty of vegetables, salads and soups will 'help to lower calorie intake and burn body fat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Avoiding all processed carbs and sugar will also help hugely.' </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Whether you describe it as a paunch or a muffin top, if you've got a protruding stomach and want to get rid of it the first step is identifying what's causing it.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">If you were to film a standard sex session with most couples in the world, 95 percent of men would be thrusting in the conventional way: in-out-in-out (yawn) in-out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Same speed, same depth, same hip motion, same everything.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not only is this boring, this style of thrusting is hopelessly ineffective at bringing most women to orgasm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Traditional thrusting also speeds up his orgasm – another bad idea since women generally take much longer than men to climax.</p><img id="i-867734331b4abec8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/13/19/4A292D5200000578-5495709-image-a-23_1520968717172.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Relationship expert Tracey Cox has revealed how you can improve your sex life by trying out a new thrusting technique" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Because this style is so much the norm, is it any wonder lots of women rate intercourse as the least interesting part of sex?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s also the reason why a new thrusting style can transform tried-and-tired sex into a fresh, feisty passionate encounter with one twist of a hip.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you really want to impress though, we need to dust off the ancient and world-famous sex book: the Kama Sutra.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Contrary to popular opinion, the Kama Sutra isn’t all about sex or wacky positions: it’s a guide to life and love with only one of its seven parts focusing on the erotic.</p><img id="i-d129f1334b2e12c4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/13/19/4A292D1D00000578-5495709-image-a-24_1520968726392.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Tracey draws on the Kama Sutra, the ancient and world-famous sex book, for the tips" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But thrusting is one area where it’s particularly inspiring, offering up not one but 10 different thrusting strokes for you to choose from.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While I wouldn’t suggest trying to accomplish all of these techniques in one session (you’ll see what I mean when you read on), it’s well worth committing them to memory to add much-needed variety to mundane intercourse... </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Rubbing</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>You raise your hips by putting a pillow under your bum, he thrusts in a rising (upward) motion.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lots of sexologists (me included) find a multitude of problems solved by putting firm pillows under bottoms, arms, heads, legs and various other body parts. It makes everything more accessible and comfortable and alters angles with interesting results.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Seriously – try it! It’s simple but transformational.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS femail" data-version="2" id="mol-651e8ed0-26f3-11e8-89c2-7df667259b9d">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">How do I stop him falling out when I’m on top? </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lots of women hate being on top and the one in charge of thrusting because they worry about him slipping out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here’s the truth: it probably will because it’s normal!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s nothing to do with penis size, it just happens in certain positions and angles and depends on what thrusting style you’re using.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The trick is to go easy on the lube, keep thrusting slow, don’t lift too high so he stays deep inside you and keep your pelvises close.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let him know you’re going to be the one in control, so you’re not both thrusting at different times or in different ways and, if you’re really worried, hang onto the base of it with your hand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If his penis is curved, grind or thrust against the curve not with it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’re on top facing his feet, lean back towards his chest, not forward towards his feet; if you’re on top facing his head, lean back slightly or lean forward to create a 90 degree angle, then go all the way up and all the way down slowly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Again, aim to grind your pelvis in a circular motion rather than lift up and down; rocking against each other also works well.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If it does slip out – which is will from time to time – don’t worry, just use your hands to put it back in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Pressing</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The original Kama Sutra text says he should press his penis ‘excitedly’ into your womb and hold it there.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At first, this seems like a contradiction in terms. Like, if he’s super-excited, the last thing on his mind is holding still…unless of course, you’re trying to decrease the level of excitement and delay ejaculation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clever old Vatsyayana (the man rumoured to have penned the Kama Sutra) - this is exactly when he suggests you use it!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Churning</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>He grasps his penis in his hand, at the base, then moves it in circles inside you.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, it is totally ‘doable’ hands-free, but you’ll get a lot more pressure inside by him hanging on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another variation of churning: he holds his penis and you lie back while he rubs the soft head of it over your clitoris until you’re close to orgasm. At the last minute, he penetrates and, still holding his penis, ‘churns’ it in circles.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Double-edged sword</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>He strikes sharply downwards.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is the opposite to modern thinking which has brainwashed both of you to always aim for the front vaginal wall (the bit under the belly) because that’s where the G -spot is.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Try this for a totally different sensation and remember, the Kama Sutra isn’t orgasm focused so has different aims – it’s as much about connection and sensation as it is climaxes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Buffeting</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>He pulls out completely and then penetrates again with a fast, hard stroke. Some women (like me) wince rather than melt at the thought of this one.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’ve got a sensitive cervix that likes to know what’s coming (ahem) and he’s rather well endowed, unexpected, deep penetration means pain rather than pleasure. Gingerly test this one out if you’re not overly keen on deep penetration.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Boar’s blow</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>He puts continuous pressure on one side of the vagina.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not as barking as it sounds given recent evidence shows one side of the clitoris is nearly always more sensitive on most women.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s not wild conjecture to imagine the same applies elsewhere.<strong> </strong></p><img id="i-5c1d52fcfa0c331d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/13/19/49EFFBB700000578-5495709-image-a-25_1520968759285.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Couples should stop focusing on hitting the G-spot and instead try other angles, Tracey says" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Bull’s blow</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>He thrusts wildly in all directions like a bull tossing his horns.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It should go without saying that attempting this one too early on, could mean the whole things over before you can say ‘That feels grea…’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sporting of a sparrow</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>He makes rapid, shallow in and out strokes.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Same advice as above: if he’s close to climax and desperately focusing on an image of his aesthetically challenged mother-in-law in big, grey pants, not great timing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Save it for when he’s more in control.</p><img id="i-8ac5491a37865c4a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/13/19/4A293DDA00000578-5495709-image-a-37_1520970062501.jpg" height="469" width="306" alt="Tracey Cox, pictured, also explains why keeping your pelvises together can increase pleasure for you and your partner" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sparrow’s play</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>He quivers inside you, usually just before orgasm.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is harder than it sounds because it means him using his pelvic floor muscles to move his penis rather than using his hips.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The Jewel Case</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He gives an involuntary shudder inside you, such as he does on orgasm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No practise required for this one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Moving forwards or Natural</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>He gives a gentle stroke forwards, which may be varied in depth and speed.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sound familiar?

He then lies high up on your body (CAT - Coital Alignment Technique - disciples will be familiar with this one) and penetrates.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The angle of penetration is crucial here.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He’s not entering at right angles - the usual position - instead the penis is parallel to the vulva, so when he moves in and out, it pulls on and stimulates the clitoral area.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Love's Tailor </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>He inserts just the tip of his penis and makes several small in and out tiny thrusts (aka sporting the sparrow). Then suddenly, in a single stroke, he penetrates completely.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The idea, of course, is to accomplish several sets of these but don’t be surprised if you lose it at the first fence.<strong> </strong></p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox femail" data-version="2" id="mol-b5547680-26f3-11e8-89c2-7df667259b9d">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">More ways to make thrusting better</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="class"><strong>The first thrust is often the best. </strong></span><strong>Don’t waste it.

The absolute worst thing to do is for him to penetrate then immediately start jackhammering.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Keep your pelvises close. Keeping constant pressure on the clitoris is what you need to orgasm. Move in small circles with your hips pressed to his and rub your clitoris against his pelvic bone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>If he climaxes too quickly, doing this helps enormously because stimulation is low for him when he’s deep inside.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Try rocking. Penetrate then simply rock back and forth rhythmically. This works particularly well in sitting positions with you on his lap.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Deep thrusting helps. The deeper he penetrates, the more the movement tugs on the inner lips, in turn stimulating your clitoris.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Try some Tao thrusting.

This makes it sore and sensitive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The secret to beating the enzyme however is to soak a whole pineapple in salt water before you chop it up and start enjoying this tangy fruit.</p><img id="i-8bc232b7b99cbd5f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/08/11/49FF748700000578-5476901-image-a-27_1520507605152.jpg" height="634" width="634" alt="Most pineapples are grown in Costa Rica, Brazil, and the Philippines but the plant is indigenous to South America" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pineapples are the only food to contain bromelain, an enzyme that digests protein and breaks down amino acids.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When you eat the fruit, these enzymes also digest the protein of tissues on your tongue, namely a protective mucus that coats your mouth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the fruit removes this mucus, your tongue becomes much more sensitive and more easily irritated, which is why it starts to burn when you eat pineapple.</p><div>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">A few weeks after my twin boys, Zachary and Jonah, were born I strapped them into their buggy and rounded up their big brothers Jacob and Max, then aged five and three, for a walk in the park.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was so proud of my four beautiful sons that I felt as though my heart might burst. I finally had the perfect family.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But my happy bubble was popped by an elderly lady who peered into the buggy and asked: 'Two more boys?' When I said yes, she said: 'Never mind, better luck next time,' before shuffling off.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was deeply upset, although not that surprised. It was just further proof of something that has been clear since the day I had Jacob, now 14: how deeply our society is prejudiced against boys.</p><img id="i-636546b4b3ef78df" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/07/21/49FAF9FF00000578-5474193-image-a-21_1520459363542.jpg" height="532" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Things have come full circle from the days when a mother who produced a brood of strapping young men was showered with compliments. Now the news you have only sons is met with commiserations. There's an unthinking — and unkind — assumption boys are second best.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most assume I had the twins in an attempt to 'complete' my family with a girl. But I simply yearned for another baby. I'd always wanted boys, but either gender would have been fine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I feel for Coleen Rooney, who has just joined the club of mums with four sons. Like me, she'll soon be fending off rude questions about whether she's desperate to hit the pink jackpot by 'trying again' for a girl. Well, I hope Coleen joins me in shouting at every busybody who asks: 'Not that it's any of your business, but I am very happy with my boys.'</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I've lost count of the people — mostly women — who've refused to believe I could possibly love my sons as much as I would a daughter. But that's nonsense. Valentine's Day has just passed, and with it the latest reminder of why I love being the mother of four boys. My thoughtful husband bought me roses and champagne, but the card that truly touched my heart was made by my youngest son, nine-year-old Zachary.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Covered with dozens of purple felt-tip kisses, it listed all the reasons he loves me, ending by saying he could 'go on with much more, but there wouldn't be enough paper in the world'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You will never feel as adored as when you are a mum to boys. As soon as he learned to write, my eldest, Jacob, used to leave clues around the house leading to little notes or presents for me.</p><img id="i-27deb5d4514bce46" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/07/20/49FA6F2200000578-5474193-image-a-19_1520455370499.jpg" height="700" width="634" alt="Ursula claims her sons help with carrying shopping and compliment her (Ursula's sons pictured from left to right: Jonah, Jacob, Zachary and Max)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I still have one I found under my pillow when he was six, which reads: 'To Mummy, there is not a single thing that I love more than you. You blow my heart away. You are the best. From J.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If I get my hair or nails done, my husband will be oblivious, but without fail one of the boys will pipe up with a compliment. Every mealtime they fight over who gets to sit next to me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My eldest, who towers over me, insists on carrying my shopping. I come home from work to a gaggle of excited boys. We even bought a male dog, as I wasn't sure I wanted another girl in the house even if she was canine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Outside our home, though, the cult of the girl only grows. Even former football WAG Danielle Lloyd failed to provoke outrage when she admitted she was considering using gender selection to ensure her fifth child was a girl, after feeling disappointed her fourth was a boy. I wonder how that will make him feel when he's older? I am sick of being made to feel as if I won the booby prize because I have only boys. But I am even more tired of my sons being made to feel as if they are second-class citizens because they had the misfortune to be born male.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-1e6e5610-2247-11e8-892d-cf038fa074f9">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"><span class="femail-ccox">Mum I think your work is done, our teachers do nothing but encourage girls to get jobs in science now </span></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was recently working on a project to promote science and technology careers to girls. A laudable aim, but when I spoke to my son Jacob about it, he said: 'Mum I think your work is done, our teachers do nothing but encourage girls to get jobs in science now.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There's nothing wrong with that, but it overlooks the fact that when it comes to underperforming at school and in life, it's not girls we need to worry about. Boys are three times as likely to be excluded from school and consistently do worse than girls academically.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My middle son, Max, 12, is a beautiful singer, but he always felt uncomfortable as one of the few boys in his school choir. Boys were just not made welcome.</p><img id="i-d206cefc314db69b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/07/20/49FA6F1400000578-5474193-image-m-13_1520454860979.jpg" height="712" width="634" alt="Ursula (pictured) believes much of the education system is set up towards female strengths and their success" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile there are teams at school for girls to play sports like football and cricket — yet no dance troupes for boys.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So much of our education system is based around female strengths. Studies show that young children with good self-discipline — for example raising their hands to answer questions, listening and following instructions — do better at primary school.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These are traits that girls develop much faster than boys, setting them up for academic and career success.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's no better when they grow up — men report significantly lower life satisfaction than women and account for three-quarters of all suicides; it's the biggest cause of death for men under 45. Men are also more likely to end up homeless, drug or alcohol dependent. Is it any wonder, when we have such a low opinion of them?</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-544105d0-2247-11e8-892d-cf038fa074f9">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"><span class="femail-ccox">You'd better hope you get a nice daughter-in-law, because you don't have any daughters to look after you when you're old </span></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">A recent survey revealed women are twice as likely to want a daughter as a son. I assume they imagine a daughter will mean a life filled with pretty dresses, shopping trips and female bonding. Boys meanwhile are seen as noisy, dirty and violent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Well, not in my experience. Yes, when they were tiny they were full of limitless energy. While girls would play nicely for hours, my boys had to be taken for regular runs to let off steam. But that didn't make them less lovable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now they are becoming teenagers, the tables are turning. My sons' worst expression of puberty is they grunt more than they speak. Many friends with girls are being subjected to icy disdain mixed with the explosive rows typical of mother-daughter relationships during this hormonal time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I blush to recall how nasty I was at 13. I rowed with my mother about everything from cooking to clothes. I remember once threatening to jump out of my bedroom window if she didn't let me call my boyfriend. She was obviously distraught.</p><img id="i-49cbec9ab5245f6f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/07/20/49FA700F00000578-5474193-image-a-20_1520455636886.jpg" height="484" width="634" alt="Ursula revealed her sons (pictured) have been bullied and teased for not conforming to macho stereotypes" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">By contrast, the odd grump and monosyllabic exchanges I get from my older boys are a walk in the park. Perhaps women longing for girls should be careful what they wish for.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But none of this stops boys getting a bad press. Recently I was chatting to a girlfriend about how well a mutual friend had cared for her dying dad. She leaned over and stroked my arm, saying: 'You'd better hope you get a nice daughter-in-law, because you don't have any daughters to look after you when you're old.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was furious. Why did she assume my boys would desert me, but a daughter never would? I know plenty of men who care for their elderly parents, and women who never bother to call.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These days, girls are endlessly told they can be whatever they want to be. It isn't so easy for boys. My boys are sensitive, empathetic and not the slightest bit interested in football. But rather than being praised for not conforming to tired, macho stereotypes, they have been teased and bullied.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I wanted to sob when my eldest son caved in and gave up ballet after two years of all the girls — and their mothers — pointedly freezing out this male interloper in their world of pink tutus.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It broke my heart when Zachary's classmates teased him as he showed off the pink teddy bear in a sparkly dress he had made for his fifth birthday at Build-A-Bear Workshop. It was unbearable to hear Max tell me he spent every playtime alone because he didn't play football. It seems boys must still be boys.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That's why I believe it's about time us mums of boys stuck up for our sons. I'm sure that having girls is lovely, but I really, truly don't think my family would be improved by the addition of a daughter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I adore my four boys and I'm confident they will grow into strong, loving men who will take care of me in my dotage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For now, they fill my life with noise, Lego bricks, lost socks, silly jokes and boundless joy. So to everyone who asks whether I secretly want a girl, the answer is a resounding: 'No'.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Mother-of-four Ursula Hirschkorn (pictured left with her sons), claims boys are treated as second class citizens and as if they've had misfortune in being born male.

So I'm writing to tell you one last time to stop exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your 'nice girl' persona.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She linked her post to a 2017 newspaper story headlined: 'Inside the mean-girls culture that destroyed Sex And The City.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The language was such that one has to wonder if, even allowing for her obvious grief, Kim, 61, had rather taken leave of her senses.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clearly she felt blind fury that Sarah Jessica, 52 — known to all as SJP — was, in her view, yet again fostering her public image as a 'nice girl' offering support to her 'friend Kim' — and that muscling in on the Cattrall family's grief was a step too far. </p><img id="i-6eaf4c64de0df149" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/12/00/491CA7B200000578-5379301-image-a-18_1518395466190.jpg" height="496" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">No one who has followed the relationship between the women was under the illusion it was very good — they are both known to have diva-ish tendencies and have been feuding on and off for years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But until this weekend the depth of hostility involved, on Cattrall's part at least, was unknown. It would seem the huge resentment she appears to feel towards SJP — over her status on the show, her salary and her influence — boiled over in that one, vitriolic rant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So is SJP entirely innocent or does Kim have grounds for her anger?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Certainly there were times when the 'mean girls' atmosphere on Sex And The City reached such a pitch that neither Queen Bee SJP nor the other two stars, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis, would speak to Kim.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not a word — beyond what the scripts demanded — despite 15-hour days filming together, for months on end.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The three women would eat lunch apart from Kim, too, according to sources on set.</p><img id="i-4d9eddbfaa1a433b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/12/00/491CA7A600000578-5379301-image-m-19_1518395470257.jpg" height="419" width="634" alt="What it unleashed in return has shocked much of Hollywood and millions of Sex And The City (pictured) fans worldwide. Kim responded with a furious attack that seemed, if not irrational, then certainly out of proportion" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">When they were shooting out of town, they would stay in different hotels. There was no girly exchange of gossip while they were all having their make-up done. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The reasons were many; over the years arguments raged over everything from status and money to the amount of nudity in love scenes. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">SJP got to keep her bra on, which rankled with Kim who, as sexually voracious Samantha Jones, was required to bare all at every opportunity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But essentially, it all boiled down to which actress was the bigger star.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">SJP, nominally the star of the show as sex columnist Carrie Bradshaw — and incidentally best friends with series producer Michael Patrick King — fought hard against Cattrall's natural scene-stealing charisma.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">SJP got pay rises, promotion to executive editor and ever more say over the series, which ran between 1998-2004. Kim, however, did not — despite her furious protests.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Evidently matters became so unpleasant that Kim decided she was done with Sex And The City, and despite two successful spin-off films, she turned her back on a third.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That prompted some semi-public sniping in October last year after Kim appeared on a British chat show — but that was all. Which is what makes Kim's outbursts this weekend all the more jaw-dropping.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It has always been a contentious relationship — they were the two alpha dogs on set and it was uncomfortable from day one,' says a source close to the show.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'As time went on, SJP definitely looked down on Kim for her sexpot image and her third divorce.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Initially, SJP was the bigger star, having made her name in the hit movie Footloose in 1984 aged 18.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was fiercely ambitious, having grown up poor in Nelsonville, Ohio, and had such a high opinion of her film career that she needed some persuading to sign up for Sex And The City in 1998.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cattrall, by contrast — who was born in Liverpool but whose family emigrated to Canada when she was a baby — was a jobbing actress with appearances in Quincy, Star Trek, glossy drama Scruples and teen film Porky's being her highlights.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sex And The City, based on the book by Candace Bushnell, was a huge, era-defining success for the cable network HBO.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Within a few seasons, the four stars of the show were among the biggest names in television. And no one's name was bigger than SJP's.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She and Cynthia Nixon (Miranda) had known each other for years, and she quickly became fast friends with Kristin Davis (Charlotte), too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kim's only ally was Darren Starr, who had created the show and produced it. But after the second season he was replaced by Michael Patrick King, a close friend of SJP's.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By 2002, SJP had negotiated an 'executive producer' credit to reflect her importance and was reputedly being paid nearly three times as much as her co-stars — $1 million per episode compared with $350,000. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This caused mutterings because the great example at the time was Friends, which ran from 1994 to 2004 and was also globally successful.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All the Friends principals were paid exactly the same throughout its run — going from $75,000 an episode in series three to $1 million an episode by series ten.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kim Cattrall, whose third marriage to audio engineer Mark Levinson was falling apart due to the strains of filming, thought Sex And The City should follow Friends' lead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Former HBO CEO Chris Albrecht explained: 'Sarah was becoming more and more famous, and her salary increased beyond what was contractually committed, which is normal for hit shows. The other actresses wanted to keep up.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there was more to it than just the money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A source says: 'From the point when SJP had her executive producer credit, she took ownership of the show and this always grated on Kim.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Kim wanted an executive producer credit from series three but was never given one. She felt SJP got more screen time than she did, which was only fair because Sarah Jessica was the lead, but it caused tension.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Then she had to watch while SJP was given a say on the lines her character said, plot lines and so on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And SJP never had to show nudity, whereas Kim had to be naked the whole time.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The source adds that the clash of the egos made life on set awkward. 'SJP and the other girls . . . called each other and socialised and Kim was always the one left out.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then in 2002, a showbiz magazine claimed Kim had let slip that Cynthia Nixon had suffered a miscarriage and was planning another pregancy. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nixon was said to be stunned by the 'betrayal' and the repercussions rumbled on for a long time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A crew member reportedly said: 'Sarah, Kristin and Cynthia have frozen Kim out. They won't sit with her for meals, there's no going out after the show for a nightcap. It's so bad she basically sits in her dressing room alone — sometimes crying.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was around this time, while on location in Atlantic City, that SJP reportedly rented a house for herself, Kristin and Cynthia, leaving Kim on her own.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When this came to light, the series' maker HBO had to to play down talk of divisions — after all this was a show that was heavily sold as a joyous exploration of the sustaining power of female friendships.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to a spokesman, Kim stayed in a different house 'because she was married and her husband was supposed to come down'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is telling, however, that when the TV series ended in 2004, SJP reportedly broke down in tears while filming the last episode but Kim was rather more brusque. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If I miss them, I can just put on a DVD, like everyone else,' she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She later told chat show host Jonathan Ross that she had felt 'after six years it was time for all of us to participate in the financial windfall of Sex And The City. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When they didn't seem keen on that, I thought it was time to move on.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ironically, the chance to cash in came as soon as the last episode had been transmitted — as fans clamoured for a film.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Released in 2008 — the highest grossing romantic comedy of the year, taking $400 million worldwide — the movie had been preceded by a long delay due to salary negotiations: more specifically to Kim Cattrall saying 'No'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Later, she said she was going through a divorce and caring for her sick father, and simply felt too exhausted to contemplate a return.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whatever the truth, the result of the negotiations was that SJP was paid more than £10 million, Kim Cattrall around £5 million and Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis around £2 million each.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Great efforts were made all round to foster solidarity, and in December 2009 Cattrall turned up to support SJP on the red carpet premiere of her film Did You Hear About The Morgans?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">SJP told Elle magazine that she 'adored' Kim Cattrall, and said: 'I wouldn't have done the movie without her.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sadly, it seems that this may have been the high water mark in their association, because the making of Sex And The City 2 broke the peace between them once and for all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">SJP admitted filming had led to conflicts. 'You're on set, you're working 90-hour weeks, you're never home, you're exhausted,' she said. 'Sometimes feelings get hurt. But I don't have any regrets about how I've treated people.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One flashpoint this time around was the confidentiality agreement the film company made everyone sign. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Under its terms, anyone proved to be the leak of the story about the movie was liable to pay up to $2.5 million in damages.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kim Cattrall nearly came a cropper after she was photographed holding a script with some of the dialogue visible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bosses issued a warning telling her to be more careful. 'I thought: 'You have got to be kidding!' she said later. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This isn't state secrets, it's the f***ing script for a movie!' Warring egos also made themselves felt on the second film. Even Chris Noth, who played Carrie's enduring love Mr Big, joined in. He felt the biggest ego on set belonged to Cattrall.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'All actresses have someone working for them called a 'vanity person', he said. 'Their job is to make sure you look good at all times during filming.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Most actors only have one person doing this job. But on Sex And The City, all of the stars had two. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Except Kim, who had three.' During the making of the film on location in Morocco, Cattrall stayed at the Royal Mansour hotel, while the other three were living at La Mamounia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was no let up in tension after the film was released to widespread criticism.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The script was deemed to be too heavy on puns and SJP's fondness for this type of joke was blamed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Outwardly there were denials, of course, that relations had descended again into the deep freeze. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, Cattrall told this newspaper in 2010: 'I think Sarah is fantastic. She is a born leader and she guides the crew and cast in such a strong but gentle way.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But clearly, she was sick of deferring to the 'born leader', whatever the financial rewards, because negotiations to bring Cattrall back into the fold for a third movie came to naught.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A script was written in 2013 and negotiations opened in 2016. But last year it was reported that Cattrall had 'killed' the film with 'outrageous demands', refusing to be in it unless Warner Bros agreed to produce other films which she had in development.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This she denied, saying: 'The only demand I ever made was that I didn't want to do a third film . . . and that was back in 2016.' SJP confirmed rather more diplomatically: 'It's over. We're not doing it. I'm disappointed.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The implication was that she was not to blame. However, Cattrall was having none of it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a TV interview with Piers Morgan, she explained: 'The common ground we had was the series and the series is over. For me it's over; it's over with no regrets. I just wish that Sarah had been nicer.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And that, of course, is the theme she returned to this weekend in her furious social media post.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are few in Hollywood who would bet on a rapprochment any time soon.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>To the uninformed observer, it was a compassionate message of warmth and support for an old friend at a dreadful time of loss. The post from actress Sarah Jessica Parker (pictured left) on social media read: 'Dearest Kim (Cattrall, right), my love and condolences to you and yours and Godspeed to your beloved brother. Xx' She was responding to the announcement by Kim Cattrall, her former Sex And The City (inset) co-star, that Kim's brother, Chris, 55, had been found dead on his farm in Canada. What it unleashed in return has shocked much of Hollywood and millions of Sex And The City fans worldwide.

I was in solitary. I would look out the window and look for the moon. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Sometimes I saw it, many times I didn’t. When I saw it, it gave me hope and comfort.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That’s why he called his baby daughter Lua, Portuguese for ‘moon’. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her second name is Izzy in honour of his grandfather who changed his name to Kirk Douglas from Issur Danielovitch when he started his Hollywood career in the 1940s.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cameron says he stayed sane inside jail by focusing on books, devouring the classics: ‘Dickens, Oscar Wilde, everything by Hemingway.’</p><img id="i-455e4a4b9df66d14" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/10/20/03B790DE00000514-5376425-image-m-34_1518294890392.jpg" height="902" width="634" alt="He added: 'She never gives up on anything and she didn’t quit on me. The love of my family got me through my darkest days'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also volunteered for intensive anti-addiction counselling. ‘I’ve wasted enough time in life to addiction. Every day in jail I woke up thinking, “What can I do today to prepare for when I finally get out?” </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I knew this was my last chance. I could get sober or wind up dead.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prison life was brutal. Take for example the time he broke his leg and finger during a game of handball. ‘The bone was sticking out of my leg,’ he recalls.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The nurse put a brace on it, gave me some ibuprofen and sent me back to my cell.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Five days later, his cellmate called the warden and, with his leg swollen to twice its normal size, he was moved to a civilian hospital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I had a massive blood clot in my leg which could have killed me had I not got treatment,’ he calmly explains.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For all that, Cameron, who is now writing a book about his experiences, credits jail with ‘making me a man’. He was released in August 2016 and spent nine months in a Manhattan halfway house.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At first it was tough, he explains, recalling how he went through waves of euphoria mixed with panic. Then he threw himself into the family ‘business’ – acting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cameron had already appeared in six films, including 2003’s It Runs In The Family and is now attending auditions, describing himself as ‘determined’ to land a role.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It’s my passion.

His ambitions, he says are more modest. ‘I just want to work. When I got out of jail, no agent or manager would touch me because of my reputation.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Baby Lua was born shortly before Christmas. He and the baby’s mother Viviane knew each other before he was incarcerated but ‘bonded the old-fashioned way through letters’ while he was inside. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She is Michael and Catherine’s first grandchild. ‘Catherine says she wants to be called ZeeZee and dad wants to be ‘Baba’ for some reason,’ Cameron grins.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says he now appreciates every day of freedom, even though he is still on parole and needed a judge’s permission to move from New York to LA to pursue his acting dream.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Life stops in prison.

For most of his adult life he (pictured inset) has been branded the 'black sheep' of the Douglas clan, a man who made lurid headlines for constant drug arrests and trips to rehab. Yet today, Cameron is bursting with health and happiness. Clean and sober, he has a new baby daughter Lua Izzy with his Brazilian girlfriend Viviane Thibes (pictured together right), who stood by him through his incarceration in a romance that grew stronger through writing letters. After the mistakes he made with Cameron, Michael vowed to do things differently during his 17-year marriage to Zeta-Jones (pictured centre with Cameron).</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Phoebe Southworth</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-02-14T10:14:08.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Michael Douglas's son comes clean about drugs, prison and his stepmum</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-02-14T10:14:08.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5287299/Michael-Douglas-accused-masturbating-of.html" title="'He was rubbing himself and then his voice cracked': Former assistant says Michael Douglas pleasured himself in a meeting, harassed her with sex talk and boasted about affair with Kathleen Turner"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5288547/Michael-Douglas-accuser-speaks-TV-interview.html" title="'He thought he was the king of the world': Former employee of Michael Douglas claims he 'masturbated in front of her' and 'belittled her looks' when she worked for him in the 80s"></link></item><item><title>Obese woman left wheelchair-bound when a gastric balloon FAILED to stop her over-eating reveals she's finally turned her life around after losing 235lbs with the help of more surgery </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5366521/My-600lbs-Life-Wheelchair-bound-woman-turns-life-around.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2018 10:42:26 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5366521</guid><description><![CDATA[Karina Garcia, 38, from Texas, who weighed 633lbs at her heaviest, shed 235lbs and swapped her wheelchair for a walker with the help of Dr Nowzaradan, on the US reality show My 600lb Life.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The Queen, now 91, is Britain's longest-serving monarch, the world's oldest head of state and approaching the 65th anniversary of her coronation. It is a life that started in the Jazz Age and has stretched far into the digital one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is hard for some of us to remember that she was not always this august. 'I suppose people may now see a 91-year-old lady and forget she was once young,' recalls Prudence, Lady Penn, one of the Queen's oldest friends, who herself is 91. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I remember going with her and Prince Philip to a nightclub in Leicester Square called The 400, which was the smart place to go. And we had drinks, and something to eat and we danced. She loved to do normal things like you do when you are young.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Crown, the dramatisation of the Queen's life on <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sciencetech/netflix/index.html" id="mol-3c353290-09b5-11e8-a1d8-ad39ff856ea6">Netflix</a>, has introduced a new generation to the young Elizabeth. But the series has played fast and loose with the truth. Many are keen to set the record straight, not least her close friends. This explains why Lady Penn, a former lady-in-waiting to the Queen Mother, along with more of the Queen's oldest companions have given in-depth interviews for Elizabeth: Our Queen, an eight-part documentary starting this week on Channel 5.</p><img id="i-81d3e3e44d624f73" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/31/15/48BBAF4C00000578-5329995-Elizabeth_pictured_in_her_Girl_Guide_uniform_in_1942_has_been_dr-a-23_1517413094888.jpg" height="1012" width="962" alt="Elizabeth (pictured in her Girl Guide uniform in 1942) has been dramatized for Netflix series The Crown, and now her oldest friends have started to set the records straight" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most are usually wary of talking publicly about their friendship, but they have shared their memories of the Queen and her husband, some stretching back to the 1930s, as well as their memories of Princess Margaret, who also features a lot in The Crown. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You are not getting the fictionalised conversations, you are getting the eye-witness accounts,' explains Charles Colville, the series producer. 'A lot of the interviewees are in their 80s and 90s, it is extraordinary to get them. I don't want to sound pompous, but you felt that you were recording history.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some of the interviewees played a key part in the coronation. The day, in June 1953, was a splash of colour in austerity-hit Britain and also one full of ancient pageantry. That included the Queen having six maids of honour, in charge of holding her train and chosen for their good looks and aristocratic connections. All were daughters of dukes, marquesses or earls. They included the now Lady Anne Glenconner and Lady Jane Rayne-Lacey. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Four of us went to the Abbey to receive her,' remembers Lady Anne. The other two helped the Queen on her journey from Buckingham Palace. 'We were standing by the door and we could tell she was coming because we could hear this roar, which got louder and louder. And around the corner came this golden coach, which was like some fairy tale. Then the Queen! She looked fantastic. In this beautiful dress, with a tiny waist and a wonderful complexion. She looked dazzling. She just turned around and said, 'Ready girls?' and off we went.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The event was televised and watched by more than 20 million of the then 50 million who lived in Britain, an astonishing statistic, considering how many households could not yet afford the luxury of a television set in 1953.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lady Penn remembers the Queen's anxieties about it being broadcast. 'Television was very new. And I think it worried people that it was going to be an intrusion on a very sacred and solemn moment in her life.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a compromise, it was agreed that the most sacred part of the service would not be televised: when the Queen was anointed with holy oil by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Her maids of honour, however, were close witnesses to this intimate part, able to see when the Queen took off her robes and put on a simple shift dress. 'It brought a lump to my throat,' says Lady Jane. 'She looked very young, younger than 26, which is what she was. She looked so vulnerable and defenceless in a way just sitting there.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'd never seen her look like that before; she'd always been very dressed up. Here she was with nothing.'</p><img id="i-be5946fe3820fe46" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/31/15/48BBAF4400000578-5329995-Lady_Anne_Glenconner_pictured_left_with_Philip_was_one_of_six_ma-a-24_1517413094906.jpg" height="745" width="962" alt="Lady Anne Glenconner (pictured left with Philip) was one of six maids of honour at Queen Elizabeth's coronation " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Queen's unwillingness to let this moment be filmed is proof of how seriously she took the religious aspect of her coronation. 'The Queen's faith is incredibly important,' explains Colville. 'It is much deeper and more profound than most of us think. The spiritual element to the coronation was incredibly important for her.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her Christianity and being head of the Church of England made the Queen's decision about whether Princess Margaret could marry a divorcé so difficult. Margaret had fallen in love with Group Captain Peter Townsend, a war hero and equerry to King George VI in the late 1940s.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lady Jane had stayed at Balmoral for a week in 1950 and seen them together in the early stages, when Townsend was still married. 'I thought they were in love. And after seven days, I was convinced of it. When I went back to London I said to my mother, 'I think Princess Margaret and Peter Townsend are in love.' And Mother said, 'Don't be so romantic and ridiculous. He's the king's servant. She can't be in love with the king's servant, that would be utterly wrong.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Within three years, he was divorced, and Margaret was desperate to marry but, as she was under 25, needed the permission of the monarch. 'He was divorced. In those days, divorced people weren't allowed to come to Ascot,' says Lady Anne. 'It was difficult for the Queen to know how to respond.'</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-3c322550-09b5-11e8-a1d8-ad39ff856ea6">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"><span class="femail-ccox">Philip poured himself a stiff drink, he was shaken</span></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lady Penn insists the Queen would have allowed them to marry if Margaret was truly prepared to renounce her claim to the throne, as would have been demanded. 'I think the Queen would have been happy as long as Princess Margaret was happy. I don't think she had any strong feelings that he'd been divorced. But he was a lot older than her.' Sixteen years older, in fact.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To buy time and test Margaret's resolve Townsend was sent off to Brussels as an air attaché at the British Embassy for two years. When he returned Margaret was old enough to marry without permission. Townsend stayed with the Penns on his return, while he waited for Margaret to make up her mind. 'It had been such a rocky road, I think it had killed something,' says Lady Penn. Margaret announced that 'conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before others', and refused to marry Townsend.</p><img id="i-5a6e457f73627273" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/31/15/48BBAF4800000578-5329995-Lady_Anne_recalls_Margaret_pictured_left_with_family_friend_Lady-a-22_1517413094863.jpg" height="1009" width="962" alt="Lady Anne recalls Margaret (pictured left) was always thinking of naughty things to do" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Townsend episode, for the Queen, was an uncomfortable echo of the abdication crisis of 1936, which had thrust her father onto the throne. It cast a shadow over the Queen's childhood. That shadow is remembered by one of her oldest friends still alive: Myra, Lady Butter, 92, granddaughter of Grand Duke Michael of Russia and cousin of the Duke of Edinburgh. Lady Butter was in the 1st Buckingham Palace Company of Girl Guides with the Queen, when it launched in 1937. The Queen was in the Kingfisher patrol, Lady Butter in Robin. 'She was her patrol leader. It was great fun. We learnt how to do Morse code and tie knots.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She can well remember listening to Edward VIII's abdication broadcast on the wireless. 'I thought it was the end of the world. We haven't got a king, what's going to happen now?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her friends recall that, always a shy girl, the Queen became serious. Lady Anne says, 'Margaret was such fun, she was always thinking of naughty things to do. We used to hide behind doors [at Buckingham Palace] and when some wretched page came along, we'd jump out and the Queen would say, 'You can't do that. It's very naughty.'</p><img id="i-4b1a2a534ca83f84" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/31/15/48BBAF5800000578-5329995-Close_friend_Lady_Jane_pictured_at_the_rehearsal_for_the_Queen_s-a-26_1517413197314.jpg" height="611" width="470" alt="Close friend Lady Jane (pictured) at the rehearsal for the Queen's coronation" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The one time Princess Elizabeth did not toe the line was in choosing a husband. Her parents organised balls during the war at Windsor Castle, where many Grenadier Guards were stationed. 'It took you out of the horror of the war,' recalls Lady Butter. The hope was that the princess might find a match among the aristocratic British officers. But she'd set her heart on Philip, Prince of Greece and Denmark, a dashing naval officer who was almost penniless and homeless, his family scattered across Europe. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was seen as unsuitable by courtiers and her parents, says Lady Butter. 'He was outspoken, they would call him brash.' But Princess Elizabeth married her man in 1947. Lady Butter remembers being at the wedding. 'Lucky her, we thought, and lucky all of us. Because it was a really good fairy tale, and it remains a really good fairy tale.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The marriage has proved enduring, but there were early tensions. Philip had to give up his promising naval career to act as her consort. Later, the Cabinet decreed his children were to take the Windsor name, not Mountbatten, the name from his mother's family which Philip had adopted on marriage. His friends say that his feelings of frustration and emasculation were genuine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The royal couple struck a deal. The Queen, as sovereign would be in charge in public, but behind closed doors, with decisions about the family, Philip was in command. This deal included Philip deciding on a school for Prince Charles – Gordonstoun, not Eton as the Queen preferred. Philip believed the boarding school in an isolated part of Scotland would instil character into Charles. But though he was adamant about the importance of a tough education, Philip was not heartless, according to Lady Butter, who was staying with Philip when he first dropped Charles off at Gordonstoun in 1962. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'All I can remember is that when Prince Philip came back from taking Prince Charles to school, he looked slightly shaken. He didn't say anything, but he went straight over and poured himself a stiff drink – I do remember that. And I thought, 'Oh, that has shaken you.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Amid all the dramas and glories, the Queen has been surrounded by a close circle of friends, who saw her flourish. 'When the Queen was very young, the Queen Mother would tell her to be brave,' says Lady Penn. 'Her mother said to her, 'When you walk into a room, walk through the middle of the door.' She meant, don't go in apologetically, walk like you're in charge. That was very good advice.' And it's advice she's certainly followed to this day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Elizabeth: Our Queen begins on Tuesday at 9pm on Channel 5.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Queen Elizabeth's (pictured left in 1942) oldest friends are hoping to set records straight in a new eight-part Channel 5 documentary.

We married and believe we are soulmates, have three children together and have had a wonderful life for 14 years.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>However, we moved house six months ago, and while unpacking old boxes I saw a picture of her with one of the guys she kissed.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>She says that after that experience she was done with other boys and has always been faithful to me.

I've also just learnt two things I didn't know about.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here's the first: 'Mind-Body Bridging [MBB] is a mindfulness-based technique developed by Stanley H. Block, MD, to improve mindful awareness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'In contrast to Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, MBB does not include meditation exercises. Instead, it cultivates awareness skills to heighten recognition of various aspects of a dysfunctional mind-body state — for example, ruminating thoughts . . . and impaired mental or physical functioning — and offers mind-body mapping exercises to further raise awareness of the sources of the disharmony.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Er, ok. And EMDR is, indeed, yet another form of psycho- therapy which uses eye movements, relaxations and sounds to help heal acute psychological difficulties arising from trauma as well as 'prolonged, low-grade distress that originates in shock or loss in adult life and/or issues experienced during childhood'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Reading about it I reflect that the techniques seem to go over memories in an obsessive way that could make them worse. But I'm not an expert and am prepared to be shot down by those who are — even if they have few qualifications.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Look, I know I sound cynical, but I don't mean to be. It's just that I feel bewildered because the world is full of therapies with competing methods of healing, so that those who want help (and maybe search on the British Association for Counselling &amp; Psychotherapy's directory itsgoodtotalk.org.uk/therapists) might be left utterly confused.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the site I mention, there are 30 therapies to choose from — so how do you know what you need? Might you start a course of EMDR, for example, and find it wrong for you?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You ask for my thoughts, so here goes. The wonderful wife you adore, the mother of your three children, made a mistake more than 14 years ago — and I wish with all my heart she'd kept quiet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Obviously you blanked it out, went ahead with the marriage, and now (because of that photograph) you are finally allowing yourself to brood. Where is the mystery here? Where is the 'trauma' that needs so much therapy?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just imagine what it would be like were something terrible to happen to one of your children (see today's second letter), and ask yourself if that might deserve the name of 'trauma'. A young woman getting drunk and having sex once . . .? No, I'm sorry. It doesn't register with me as a sin or crime — nor would it with the men I know.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nobody is ever 'safe' in this world. Not if we open ourselves as mature people to the various setbacks life will throw, which we can never predict.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We will suffer rejections, family quarrels, disappointment, ageing, ill health and the deaths of those we love. In order to cope, we must cultivate strength of mind and resilience of spirit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tell yourself your heart is not 'broken', it's a tad bruised, that's all. I think you should give therapy a rest, take some deep breaths, watch the news, and give thanks for the life you have.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong> I'm so hurt by my sister's snub</strong>  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Dear Bel,</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>I have two sisters, one of whom I’ve seen regularly over the years. The other sister never wanted to meet because she was living her life around her son.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Invitations I sent her to meet were rebuffed countless times so I chose to forget about her.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>However, her son was killed at the age of 30 in a hit-and-run accident last October, and at that time I chose to forgive her and we’ve all met a few times.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>I live 40 minutes away from my sister’s, but the other day they all met along with her daughter, and since then I’ve been so upset and hurt that I wasn’t invited to join them.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>If I didn’t love my sisters so much, especially the one whose son was killed, I don’t think I’d care. How can I stop thinking about this and how do I stop feeling so jealous, hurt and upset?</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>LORNA </strong></p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just lately, many problems seem about the family, rather than romantic relationships or marriage, and I'm wondering why.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It could be post-Christmas, of course, because that time of year arouses so many expectations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But your problem goes so much deeper, and I wish I knew more. (Used as I am to long emails, with your terse one I had to insert words to make it read easily.)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I'm not entirely clear which of your two sisters lives 40 minutes away and which one has the daughter, but no matter — we'll plough on and try to reach the heart of the matter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You tell a short, bleak tale in which you believe you are the injured party. Yet can I suggest that perhaps your relationship with 'other sister' was never good?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You say she 'rebuffed' you, and yet I have to assume she was seeing the third sister during that time. (It's confusing so I'll use OS for 'other sister' and TS for the third one.) So I suspect you and OS fell out at some stage and the issue was never resolved and that's where it all starts. When you say you love both sisters 'so much' and pick out OS 'especially' — I'm afraid it just doesn't ring true.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Something is wrong here — and an inability to face up to the truth is often at the root of family problems. You clearly think that you have always been in the right, because it's impossible not to notice the way you express yourself (no words added here): 'I chose to forget about her' and 'I chose to forgive her.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps she did hurt you with her constant refusals — yet you did not 'forget' her, so why pretend? You went on resenting her. As for 'choosing' to forgive somebody you allegedly love when the son who was the pivot of her life has met a sudden, horrible death . . . Well! I ask you to look carefully at your own words and consider the meaning they carry for other people.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Have you got it? Yes, you sound totally self-absorbed. This is not about you. I can see why you felt left out when you heard that OS and TS had met together with your niece, but surely you can see they are entitled to continue with a relationship that went on for years without you in it?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Honestly, you have to understand that blunt truth if you are to have any chance of moving on, salving your own wounded feelings and establishing a good relationship with both your sisters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It seems to me you must start by placing the bereavement at centre stage. Moving yourself far to one side, remind yourself you are only one player in this tragedy — and not an important one at that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead of thinking about how left out you feel, focus hard on that young life cut short and think how his mother must have felt — and is still feeling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She is the tragic figure who is now having to face the rest of her life without her son. She is the one who has been 'upset and hurt' beyond words.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All you can do is open your whole heart to that fact, forget about yourself, and let her know that you will always want to see her and listen to her talk about her beloved son, your nephew. Then wait.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>And finally, the key to beating loneliness</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I'm impressed by the matter-of-fact sense in a letter from Mr S (from Leicestershire) and want to share it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having read my recent article on loneliness, he observes: 'One can empathise with those living with little social interaction . . . But many people self-handicap and make the bad decision of not pursuing independent interests while enjoying the comfort zone of a relationship.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He makes the point that too many women live 'defined by the relationship': 'They have achieved their aim of finding Mr Right and . . . they jettison hobbies and immerse themselves in the relationship.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says men, too, make the same mistake. Is that right? Yes, I think it often is — in the sense that people can become too inter-dependent and neglect the rest of life. Meanwhile, those who fail to find 'the one' feel they've missed out and become lonely, depressed and (as Mr S puts it) 'introspective — in self-imposed isolation'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I find this reader's email refreshingly blunt: 'I play golf and observe how many 'senior' men are on the course at the crack of dawn', because they are seemingly glad to escape demanding wives who 'are watching the clock, unable to exploit their own freedom and pursue independent interests . . . Then, when divorce or death happen, such people are incapable of coping — perceiving inevitable moments of solitude and silence as a curse.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's a good point. Somehow I suspect Mr S lives alone and, like him, I believe it is important to cultivate an inner life that can enable you to be contented in your own company.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He gives his own prescription: 'My simple solution: join the groups you should have joined when you were married; always have excellent Radio 4 on and focus your thoughts on what you listen to; read books and newspapers . . . thus avoiding the destructive introspection that leads to feeling I'm fed up; I'm alone; I've got no friends.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don't you think there's some wisdom here?</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>My wife and I met at 17.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Equally season 7 implies that Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) is the youngest of the group as she is last to turn 30.

she grew up with, including Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, fans may notice that this is inconsistent with a later storylines which sees Chandler and Rachel attending Geller Thanksgivings on several occasions, and in an episode from season 10 the pair are seen kissing in a flashback to Chandler's college years.</p><p

Ross and Joey have all voiced their appreciation of the movie Die Hard in various episodes of the sitcom.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It therefore seems an unusual choice of the producers to select the film's lead actor Bruce Willis to star as Rachel's lover Paul Stevens in season 6.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">None of the three central male characters acknowledge the resemblance

Dawn recalls as a child being exposed to images of naked women nailed to crucifixes, and 'Hookers for Jesus' captioned posters, produced by the Children of God.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The cult was widely reported to have brainwashed its members into believing that being part of sex acts – even if they were at a young age and didn’t understand what they were doing - was all part of God’s expression of love. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The bizarre act of 'flirty fishing' </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dawn said: 'I never had any father figure growing up in the community.

'So worse case scenario, if [the derma roller] ruined my skin, I already wasn’t happy with it... So could only really improve.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Still, she didn't do too much research about derma rolling before starting the treatment, and simply bought the one she did because 'it had some good reviews' — and was surprised by the remarkable difference it made.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She used the <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.regardingskin.com.au/product/re-face-body-derma-roller-all-in-one-micro-needle-treatment/">Re Cosmetics Face &amp; Body Derma Roller All in One  Micro Needle Treatment</a>, which is available for $129 on the company's website. She said she bought one on eBay for $65 AUD.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Containing hundreds of tiny needles, a derma roller is a handheld tool used to create micro-injuries on the surface of the skin. These punctures are believed to promote collagen and elastin production and help the skin repair. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Needles can vary in length and the right one to use depends on the thickness of the skin — with fleshier, thicker parts requiring longer needles and shorter needles only suitable for more delicate areas of the face.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As her stretch marks were 'really quite bad, very deep,' she used the longest needle attachment, which measured 1.5 millimeters, on her thighs.</p><div>

'You definitely have to inflict pain unfortunately.'</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS femail" data-version="2" id="mol-61b39580-ebfa-11e7-9090-5d1d3dcdfe0a">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">WHAT ARE STRETCH MARKS? </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">She also shared that afterwards, she applied the serum again, but said she 'was definitely lazy' in applying the serum every day. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The first session I didn’t press hard at all and the results weren’t amazing. I remembered reading it was going to hurt and it didn’t hurt so I figured I had to press harder (makes sense). So the next time I pushed hard enough that it hurt and got a little irritated but never bled,' she added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After just two sessions, the change in her skin's appearance was very noticeable. The woman also shared that she sped up the process by rolling for longer then the recommended time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You’re supposed to roll it five or so times in four directions so could literally take 30 or so seconds,' she said. 'I generally went a bit longer though.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She added that she didn't space out her sessions, either, waiting just two weeks between her first and second attempts instead of a couple of months as was recommended.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When asked if she was worried about damaging her skin, she replied that she was happy to experiment on her thighs as she never shows that area of skin anyway. She also didn't actually expect it to work, which is why she only bothered to try it out on a single thigh.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She added that because derma rolling allows the skin to absorb lotions and serums better, she believed it would help promote skin repair, which was her main goal.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>A 22-year-old woman has revealed how a $129 derma roller kit that bought off eBay has transformed the appearance of stretch marks on her thighs. In a picture posted to Reddit, one thigh appears blemish-free while the other is covered in stretch marks.

They cheered and applauded, and an apprentice presented the royal visitor with a bouquet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The generous Ulster folk saw what they took to be King George VI’s unworldly younger daughter, a novice princess learning on the job. They took to her instantly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Long before Kate and Diana, Princess Margaret was the royal pin-up, a hugely popular and glamorous figure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Reports of her visit to the Province described women and children fainting with excitement at seeing her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But were the crowds seeing the real Princess? For away from the public excitement and cameras, a very different figure was emerging: a wilful young woman who, it seems, had a lover almost twice her age.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The story of the Princess’s passionate, but ultimately doomed, affair with her father’s equerry, Battle of Britain flying ace Group Captain Peter Townsend — a married man with children — is one of the best-known episodes of the Queen’s reign, and has been fertile ground for the Netflix series The Crown.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is a story that has been repeated in such minute detail that one could hardly expect anything new of significance to emerge now, some 60 years later.</p><img id="i-e07eea08c921f1e9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/27/22/47990DC800000578-0-image-m-16_1514413277106.jpg" height="553" width="634" alt="The story of the Princess’s passionate, but ultimately doomed, affair with her father’s equerry, is one of the best-known episodes of the Queen’s reign, and has been fertile ground for the Netflix series The Crown" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Were it not for a new biography about Margaret — Ma’am Darling: 99 Glimpses Of Princess Margaret, written by Daily Mail columnist Craig Brown — the story would seem to have reached a natural conclusion, especially with both Princess and lover being dead, he in 1995, she seven years later.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But last week, Brown used his Mail column to reveal that someone who had read his book has unearthed fresh information which some might view as startling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What it suggests is that the love affair began years earlier than is popularly accepted. Indeed, it seems that when the Princess launched the Union-Castle liner on October 16, 1947, she was already in a relationship with Townsend, who was then 32 and the father of two young sons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We must stress that there is no proof they were intimate at that stage. But what we do now know is that for the visit to the shipyard, on which Townsend accompanied her, a request was made for them to have adjoining bedrooms at Hillsborough Castle, the then governor’s official residence in Belfast. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">They also posed for a photograph with the Governor of Northern Ireland, the late 4th Earl Granville.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was at a book-signing session that a figure approached Brown with the information. He had found notes among official papers of the visit recording that the Group Captain had asked for a different bedroom to the one he had been allocated. He asked to be moved next door to Margaret.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This, remember, was 70 years ago. Even today the idea of a married man in his 30s asking to be in such close proximity to a girl of 17 would raise eyebrows.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anyone who knew the diffident Townsend and the headstrong Margaret would assume the move was because she wanted it. As Brown’s book makes clear, what Margaret wanted, she usually got.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Earlier in 1947, Margaret and her sister, Elizabeth, had accompanied the King and Queen on a three-month State tour of Southern Africa. Townsend’s role was to chaperone the younger Princess. Reports of the tour judged the 5ft 1in Margaret to be ‘livelier, prettier, more sexually charged’ than her elder sister. Yet she was then still only 16.</p><img id="i-9f5d7397f32500fe" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/27/22/00884C8B00000190-0-Princess_Margaret_drives_from_Allanbay_House_Binfield_Berkshire_-m-19_1514413414951.jpg" height="405" width="306" alt="Princess Margaret, drives from Allanbay House, Binfield, Berkshire, where she and Group Captain Peter Townsend were the weekend guests of Mrs. John Lycett Wills in 1955" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">You would expect a teenage princess to be bored being toted from country to country with all the pomp and ceremony involved in State visits. But in future years Margaret would speak of remembering ‘every minute’ of the tour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The two were in each other’s company every day, riding out and taking in the sights. As Princess Margaret herself later told a confidante: ‘We rode together every morning in that wonderful country, in marvellous weather. That’s when I really fell in love with him.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, as is known, she was only 14 when Townsend arrived as Equerry and Deputy Master of the King’s Household, and immediately had a crush on him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With his quick wit and boyish charm, Townsend rapidly became a popular member of the King’s staff. He rode with the princesses, flew planes in air races for them, played canasta with the Queen and enlivened gatherings at the royal residences.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was, moreover, a married man who lived with his wife and children in a grace-and-favour cottage in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The then Queen and her daughters were frequent visitors to the Townsend family home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was to be six years after that Belfast visit before his affair with the King’s daughter became public, thanks to a famous moment during the Queen’s Coronation on June 2, 1953, when Margaret was seen tenderly removing a bit of fluff from his lapel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As everyone knows, two years of royal turmoil followed, during which Townsend and his wife Rosemary divorced, and he and the Princess wanted to marry.</p><img id="i-d602b48e6a762d67" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/27/23/4799686900000578-5216399-image-a-23_1514418805648.jpg" height="455" width="634" alt="Princess Margaret with RAF officer Group Captain Peter Townsend, left, in South Africa during the royal tour, 1947" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The climax came on October 31, 1955, when Margaret announced that, ‘mindful of the Church’s teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before any others,’ she would not marry the divorcee.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What remained unsaid was that marrying Townsend would have meant Margaret sacrificing her royal status, its privileges and perks. And Townsend could scarcely keep her in the manner to which she had been accustomed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For his part, Townsend later claimed to have not developed romantic feelings for the Princess until 1951, by which time she was 21 and he was safely divorced.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was all very convenient, except for one person — Rosemary Townsend. A brigadier’s daughter, she took an old-fashioned view and protected the Royal Family from scandal by declining to divorce Townsend and name the princess as the other woman.</p><img id="i-9ec2c41bc4e5a29f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/27/22/0087E92F00000190-5216399-Princess_Margaret_right_watches_the_finish_of_the_Queen_Anne_sta-m-21_1514413618903.jpg" height="533" width="634" alt="Princess Margaret (right) watches the finish of the Queen Anne stakes at Ascot Racecourse with her friend, Sharman Douglas - daughter of Leavis W. Douglas, US Ambassador to Britain. Left is group Capt Peter Townsend.

She and her second husband, banker John de Laszlo, had two children, before they, too, divorced. She then married the 5th Marquess Camden and had five happy years before he died in 1983.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Townsend’s sons were uncomfortably aware their mother took the blame to protect the Royal Family’s honour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From Hugo, a psychotherapist who lives in London, there was virtually silence, his only comment on the death of Margaret that ‘we are all sad for the Royal Family that the Princess has died’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Giles died two years ago still angry that ‘my mother took all the blame’. In conversation with us over the years, he never stepped back from that position: ‘She was hurt very much. Everyone knew my father was seeing the Princess. The divorce action could just as easily have gone the other way.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for Belfast and the launch of the liner, imagine how the news of the adjoining bedrooms of Princess Margaret and Peter Townsend would have gone down just a month before she was a bridesmaid at her sister’s wedding.</p><img id="i-b28db18e3bc9e64a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/27/23/4799686500000578-5216399-image-a-24_1514418834149.jpg" height="524" width="634" alt="Princess Margaret and Group Captain Peter Townsend, leaving Windsor Castle, April 12 1952" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">As an old friend of Margaret says: ‘This was playing with fire, a terrible risk for her reputation and that of the Royal Family. It’s a miracle it hasn’t come out before. I have to say, though, that having met Peter Townsend, I would be surprised if he was sleeping with the Princess when she was so young.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Margaret and Townsend met again 37 years after their split, he was happily married to Belgian Marie-Luce Jamagne (with whom he lived in France and had a daughter) and they could talk with the same intimacy as they had before.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was 1992 and he was in London to attend a reunion of those who had travelled with the Royal Family in 1947. To avoid Press attention, Margaret declined an invitation to the reunion, but invited Townsend to tea.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Three years later he was dead, but Margaret still had his letters, which she decreed could not be read until 100 years from her birth — in 2030.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But for these new details, nothing has ever emerged about when their affair — which plunged the royals into its greatest crisis since the Abdication — actually began. We may have to wait 13 years for that deadline to expire to learn the unvarnished truth. </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Princess Margaret launched her first ship in Belfast on October 16, 1947, with Group Captain Peter Townsend, who is said to have asked for an adjoining bedroom to the Princess, then 17.

Indeed, it seems that when the Princess launched the Union-Castle liner, she was already in a relationship with Townsend, who was then 32 and the father of two young sons.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Rory Tingle</dc:creator><dc:modified>2017-12-28T08:37:31.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Did Princess Margaret's married lover sleep with her when she was 17?</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2017-12-28T08:37:31.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5133189/Colour-portraits-WWII-famous-faces-unsung-heroes.html" title="Glitz amid the Blitz: Stunning colour portraits reveal the famous faces and unsung heroes of WWII Britain"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5199687/Ethics-watchdog-says-Canada-PM-Trudeau-broke-conflict-rules.html" title="Ethics watchdog says Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau broke conflict of interest rules when he vacationed on a private island belonging to the Aga khan last Christmas"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5192995/CRAIG-BROWN-Princess-Margaret.html" title="No Margaret, a trifle is not an ashtray!

The Melbourne-based champion pole dancer started up the sport at 18 but during a year long break from pole while studying design in England, she struggled with anorexia and bulimia (inset). In 2016, Amy told FEMAIL that this had then developed into 'flexorexia' - a type of body dysmorphia that meant she was unable to see herself as flexible enough, especially when she compared herself to others. Now, the current Miss Pole Dance Australia has revealed her newfound love of balance and how a passion for naturopathy and acro yoga (bottom right) has helped her learn to love herself and find success in the sport.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Laura House</dc:creator><dc:modified>2017-12-08T09:12:05.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Pole dancing champion Amy Hazel opens up about finding balance</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2017-12-08T09:12:05.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Melbourne</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3492648/Miss-Pole-Dance-Victoria-Amy-Hazel-struggles-flexorexia-believes-flexibility-gained.html" title="Meet the 'Pole Dancing Unicorn': Rainbow-haired fitness guru, 23, with eye-popping skills who says she has 'flexorexia' and trains for SIX HOURS a day so she can become even bendier"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5150113/How-Erin-Henry-success-entrepreneur.html" title="'All you need is Wi-Fi and a dream': How woman, 27, ditched a traditional career to launch an online business empire - and she's made $100,000 in just 10 months"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3492648/Miss-Pole-Dance-Victoria-Amy-Hazel-struggles-flexorexia-believes-flexibility-gained.html" title="Miss Pole Dance Victoria Amy Hazel struggles with 'flexorexia' and believes there is always more flexibility to be gained | Daily Mail Online"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://amyhazel92.com/2016/09/03/its-time-to-make-a-change/" title="It¿s time to make a change ¿ Amy Hazel"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.instagram.com/amyhazel92_nutrition/" title="Amy Hazel (@amyhazel92_nutrition) ¿ Instagram photos and videos"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.instagram.com/amyhazel92/" title="Pole Dancing Unicorn (@amyhazel92) ¿ Instagram photos and videos"></link></item><item><title>Menopause in my 40s put me through hell, reveals Downton star: Actress Phyllis Logan opens up about ‘unfortunate’ experience ahead of new ITV drama</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5149421/Downton-Abbeys-Phyllis-Logan-talks-menopause-hell.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Dec 2017 22:32:30 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5149421</guid><description><![CDATA[Star of English period drama Downton Abbey Phyllis Logan has opened up about going through the menopause in her mid-forties, and the relief at having 'crammed a child out' beforehand.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

She says Meghan learned from a young age to keep the peace between her parents following their divorce.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ninaki continues: ‘She is very poised. A natural mediator. For almost as long as I knew Meghan, her parents weren’t together. It could be hard for her. Sometimes she felt she had to pick sides. She was always trying to make sure each of them was happy.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ninaki says she has always admired Meghan for handling her parents so skilfully from such a young age.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘She’d have to relay messages. It was literally stuff like, “Tell your mother . . .” or “Tell your father . . .” Controlling her emotions is something she learnt back then.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meghan has always maintained her parents’ separation was about as easy as a divorce can be for a child. But Ninaki, who spent many childhood weekends with Meghan, recalls things differently.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Sometimes, one parent needed a little more attention, so Meghan would devote herself to that parent,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘When she was younger, she spent most of her time with Doria. Doria used to dance around the house and have girlie evenings with us. Then, when Meg got to Junior High — around 13 or 14 — she began living with her dad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Tom allowed her more space. Doria was very mothering. She set more boundaries. Tom let us get away with things. He provided a less strict household.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘As a teenager, who doesn’t want that? But as Meg got older she had to parent Tom a little more and she couldn’t do that.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ninaki refuses to elaborate further on Meghan’s father or their relationship. Today, he lives in Mexico and has not featured in the story of her romance with Prince Harry.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I think she’s protecting him,’ is all Ninaki will add.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite being the child of divorced parents, Ninaki says Meghan always wanted a family of her own. ‘She was definitely looking forward to having children. She really wanted to be a mum. She’d see a baby and just . . .’ Ninaki hugs an imaginary child to her breast.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She continues: ‘Trevor asked her to marry him the year before Suits. They were on holiday in Belize, I think. She called me immediately. She was ecstatic and sent me some beautiful pictures.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Meghan came to show me the ring when she got home and was so excited. She asked me to be maid of honour.

There’s Meghan Before Fame and Meghan After Fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Maybe she had started to change before then, but I was refusing to see it. The tone of her voice, her mannerisms, the way she laughed didn’t seem real to me any more.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Even by season two of Suits, she was turning down lunch with us because she said she’d be recognised. I felt if I questioned her behaviour, I’d be left on the outside. Sometimes the truth is not always what you want, is it?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Her time became increasingly important. When she was in town, she’d want you to drop everything to see her. If I was busy, it would be, “Why don’t you want to see me? I’m here. Let’s hang out!”</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There were instances when I felt she developed a sense of entitlement because she was on the show. The breaking point for me came when she wanted to adopt a dog.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘She’d fallen in love with it, but found someone else wanted the dog, too. So she emailed the pet adoption people and explained how she could provide a great life for it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘She spoke of what a great time the dog would have in the Suits Family. I felt that she was playing the Suits card to try to get what she wanted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘She included me and the other bridesmaids in the email chain because she wanted our moral support, I think.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I didn’t respond to it. It left a sour taste in my mouth. We began to talk less. It was shortly after that I spoke to Trevor about the divorce.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I phoned Meghan to speak about it, but she wouldn’t confide in me. It was obvious to me she wasn’t the friend I’d grown up with any more. She had a new circle of friends.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The friendship ended before Meghan began seeing Prince Harry. All Ninaki has heard about it is gossip. But she has her own views on the life path that Meghan has chosen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I think it’s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana’s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I can’t remember exactly when this was, but she was married to Trevor and starring in Suits. She mentioned about wanting to go to London a couple of times.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I wasn’t shocked or even surprised to hear about Prince Harry. I know she used to love The Princess Diaries — films about a commoner who becomes part of a Royal Family. She was very taken with that idea.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our interview is reaching an end. Ninaki must head back to work. Before she goes, I wonder what’s happened to poor Trevor.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It took a long time, but he’s put it in the past now,’ she says. ‘Of course, everyone’s looking at him to see how he’s reacting since the engagement has been announced, but I think he’s handling it quite well.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So well, in fact, he is reportedly working on a film about a girl who is whisked away by a handsome prince. True? Ninaki smiles enigmatically. ‘Trevor is my family now. We’re still friends.’</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Ninaki Priddy (left, with Meghan after graduating high school in 1999) is torn between joy and a deep bewilderment when she remembers the blissfully happy day that her best friend, Meghan Markle, married her ‘eternal love’ six years ago.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Through most of the Queen and Prince Philip’s 70-year marriage, rumours of his alleged affairs have been rife.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Even now, people wonder how he could have left his wife and two young children — Charles and Anne — for a jaunt round far-flung outposts of the Commonwealth in late 1956.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>It lasted more than four months, and there was gossip about wild parties. Did it have any foundation? The jury is out, but it hardly seems credible that anything untoward could have taken place without the knowledge of at least some of the royal yacht Britannia’s crew of 220 men and 20 officers.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The following year, a London-based correspondent for the Baltimore Sun claimed that rumours abounded of Philip’s interest in an unnamed woman, whom he allegedly met regularly in a society photographer’s apartment in the West End. ‘Report Queen, Duke in Rift Over Party Girl’ ran the headline.</strong></p><img id="i-7d954cc1acc320f6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/15/22/41DE35E800000578-0-image-m-10_1510783262579.jpg" height="732" width="962" alt="Suave: Prince Philip, pictured with friend Penny Romsey in 1975, has faced allegations throughout his 70-year marriage that he has embarked on affairs" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Gossip was further fuelled by the fact that the Prince’s private secretary Mike Parker had chosen this moment to tender his resignation. This was taken as a sign that he had to go because he’d been leading Philip astray. In fact, Parker felt he had to resign because his wife had just filed for divorce. According to him, ‘The Duke was incandescent [about the reports]. He was very, very angry. And deeply hurt.’</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>In a break from the rule that the Palace never comments on rumour, the Queen authorised her press secretary to announce: ‘It is quite untrue that there is any rift between the Queen and the Duke.’</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Some people wondered if the unnamed party girl referred to in the Baltimore Sun was Pat Kirkwood, a beautiful musical comedy star.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Rumours about her having an affair with Philip had surfaced as early as 1948, when Princess Elizabeth was pregnant with Prince Charles. Pat, then the highest-paid star on the London stage, was the girlfriend of society photographer Baron Nahum — a member of the Thursday Club in Soho, which Philip regularly attended for a boys’ night out.</strong></p><img id="i-4a9026a9b38b76e2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/15/22/4663BF7500000578-0-image-a-18_1510783349219.jpg" height="925" width="470" alt="Pictured: Late actress Pat Kirkwood was one of the women rumoured to have had a fling with the Duke of Edinburgh" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-b1e9cd676a11a386" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/15/22/4663BF6D00000578-0-image-m-17_1510783339036.jpg" height="925" width="470" alt="Pictured: Sarah Ferguson's mother Susan Barrantes was linked to Prince Philip at one stage" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-large"><strong>S</strong></span>o what is known about her association with the Prince? Years later, Pat said that one evening, after she’d performed in the musical Starlight Roof at the London Hippodrome, Baron had taken Philip and an equerry to her dressing room.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The foursome then went out to dinner at Les Ambassadeurs Club in Hamilton Place, run by a Polish ex-wrestler. Afterwards, they carried on — at Philip’s request — to the Milroy Club for some music and dancing. According to Pat, the Prince wouldn’t let her sit down, dancing with her to whatever the band played. They stayed out until dawn and had scrambled eggs at Baron’s flat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pat insisted that the only time she’d ever met the Prince again was at theatrical command performances.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After she died in 2007, her fourth husband Peter Knight announced that, at her request, he’d one day give ‘correspondence’ between Pat and the Duke of Edinburgh’ to Philip’s official biographer. It would prove that there was no illicit relationship, he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This didn’t explain, however, why Pat and the Prince were corresponding with each other at all.</p><img id="i-9d468aa967fcc385" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/15/22/04BC583B000003E8-0-image-a-19_1510783661210.jpg" height="950" width="962" alt="Happy families: The Queen and Prince Philip, pictured here with children Charles and Anne in 1951, married in 1947 " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another woman with whom the Prince has been romantically linked is Hélène Cordet, formerly Helene Foufounis. They became friends as children when they spent holidays together at her parents’ villa in Le Touquet, France.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Helene, who became the hostess of the BBC variety show Café Continental, had two children while separated from her first husband, but refused to reveal who their father was. So when Philip elected to become godfather to both, some assumed that it must be him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite this, Helene allowed the paternity of her children to remain a mystery — though one of her sons has flatly denied that the Prince is his father.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rumour mill has kept on grinding, even alleging he had a relationship with Sarah Ferguson’s mother, Susan Barrantes. His alleged indiscretions include: the Countess of Westmorland, wife of the Queen’s Master of the Horse; the novelist Daphne du Maurier, who was married to ‘Boy’ Browning, former Comptroller of the Royal Household; the actresses Merle Oberon and Anna Massey; the TV personality Katie Boyle; the Duchess of Abercorn, wife of the Lord Steward of the Royal Household; his cousin, Princess Alexandra; and his carriage-driving companion Lady Brabourne (now Lady Mountbatten).</p><img id="i-9caaa3ec207cf072" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/15/22/025E9EE9000004B0-0-image-m-26_1510783791346.jpg" height="674" width="470" alt="Liaison? Actress Pat Kirkwood at the peak of her fame and glamour " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The satirical magazine Private Eye even linked Prince Philip with Stephen Ward, the society osteopath at the centre of the Profumo affair, which rocked the Conservative government in 1963.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>W</strong>ard, also a member of the Thursday Club, was notorious for throwing wild parties at which ‘The Man in the Mask’ served drinks wearing only a skimpy apron. Private Eye took to referring to Prince Philip as ‘The Naked Waiter’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no evidence that this is true, just as there is no convincing evidence to support any of the other allegations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of all Prince Philip’s respected biographers, only Sarah Bradford is adamant that Philip has had affairs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There is no doubt in my mind at all,’ she told author Gyles Brandreth in 2004. ‘The Duke of Edinburgh has had affairs — yes, full-blown affairs and more than one.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Not with Pat Kirkwood or Merle Oberon or any of those people . . . All that was nonsense, complete nonsense. I don’t think there was ever anything in any of that. But he has affairs. And the Queen accepts it. I think she thinks that’s how men are.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He’s never been one for chasing actresses. His interest is quite different. The women he goes for are always younger than him, usually beautiful and highly aristocratic . . . Philip and Sacha Abercorn certainly had an affair. Without a doubt.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Duchess of Abercorn has denied this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prince Philip’s own response to all the gossip was to tell a reporter in 1992: ‘Have you ever stopped to think that, for the past 40 years, I have never moved anywhere without a policeman accompanying me? So how the hell could I get away with anything like that?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What is not in doubt is that he’s always enjoyed the company of pretty women, preferably years younger than he is.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have seen him gliding around the dance floor at the Royal Yacht Squadron Ball during Cowes week with Penny Romsey, the wife of Lord Brabourne. Neither of them gave a damn who saw them or what anyone might say. And I noticed that Philip, an excellent dancer, was completely in rhythm with the beautiful Penny.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He’s undoubtedly close to her. In 1996, at the height of what was dubbed ‘the war of the Waleses’, a snooping radio ham taped a mobile phone call made by Philip to a ‘plummy-voiced’ woman, in which they discussed the bitter battle between Charles and Diana.</p><img id="i-ed13c3046a35b661" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/15/22/4663BF8900000578-0-image-m-32_1510783867642.jpg" height="655" width="470" alt="Pictured: Cabaret artiste Helene Cordet" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-e437efe26cb896a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/15/22/025EA046000004B0-0-image-a-33_1510783880805.jpg" height="655" width="470" alt="Pictured: Actress Pat Kirkwood, aged 18, in her first major West End hit, Black Velvet, in 1939" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The plummy voice turned out to be Penny’s. But, at one point in the conversation, she handed the phone over to her husband, thus rather destroying any illusion of a clandestine affair.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since 1975, when she was first introduced to Prince Charles, Penny has been popular with the Royal Family.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it is her lively mind, as well as her beauty, that’s turned this former meat-trader’s daughter into a central figure at the heart of royal life. She’s often at Windsor Castle at weekends, and tells both Philip and the Queen about what’s going on in the outside world.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a man who has an eye for a pretty woman but easily gets bored, the Prince finds her company irresistible. He’s taught her the rudiments of carriage driving, and more recently he’s found another reason for them to spend time together — painting in watercolours.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How the Queen feels about it all, we will never know.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Philip has always liked to flirt and make suggestive remarks, and she is the first to make jokes about his lascivious nature.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Equally, she’d never let on if she’d been hurt by rumours of her husband’s supposed dalliances.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Quite possibly, she may even have resorted to her usual trick of burying her head in the sand and pretending nothing was happening.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s lucky for Philip that the Queen has what many would consider an old-fashioned view of marriage. In her early 30s, she remarked: ‘There’s nothing worse than to fence a man in and stop him from doing what he wants.’</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Philip was aghast when a royal maid even joined them on honeymoon </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>F</strong>or a sailor used to travelling light and looking after himself, many aspects of life as a royal came as an unpleasant shock to Prince Philip.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first problem surfaced on his otherwise blissful honeymoon in Scotland — and her name was Bobo MacDonald. As Princess Elizabeth’s devoted maid of many years, she’d automatically accompanied them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What Philip hadn’t expected, though, was to find her at his bride’s side at all times of the day and night — even when the Princess used the bathroom. Not surprisingly, this irritated him: he resented not being able to be alone with his wife whenever he wanted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Princess, however, genuinely couldn’t understand what the fuss was about. She was used to being constantly surrounded by staff and often ignored their presence.</p><img id="i-9bc86c69af90166c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/15/22/4663BF8100000578-0-image-m-36_1510783897624.jpg" height="706" width="962" alt="Just married: A problem surfaced on his otherwise blissful honeymoon in Scotland — and her name was Bobo MacDonald. As Princess Elizabeth’s devoted maid of many years, she’d automatically accompanied them " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The battle over Bobo would never be quite resolved. Like many female retainers who have devoted their lives to royal service, she always faintly resented the presence of her mistress’s husband. Philip, in turn, would try to keep her firmly in her place. He believed Bobo’s role was to open the curtains each morning and let the dogs in — nothing more.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eventually, Prince and maid came to an amicable, non-verbal agreement to keep out of each other’s way. As for the Queen, she viewed Bobo — who served her for 67 years — as a friend and a crucial link with her childhood, as Bobo had been her nanny.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not only was Philip unable to escape the maid on his honeymoon, but he was forced to live with his in-laws at Buckingham Palace for the first year of his marriage, while Clarence House was being refurbished at a cost of £50,000 for him and his bride.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Princess Elizabeth was already well aware that it would be difficult for a man so used to doing what he wanted to be tied to a suite of rooms in a huge, old-fashioned palace, where everything was subject to endless protocol. She also knew that he found many of the courtiers pompous and ridiculously stuck in their ways.</p><img id="i-8d857ccebeff60c0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/15/22/466446FE00000578-5087027-image-a-60_1510785243008.jpg" height="858" width="470" alt="Precious memories: The Queen (bottom right) with her nurse Margaret 'Bobo' Macdonald in 1932 " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Life at court was very frustrating for him at first,’ said the late Lord Brabourne, whose wife, Patricia Mountbatten, was Philip’s cousin. ‘It was very stuffy. Tommy Lascelles (private secretary to the King) was impossible. They were bloody to him. They patronised him. They treated him as an outsider. It wasn’t much fun.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He laughed it off, of course, but it must have hurt. I’m not sure Princess Elizabeth noticed it. She probably didn’t see it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘In a way, marriage hardly changed her life… She was able to carry on much as before. In getting married, she didn’t sacrifice anything. His life changed completely. He gave up everything.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>B</strong>ack in 1947, courtiers and senior members of the household wielded great influence, often making important decisions over a few large whiskies or a rubber of bridge. Unobtrusively powerful, they never admitted to mistakes, never complained about one another, never resigned and were never proved wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The straight-talking Prince — who once described himself as a cosmopolitan European — didn’t fit into this world one little bit. And the palace old guard found him abrasive and rude.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His cousin, Lady Pamela Hicks, recalled: ‘He knew he was going into the lions’ den. He was very conscious of the way he’d been treated and how hard he would have to fight for his position and his independence [against the Establishment]. What he didn’t know was just how fearsome it was going to be.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the first few months of married life, Philip was given a desk job at the Admiralty, which did little to improve his mood. ‘I was just a dogsbody, shuffling ships around,’ is how he described it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Later, he was posted to a residential staff course at the Royal Naval College in Greenwich — a welcome respite from the palace, if not his wife. He also became patron to several organisations, and joined Princess Elizabeth on official visits and tours.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No matter how busy he was, Philip found time to have fun with his old friend Mike Parker as part of the Thursday Club — a group of men who had weekly meetings in a private room at Wheeler’s fish restaurant in Soho.</p><img id="i-3171c3adff44b1c5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/15/22/058C5552000003E8-0-image-a-37_1510783922787.jpg" height="894" width="962" alt="The happy couple: The Queen and Prince Philip line dancing on a royal visit to Canada" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-58ab63a99a08ca5c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/15/22/05A72474000003E8-0-image-m-45_1510783993455.jpg" height="574" width="470" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-d990d9789dc3205" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/15/22/058B1071000003E8-0-image-a-46_1510784001374.jpg" height="574" width="470" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The club was started by photographer Baron Nahum, and there was usually ten to 15 people at each gathering. Members included actors David Niven, James Robertson Justice and Peter Ustinov; the poet John Betjeman; and Iain MacLeod (later Chancellor of the Exchequer).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Princess Elizabeth referred to this motley crew as ‘Philip’s funny friends’. There were rumours of wild parties, even of orgies — all denied by Parker — but exactly what went on at the club has never been substantiated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whatever the truth, marriage had not mellowed Philip. He was a man of his time and background, just as his wife was a woman of hers — and he didn’t see why he shouldn’t continue to enjoy jesting with cronies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The palace old guard didn’t approve: there was great concern about Philip’s apparent desire to continue bachelor friendships with people of somewhat dubious reputation.

King George decided their connection to Nazi Germany was still too shaming.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All four had married German aristocrats in the Thirties. Worse, two of Philip’s brothers-in-law had been active in the Nazi party, and had ended up joining the elite ranks of Hitler’s SS and SA (the paramilitary wing of the Nazi party.).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘So soon after the war, you couldn’t have “the Hun”,’ recalled Philip’s cousin Lady Pamela Hicks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I think Philip understood, but the sisters certainly didn’t. For years afterwards, they’d say: “Why weren’t we allowed to come to your wedding?” They weren’t exactly Stormtroopers.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It wasn’t until 2006 that Prince Philip broke a 60-year public silence about his family’s Nazi ties. Like many Germans, he explained, his family had found much to admire in Hitler’s early attempts to restore Germany’s power and prestige.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There was a great improvement in things like trains running on time and building,’ Philip explained. ‘There was a sense of hope after the depressing chaos of the Weimar Republic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I can understand people latching onto something or somebody who appeared to be appealing to their patriotism and trying to get things going. You can understand how attractive it was.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He stressed, however, that he was never ‘conscious’ of anyone in the family expressing anti-Semitic views.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whether they did or not, Philip’s mother, Princess Alice — whose father Prince Louis of Battenberg (later anglicised to Mountbatten) was German — actually risked her life to save persecuted Jews in Athens during the war.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For her actions, she was awarded Israel’s highest award for a foreigner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 1994, Philip and his sister, Sophie, went to Jerusalem to receive the award post-humously on behalf of their late mother.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The prince himself never had any Nazi sympathies. One of the greatest influences in his life was Dr Kurt Hahn, a German Jew who helped found Germany’s Salem school — then one of the finest in Europe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Philip was sent there at 12 at the behest of his sister, Theodora, but he lasted less than a year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">First, he got into trouble for mocking the Nazi salute, and then — when the Hitler Youth began to infiltrate the school — Theodora agreed that he should return to England.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, Dr Hahn was running foul of the Nazis, who couldn’t allow a Jew to educate the youth of Germany. He was arrested and imprisoned, but influential people from all over Europe, including British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, petitioned Hitler to set him free.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a result, Hahn was allowed to emigrate to Britain, where he established a new school in Scotland — called Gordonstoun — which Philip joined in the autumn term of 1934.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Apart from his brief German schooling and visits to his sisters, Philip spent hardly any of his childhood in Germany.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And while he may have German blood in his veins, so, too, do the Windsors — who changed their name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in 1917, during World War I.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, the Royal Family still retain the German custom — introduced by Prince Albert — of opening their presents on Christmas Eve rather than Christmas morning.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The move to Clarence House was a welcome reprieve. Under Philip’s supervision, it had been kitted out with the latest household gadgets including an intercom system, washing machines and an electric trouser press.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 1949, the Prince became first lieutenant to HMS Chequers, the lead ship of the Mediterranean destroyer fleet, based in Malta. Princess Elizabeth frequently flew out for lengthy stays.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her time in Malta has often been described as the only time she could live like an ordinary naval wife, driving herself, going to the hairdresser and shopping. In truth, it was a life less ordinary: their villa had a staff of 19 and the Princess also had her lady-in-waiting and detective in tow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 1950, much to Philip’s delight, he was appointed to his first command: the frigate HMS Magpie. Back home, however, the news was grim: the King was ailing with a bug he couldn’t shake off.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The following year, Philip took leave and came home to share his wife’s duties as she stood in for her father at official functions.</p><img id="i-5d92e67538a136a5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/15/23/131A81E4000005DC-5087027-Pictured_Martin_Charteris_Princess_Elizabeth_s_private_secretary-a-1_1510790421476.jpg" height="722" width="962" alt="Pictured: Martin Charteris, Princess Elizabeth’s private secretary (pictured together above), broke the news to Philip of the King's death " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">An operation to remove one of the King’s lungs seemed to go well, so the next year the royal couple flew to Nairobi on the first leg of a Commonwealth tour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was Mike Parker who picked up news of the King’s death on a shortwave radio after speaking to Martin Charteris, Princess Elizabeth’s private secretary, and woke Philip at a Kenyan lodge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Parker, his private secretary, the Prince looked as though the whole world had dropped on his shoulders.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lady Pamela Hicks, who was also there, recalled that Philip’s first reaction was to put a newspaper over his face and remain motionless for five minutes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>P</strong>amela said: ‘And then he pulled himself together and said he must go and find the Princess… She was having a rest in her bedroom… And so they went for a walk in the garden and you could tell, walking up and down, up and down, that he was telling her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘She came back to the lodge — and one just thought, this poor girl who really adored her father; they were very close. I think I gave her a hug and said how sorry I was. And then suddenly I thought, my God, but she’s Queen!’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ‘awful thing’, added Pamela, was that the couple hadn’t expected her to take on the job until they were in their 50s.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-0b190a60-ca59-11e7-b5e4-2d5766c79298">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox">Seeing the young girl as Queen of Great Britain as she drove away, I felt her sadness as she just raised her hand to us as we stood there silent, cameras on the ground</div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Elizabeth requested that no pictures be taken as she left the lodge, but there were a couple of photographers already outside.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We stood silently outside the lodge,’ one of them recalled, ‘as the cars drove away in a cloud of dust, not one of us taking a shot at that historic moment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Seeing the young girl as Queen of Great Britain as she drove away, I felt her sadness as she just raised her hand to us as we stood there silent, cameras on the ground.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the Queen arrived back at Heathrow on February 7, 1952, Winston Churchill and the rest of the Privy Council lined up to greet her. At that moment, Philip knew that his life had changed for ever.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Years later, he recalled: ‘People used to come to me and ask me what to do. In 1952, the whole thing changed, very, very considerably.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>C</strong>hurchill insisted he and the new Queen move to the palace — an enormous wrench for Philip, for whom Clarence House had been the only home he’d ever been able to call his own.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the Queen, however, it was simply a matter of going to the place where she’d lived very happily for much of her life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the Prince, problems soon multiplied. ‘Philip was constantly being squashed, snubbed, ticked off, rapped over the knuckles,’ said Mike Parker. ‘It was intolerable. The problem was simply that Philip had energy, ideas, get-up-and-go, and that didn’t suit the Establishment, not one bit.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In his new role, Philip sought the guidance of Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands who, as the husband of Queen Juliana, had 15 years’ experience as consort.</p><img id="i-e2445c1f77f6f451" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/15/22/00013BC400000CB2-0-image-a-47_1510784321529.jpg" height="928" width="962" alt="In 1949, the Prince became first lieutenant to HMS Chequers, the lead ship of the Mediterranean destroyer fleet, based in Malta.

You can’t ignore it because some of it may be justified. And even if it isn’t, it may be politic to heed it. But don’t let it get you down. In this job, you need a skin like an elephant.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For Philip at this point, frustration, irritation and disappointment were daily occurrences. But, with Parker’s help, he set about modernising the palace, much to the consternation of the old guard.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Among other things, he started a footman training programme, set in hand redecoration of the gloomy private apartments and installed a nearby kitchen so that food didn’t have to be traipsed along miles of draughty corridors.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And as chairman of the Coronation Commission, he oversaw every detail of the ceremony.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leaving nothing to chance, he even stood on the palace balcony to find the best angle from which the Queen — still wearing her heavy crown — could watch the fly-past after the ceremony without getting a crick in her neck.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But losing his career and being relegated to backroom status couldn’t help but occasionally grate on him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His chief role in the Coronation on June 2, 1953, was to kneel before his wife, taking the ancient oath of fealty: ‘I, Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, do become your liege man of life and limb and of earthly worship…’ He then had to stand, kiss her cheek and back away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But at the rehearsal, possibly feeling a bit emasculated, he mumbled the words quickly, missed the Queen’s cheek and retired backwards fast. The Queen told him off: ‘Don’t be silly, Philip. Come back here and do it properly.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Half a million people turned up in the rain to line the Coronation route. Inside Westminster Abbey, photographer Cecil Beaton noted the Queen’s ‘sugar pink cheeks and tightly curled hair and her demeanour of simplicity and humility’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As she walked, he said, she allowed ‘her heavy skirt to swing backwards and forwards in a beautiful rhythmic effect’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The Coronation was a deeply moving spiritual experience for her,’ said the Queen’s cousin Margaret Rhodes, ‘especially the part which wasn’t filmed — when she stood bareheaded, wearing only a white linen shift as the Archbishop of Canterbury marked the sign of the cross on her with the words: “As Solomon was anointed by Zadok the priest, so be thou anointed, blessed and consecrated as Queen over the people thy God hath given thee to govern.”’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When it came to Philip’s part, he performed well, but his touch on the crown was a bit heavy-handed and his wife had to adjust it. Over the years, he never forgot his pledge to be her ‘liege man of life and limb’. At times, he’d be irascible, laddish and difficult — but he would always give the Queen his whole-hearted support. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Through most of the Queen and Prince Philip's 70-year marriage, rumours of his alleged affairs have been rife. Even now, people wonder how he could have left his young family to go for a jaunt around the far-flung outposts of the Commonwealth in late 1956. It lasted more than four months, and there was gossip about wild parties. Did it have any foundation? The late glamorous actress Pat Kirkland (centre), Sarah Ferguson's mother (top right) and Hélène Cordet (bottom right) have all been romantically linked to the Duke of Edinburgh over the years, despite his marriage to the Queen in 1947 (inset).
