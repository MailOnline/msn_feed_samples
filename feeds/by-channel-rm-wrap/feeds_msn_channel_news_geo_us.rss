The £175,000 three-bed home could last fifty years - or meet the crumbling cliff edge in less than five. The outgoing owners of the aptly named Cliff Farm near Cromer in Norfolk have lived happily in their home for 18 years but decided to sell two years ago when it was put on the market for £400,000. But its perilous position on the Norfolk coast, where other properties have been lost to erosion, put off potential buyers. Now, they have dramatically lowered the price. The auctioneer handling the sale said that whoever gambles on the detached cottage may find it at the bottom of the 80ft cliff in a few years time.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Zoie O'brien</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T15:54:24.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Gorgeous Norfolk cottage on sale for £175,000, but there's a catch..</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T15:54:24.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content></item><item><title>Teenager, 16, missed his GCSE chemistry exam after headteacher ordered him out of hall for not wearing proper school trousers </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5812629/Spondon-school-boy-not-allowed-sit-chemistry-GCSE-exam-wasnt-wearing-uniform.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 14:20:39 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5812629</guid><description><![CDATA[Jack Page, 16 (pictured) turned up at West Park School, in Spondon, Derbyshire, to do his exam but claims he was ushered out of the room when he was spotted wearing jeans and trainers.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Three years ago Kalief Browder hanged himself, haunted by his ordeal at Rikers Island Prison where he had been held without trial for 33 months. He had spent nearly two years in solitary confinement where at times he was starved; he was beaten by gang members but also by prison guards – the latter of which was caught on security footage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When he was finally released on May 29, 2013 (no charges were brought against him), he told his family this was his ‘re-birth at life’. But Kalief struggled with <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-22c1fb80-6992-11e8-8892-7d546f47b569">depression</a> and mental illness and just over two years later, on June 6, 2015, he took his own life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The night before his death, the 22-year-old Bronx native told his mother: ‘Ma, I just can’t take it anymore’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His family’s ordeal continued when in October 2016, his mother – his greatest advocate and staunchest defender Venida Browder – died of a heart attack. Many claimed she died of a broken heart. She had spoken out publicly advocating for prison reform and even collaborated with rapper Jay Z and now-disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein to produce a documentary miniseries about her son titled, Time: The Kalief Browder Story.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Scroll down for video </strong></p><img id="i-a4ea38b15aed4f35" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/23/4CF25E2100000578-0-It_s_been_three_years_since_Kalief_Browder_took_his_own_life_aft-m-17_1528237243712.jpg" height="438" width="306" alt="It's been three years today since Kalief Browder (above) took his own life after being haunted by his ordeal at Rikers Island Prison where he had been held without trial for 33 months." class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-5088f64669297fb7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/23/4CEAD93500000578-0-image-a-18_1528237252631.jpg" height="438" width="306" alt="His brother, Akeem Browder (above) is leading the family's fight for criminal justice reform and wants to prevent others from experiencing what Kalief did" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-7ca05f616215ea35" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/4CEAD7B200000578-5810107-Kalief_was_arrested_in_2010_aged_16_when_he_was_accused_of_steal-a-1_1528290531544.jpg" height="664" width="634" alt="Kalief was arrested in 2010 aged 16 when he was accused of stealing a backpack with a camera, credit card, iPod Touch and $700 from another teen in the Bronx.

He's pictured above in a childhood photo" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">His brother Akeem had become a campaigner for criminal justice reform in light of Kalief’s imprisonment but has struggled to gain the support of New York’s politicians. Akeem wants to make his brother’s death mean something and today, three years on, he’s as determined as ever to realize that hope. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Speaking to DailyMail.com to mark the anniversary of Kalief’s passing, he said: ‘My family just went through having our second Mother’s Day without our mom last month. Then following Mother’s Day, its Kalief’s birthday on May 25th, this was our third year without him is the third year without him. Then June 6th he committed suicide.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We as a family have three dates that we bearing every year and yet every year that has passed so far, we have elected officials that come to us who want to take photos and do stories with us as a family knowing they are up for re-election, but have not acted on criminal justice reform.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kalief was just 16 years old when he was arrested on May 15, 2010 after being accused of stealing a backpack with a camera, credit card, iPod Touch and $700 from another teen in the Bronx.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kalief told arresting officers that he did not ‘rob anyone’ and allowed them to search him. Though officers did not find the backpack, Kalief was still arrested and taken to the 48th Police Precinct Station where he was interrogated by another officer and prosecutor. </p><img id="i-4bcb434b45764d0d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/22/4CF25E1100000578-0-image-a-2_1528235710749.jpg" height="352" width="634" alt="While in Rikers for 33 months, Kalief was beaten by gang members and prison guards.

At his arraignment, bail was set at $3,000. His family could not raise the amount and Kalief was sent to Rikers Island where he was imprisoned at the Robert N. Davoren Center (R.N.D.C.).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When his parents came up with money for his bail, it was denied, forcing Kalief to stay behind bars.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To try to protect himself from gang members and prison guards, Kalief tried to gain physical strength by doing push-ups and pull-ups inside his cell. But even becoming bigger in size could not protect him from being attacked, especially by prison guards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On September 23, 2012, the teen was filmed in handcuffs being brutally assaulted by guards and the footage was eventually leaked to the public following his death. Besides facing violence often, even more alarming is that Kalief spent nearly two years in solitary confinement, where he was still beaten by corrections officers when he was in the shower.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Part of the reason why his case never went to trial is due to the fact the assistant district attorney kept delaying it by deferring the criminal proceedings. In fact, it was deferred a total of 33 times until a judge released Kalief from Rikers on May 29, 2013, dismissing the case against him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Soon after his release, Kalief passed his G.E.D. exam and enrolled at the Bronx Community College (BCC) where he completed 11 credits and had a grade point average of 3.5. But due to depression, Kalief did not attend BCC in the fall and re-enrolled in the spring with hopes of finishing out the school year strong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kalief harbored intense feelings of paranoia and had anti-psychotics prescribed for him. He attempted suicide six months after his release from prison.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also wanted to help support his mother so he worked for a period of time as a security guard, but was let go once the employer allegedly learned of his history with mental illness.  </p><img id="i-caf1479065721c08" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/22/4CF25E1A00000578-0-image-a-4_1528235731039.jpg" height="464" width="634" alt="Part of the reason why his case never went to trial is due to the fact the assistant district attorney kept delaying it by deferring the criminal proceedings.

During his time inside the horror facility, he spent nearly two years in solitary confinement where at times he was starved. Kalief was also beaten by gang members, but also prison guards - the latter of which was caught on security footage (bottom right). He was released with no charges brought against him in 2013, but he struggled with depression and mental illness before taking his own life. His 35-year-old brother Akeem Browder (bottom left) had become a campaigner for criminal justice reform in light of Kalief’s imprisonment but has struggled to gain the support of New York’s politicians. Akeem wants to make his brother’s death mean something and today, three years on, he’s as determined as ever to realize that hope.

Why shouldn't he be?' Gennifer Flowers asked Tuesday night during a Fox News Channel interview. Flowers was referring to the case of Juanita Broaddrick, a 75-year-old former nursing home administrator who told 'Dateline NBC' interview in 1999 that the then-Arkansas attorney general raped her in a Little Rock hotel room. She also made reference to Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey, two women who accused Clinton of sexual misconduct, while mocking the president for being 'a huge abuser of the #MeToo movement.' The feminist groundswell, Flowers said on 'The Ingraham Angle,' has largely ignored Clinton's accusers while it makes mincemeat of Hollywood's moguls and leading men.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>David Martosko</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T14:40:14.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Former Bill Clinton lover Gennifer Flowers wants him charged with RAPE</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T14:40:14.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5807897/Bill-Clinton-issues-non-apology-tries-clean-Monica-Lewinsky-mess.html" title="Bill Clinton issues ANOTHER non-apology as he tries to clean up Monica Lewinsky mess by saying he 'did apologize' to the whole world at staged Prayer Breakfast – and insists he's a #MeToo backer despite long trail of accusations"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5252487/Juanita-Broaddrick-slams-Oprah-Golden-Globes-speech.html" title="'Funny I've never heard you mention my name': Bill Clinton rape accuser Juanita Broaddrick slams Oprah for addressing #MeToo movement in Golden Globes speech "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5090399/Bill-Clinton-accused-sexual-assault-four-women.html" title="EXCLUSIVE: Bill Clinton is facing NEW accusations of sexual assault by four women while the former president was working with a billionaire playboy and flying on his private jet nicknamed Air F**k One, claims Clinton author"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4999202/Bill-Clinton-rape-accuser-slams-Monica-Lewinsky-MeToo.html" title="'Your silence was deafening': Woman who accused Bill Clinton of rape lashes out at Monica Lewinsky over her #MeToo tweet because she failed to speak up when she needed her"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/5794001521001/gennifer-flowers-levels-bombshell-allegation-against-clinton" title="Gennifer Flowers levels new allegation against Bill Clinton | On Air Videos | Fox News"></link></item><item><title>'It's like something from Grand Theft Auto': Soldier steals a TANK before leading police on a two-hour chase around Virginia</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5812363/Soldier-steals-TANK-leading-police-two-hour-chase-Virginia.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 13:21:31 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5812363</guid><description><![CDATA[The soldier stole an armored personnel carrier from Fort Pickett before driving it more than 60 miles down two highways to Richmond, where he eventually stopped and was arrested.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Witness video captured the moment the 20-year-old mom was struck by officers as she was being taken into custody on the beach. The officers had questioned her about an unopened bottle of alcohol, but she passed two breathalyzer tests. They moved to arrest her when she refused to give her last name. On Monday, authorities said the two cops would not face charges over hitting Weinman. In her GMA interview, the young mom's lawyer said she wasn't hit with the most serious charges until the video came out and the officers came under fire.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ashley Collman</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T15:00:51.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Beachgoer beaten by cops speaks out as they are CLEARED of assault</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T15:00:51.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5811843/Judge-sentenced-Brock-Turner-recalled-California-goes-polls.html" title="Judge who sentenced Brock Turner to six months in jail for sexual assault loses his job in a victory for the #MeToo movement"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5809489/Pablo-Escobars-family-Colombias-Serna-charged-probe.html" title="Narcos family assets seized: Cocaine cartel leader Pablo Escobar's widow and son are charged with money laundering for Colombian drug dealer - and are stripped of $1million each"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5810241/Emotional-David-Spade-hugs-friend-street-Kates-death.html" title="'I don't think everyone knew how f****** funny she was': Grieving actor David Spade posts a sweet snap of sister-in-law Kate at one of his book signings "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5810997/Woman-trial-slaying-nephew-admitted-involved-years-long-secret-affair.html" title="Texas woman on trial for stabbing her nephew to death admits they were involved in a years-long secret affair"></link></item><item><title>'Knifeman' hands himself in and is arrested for attempted murder after his ex-partner and their one-year-old baby were seriously injured in stabbing</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5812407/Suspect-arrested-attempted-murder-ex-partner-baby.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 12:54:51 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5812407</guid><description><![CDATA[Rehan Khan, 25, was wanted in connection with the stabbing of 32-year-old Salma Sheikh and her 11-month-old baby in Feltham on Monday.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

The former teen idol reportedly called producers of an A&amp;E documentary after he fell ill and told them he had liver disease. In the recorded conversation, Cassidy said there was no sign of dementia and it was 'complete alcohol poisoning.' The former 'Partridge Family' star says he had lied by telling friends and family he had stopped drinking.

Built between 1850 and 1852, and upgraded in 1859 with a new building that completely encased the original gun tower, the Grade II-listed fortification is on sale for £400,000.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Simon Rushton</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T14:24:12.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>This island fort is cheaper than a London flat</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T14:24:12.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5707103/Property-prices-biggest-fall-eight-years-average-value-falls-7-000-220-000.html" title="Property prices see biggest fall for eight years: Millions of homeowners hit as the average value falls by £7,000 to £220,000 "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/property/article-5611865/Halifax-reveals-places-home-makes-job.html" title="Ten places where your property makes more than you do: Homeowners can 'earn' up to £51k more from their properties than from their job"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2663259/Realm-beautiful-decay-Haunting-photos-abandoned-mansions-shuttered-asylums-deserted-amusement-parks-time-stands-still.html" title="Realm of beautiful decay: Haunting photos of abandoned mansions, shuttered asylums and deserted amusement parks where time stands still"></link></item><item><title>Robbers break into Barcelona home of Shakira and her World Cup-winning boyfriend Gerard Piqué and steal luxury watches and jewellery while his parents are sleeping upstairs</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5812037/Robbers-break-Barcelona-home-Shakira-Gerard-Piqu.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 11:09:37 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5812037</guid><description><![CDATA[Gerard Piqué's parents were sleeping upstairs at the couple's home in Barcelona, Spain when the break-in happened last night.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Mr McIntyre had been picking up his youngest boy Oscar, 10, when two robbers on a moped smashed the window of his £120,000 Range Rover with a hammer. The gang then threatened him with a knife  in front of his terrified child and ripped the £15,000 Rolex from his wrist in an attack lasting no more than 30 seconds. The comedian, 42, returns to the stage tomorrow night in Dublin for the latest gig in his 104-date Big World Tour - and joked that without a watch he could be late. When asked about the Irish show he told MailOnline: 'The show must go on', and in typical style he cracked a gag about his own terrifying ordeal, adding: 'I'm not sure if I'm going to arrive there on time, but I'm going to get a new watch later.'</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Joseph Curtis</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T15:55:23.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Michael McIntyre confirms he will continue his Big World Tour</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T15:55:23.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>London</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5809943/Footage-shows-moment-Michael-McIntyre-attacked-moped-muggers.html" title="The terrifying moment that sums up lawless London: Bystander video captures knife-wielding moped gang attacking comedian Michael McIntyre and stealing his £15k Rolex as his young son watches just inches away "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5809721/Video-shows-hero-bystanders-tackling-moped-attackers-raided-London-watch-shop.html" title="London fights back: As a crime wave grips the capital, new video shows how FOUR hero bystanders tackled Regent Street moped gang - including a fearless delivery man who came out swinging with his TROLLEY "></link></item><item><title>Paperchase launches Father's Day cards for MUMS with slogans including 'Who needs a dad when your mum has balls?' so single parents don't feel excluded </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5811481/Paperchase-launches-Fathers-Day-cards-MUMS.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 08:15:54 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5811481</guid><description><![CDATA[The cards are designed by London-based Stevie Rowing-Parker, creator of Happy Father's Day Mum, and cost £2.99.

Last week she caused an explosion like a mushroom cloud with her comments about rape.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Speaking from personal experience at the Hay Literary Festival (when she was an 18-year-old student in Melbourne, Australia, a rugby player dragged her into her car and punched her in the face before raping her) she said rape wasn’t the worst thing that had ever happened to her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was determined to get over it. To not live the rest of her life as a damaged victim — or a ‘rapee’ — as she put it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She then went on to call for the lowering of punishment for rape and said society should not see it as a ‘spectacularly violent crime,’ but instead view it more as ‘lazy, careless and insensitive. Just bad sex’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, Ms Greer, who is not averse to publicity, could not have been unaware of the reaction she was likely to get from other feminists and the response to her pronouncements was visceral. How dare she, a revered feminist, trivialise such a terrible crime? How dare she let the sisterhood down in this way?</p><img id="i-a49082a1e58a11a1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/23/4CF427D900000578-0-image-m-5_1528239015630.jpg" height="803" width="634" alt="Like Germaine Greer, Murray has been determined not to let what happened to her dominate the rest of her life " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nevertheless, reflecting on my own personal, very similar experience, I had an understanding of what she meant when she said she had been able to get over her rape and get on with her life. Because I had been able to do the very same.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As dawn broke following my rape, I arrived back at my student house. I showered my attacker away, threw the clothes I’d been wearing in the bin, went to bed and slept.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I woke up with a humdinger of a hangover and a sense of absolute fury. I was angry with myself for making myself vulnerable. It was my fault, I thought, because I’d had so much to drink. It didn’t occur to me to make a complaint to the police. I don’t think I even realised that a crime had been committed. But, of course, it had.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I never told anyone at the time what had happened. I made jokes to friends about the bruises on my face, saying I had fallen over and bumped into doors in my drunken state.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I know now that this was the classic response of women who’ve been beaten. To this day, I’ve never named the rapist. He’s dead now, but I know he had a wife and children and I have never wanted to shame or upset them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But even then, in my youth and innocence and long before a woman’s right to enjoy a sex life was accepted, I told myself I had nothing to be ashamed of. I’d been silly to be so drunk, but what had happened was not my fault and it was, frankly, best forgotten. I hadn’t been a virgin. He was just another bloke.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just like Germaine, I thought to myself: You’ve been annoyed, not destroyed. Put it down to experience. Get on with life. Don’t be a victim. And never put yourself in such a weak position again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I like to think in doing so that I took some of the power from the man in question and reclaimed it for myself by refusing to let my life be dominated by his abusive behaviour.</p><img id="i-b7039ccc734bab81" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/23/4CF4279600000578-0-image-m-6_1528239171424.jpg" height="892" width="634" alt="Germaine suggested the sentence for the offence might be reduced to 200 hours’ community service and perhaps an ‘r’ tattoo on the rapist’s hand, arm or cheek" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">That said, it’s all very well for women like Germaine and me —tough, outspoken and open about the sexual experiences that we enjoyed in our youth — to look back on the one we did not consent to and say it was not the worst thing that happened to us. We were not badly hurt and we felt no need to let one 20-minute unpleasant experience ruin the rest of our rich and fulfilling lives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I differ from Germaine on the following point: Despite my own experience, I also believe that it is profoundly dangerous to diminish such a crime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For some victims, there is none of the violence we generally associate with rape — no beating around the head, no strangulation, no wielding of a knife and no fear of death.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nevertheless, the very act of penetration without consent is a violation, and that in itself is violence. I fully acknowledge that some women’s lives are destroyed by such an act. The virginity which they held as a precious commodity may have been taken, sexually transmitted infection may have been passed on and explanations to a husband or boyfriend may have been deeply traumatic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Worst of all, a pregnancy may have been the result.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rape is violation whether it’s perpetrated by a stranger, a husband, a friend or a colleague and whether there’s additional violence or not.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no shame in being destroyed by it. Not everyone finds it possible to move on from the experience and put it behind them. I put my rape behind me but I never forgot it. I suspect for both myself and Germaine Greer it has remained a powerful influence on the work we’ve done in sexual politics throughout our lives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, thankfully, so many advances have been achieved in the past 50 years in understanding sexual violence and changing the law to reflect the reality. I fully applaud all of them.</p><img id="i-cc34682b04735b25" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/00/4CF466FF00000578-5810197-image-a-14_1528241360222.jpg" height="507" width="634" alt="Jenni Murray pictured with her parents in Blackpool in 1951. Losing them in her 50s at the same time as undergoing a mastectomy and chemotherapy as a result of breast cancer was infinitely worse than being raped, she says " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let’s consider for a moment, that when a 19th century woman was raped, it was her father’s or her husband’s rights which had been violated. Now we understand that the crime was committed against a woman — not her male relatives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the early 20th century, any woman who appeared in court claiming rape was treated like a child. The judge was required to give the jury a corroboration warning, stating that women and children have a tendency to lie about sexual matters. This archaic warning was rightly removed —but not until the late 1990s.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was clearly unfair to suggest a victim may be lying and, of course, corroborating evidence is difficult to find when only two people know what happened. It’s her word against his. The alleged victim’s sexual history can now only be raised in England at the discretion of the judge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the Seventies, Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author of the groundbreaking Against Our Will, argued that rape was motivated by the need for domination and not by uncontrollable lust. She also laid to rest the idea that a woman wearing a short skirt was ‘asking for it’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, one positive consequence of the ‘MeToo’ and ‘TimesUp’ movements is that men have been left in no doubt that uninvited sexual activity is an abuse of power and can lead to serious consequences.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most encouragingly, young men now want to be part of the conversation with the new generation of young feminists, who are, thankfully, well able to stand up for themselves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This generation of young men want to know how to flirt, how to behave correctly in their relationships with women and how to ensure that the sex they engage in is good sex. They are open too to the idea of commitment and love.</p><img id="i-e850c417075ba92c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/23/4CF427D400000578-0-image-m-7_1528239196523.jpg" height="836" width="634" alt="'Yes, I was able to move on and enjoy my life but that doesn’t preclude me from wishing I’d seen the brute punished,' said Murray" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">None of this is to say there will no longer be rape — just that women are more protected by the law and the conventional mores of society than ever before. Something for which we should all feel grateful.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like Germaine, I was fortunate enough not to be badly hurt by my rapist and thankfully was not destroyed by him or made forever fearful of the opposite sex.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But this does not mean I expect the same response from all victims. Unlike Germaine, I fully understand that every woman reacts differently to being raped and those, like me, who recovered should not be considered stronger or superior to those who are broken by such assaults on them.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for a fitting punishment, Germaine suggested the sentence for the offence might be reduced to 200 hours’ community service and perhaps an ‘r’ tattoo on the rapist’s hand, arm or cheek.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is where I deviate from her view most vociferously. I would prefer the legal system take complaints seriously from the moment they are made, investigate them thoroughly and correctly and provide an atmosphere in court that’s carefully controlled by a well-informed judiciary. Then, if the jury convicts, a prison sentence should most definitely follow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Germaine claimed the legal system cannot cope because rape is so common and it always comes down to the difficult issue of consent, with the victims becoming little more than ‘bits of evidence’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Frankly, I would have been quite content to be a ‘bit of evidence’ if I’d had the guts to go to the police back in 1969. Yes, I was able to move on and enjoy my life but that doesn’t preclude me from wishing I’d seen the brute punished.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>As a drama student in 1969, Jenni Murray (right and inset) once got to help a professional company of actors but at an after-show party, what started out as a thrilling night of drinking and chatting took a very dark turn.

And sources say Rodman, who has famously built a bizarre friendship with the dictator in recent years, will arrive in the country on June 11 and could even play a role in negotiations. 'No matter what you might think about his presence. One thing's for sure the ratings will be huge,' a source told the New York Post. 'A lot of times in situations that involve complex diplomacy countries like to identify ambassadors of goodwill and whether you agree with it or not Dennis Rodman fits the bill.' Darren Prince, Rodman's rep, said the basketball legend had 'talked about it' but had not made any travel plans to Singapore - although he said he was willing to go if the world leaders wanted his input.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Hannah Parry</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T04:48:00.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Dennis Rodman 'will be at meeting between Trump and Kim Jong un' </mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T04:48:00.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Kim Jong-un,Singapore,Donald Trump,NBA</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5805565/White-House-reveals-date-time-meeting-Trump-Kim.html" title="It's on!

The armed robbers smashed his £120,000 Range Rover's window around 15 times and the comedian can be seen flinching as they waved a knife (circled left) and a hammer in front of his terrified son Oscar, 10. In a disgusting new tactic the gang struck as soon as the schoolboy was in the car knowing the comic would not risk them harming him.

On top of this, they had to pay extra for everything else — fuel, food and drink. This could come to more than £60,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They were spending a lot and expected a lot in return.'</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Emma, who has written a book about her experience called Casting Off, adds: 'I remember some guests wanting ice-cream milkshakes for their daughter's breakfast.

A former crewman, 40, from London, who wants to remain anonymous, experienced this first hand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2007, while working as a steward on a superyacht owned by a Spanish billionaire, he says: 'We'd arrive at a port and there would be prostitutes waiting. All the female crew were picked for their attractiveness and often felt they were sexually harassed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If this were happening in Britain, it would not be tolerated. It's like modern-day slavery.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The main problem concerning crew protection is that superyachts are registered in FOC states — and what happens on board falls within the registered country's jurisdiction.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, the Burrasca, where Will Black was working, was registered to St Vincent and the Grenadines.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The superyachts are often operating in international waters, and run by management companies on behalf of often unidentifiable owners. The International Transport Workers' Federation says FOC arrangements mean ship-owners can circumnavigate the labour laws of Britain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We believe there should be a genuine link between the real owner of a vessel and the flag the vessel flies. FOC registries make it more difficult to hold ship-owners to account,' a spokesman said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This ambiguity means there are regular instances of staff wages not being paid or of them being suddenly dismissed and left stranded overseas.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Will Black's sister Rosanna, an events organiser, says many of these FOC states are reluctant to investigate wrongdoing for fear of superyacht owners registering elsewhere, losing them millions in registration and annual inspection fees. Will's family want this changed so there is just one body governing what happens onboard.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fiona Hanlon, 50, is another mother whose world was torn apart following the death of her son, Michael, 22, who worked as a water sports manager as part of a crew of 18 on the £65 million 203 ft Faith superyacht, owned by the Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like the Blacks, she feels there has been a lack of care and is fighting to improve crew rights.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Michael, who had worked on Faith for just three weeks, died in April 2013 after arriving in the French port of Antibes from the Caribbean. Michael had returned to the vessel after a night out. His mother claims he had done two shifts back to back, then gone to local bars to celebrate sailing across the Atlantic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Faith had been locked up for the night, and Fiona says Michael climbed up the boat to reach an emergency access door in the roof. The yacht's owner, however, says no such access existed and denied he had been working excessive hours.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An inquest found he fell from the top deck, hit his head on the quay and drowned. His body was recovered the next day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fiona, a former teacher, says: 'Michael had grown up sailing near our home in Windermere in the Lake District. This job was his dream come true. I loved hearing about how he had been swimming with dolphins or going on night dives, it was magical for him.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Michael would text his mother each day with updates, including, she says, how tired he was becoming.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The last time they spoke was when he told her he was going to meet some friends in Antibes but when she failed to hear from him the next day, she became worried.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She then received a call saying he was missing. 'I felt like his disappearance was an inconvenience to the stewardess who called me.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The next day, she received the devastating news Michael's body had been found under the yacht.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'All I could do was lie on the floor and cry,' she recalls</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the inquest in 2015, it was ruled Michael had died from drowning and a verdict of accidental death was recorded.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, so concerned was Cumbrian coroner Philip Sharp by the evidence he heard, he wrote a letter of recommendations to the yacht's owner and other maritime agencies about potential future procedural changes to ensure crew are not required to work excessive hours and have access to the boat at all times.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jonathan Dudman, a spokesman for Lawrence Stroll, said Michael's death had nothing to do with him being overworked — strongly disputing his claim he had worked two night shifts back to back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He highlighted how French police said Michael had been drinking heavily, and that there was an access code to get in the door, which Michael must have forgotten. However, the coroner disagreed with the French authorities' verdict that Michael's judgment had been affected by alcohol.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In addition, he said they had paid for Michael's family to go to Antibes after his death, saying: 'We were very sorry for his mother. It was tragic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There's an issue that Mrs Hanlon said there was an unofficial emergency entrance on the boat. There was no emergency entrance. It did not exist.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This death was an absolute tragedy. It was not the result of the crew being overworked.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sydney Sweibel, a lawyer for Mr Stroll, said: 'Mr Stroll was very sympathetic to the family and did the best he could.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, the owners of the boats Will and Jacob worked on have not have responded to requests as to what happened.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For now, their families have joined forces to work on improving rights for crew. As Rosanna says: 'These boats are a law unto themselves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If someone dies, they can just raise the anchor and leave. This is unacceptable.'</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>While billionaire bosses and their guests enjoy suites on superyachts, beneath all the opulence exists a darker world.

Spade, a mother-of-one, was found hanged with a scarf in the bedroom of her Park Avenue apartment not long after 10am. Meanwhile, Scott was also found hanged with a scarf in her Chelsea home back in March 2014.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Emily Crane</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T00:39:49.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Kate Spade's suicide bears a sad similarity to death of L'Wren Scott</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T00:39:49.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>New York</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5808813/Kate-Spade-dead-Park-Avenue-apartment-apparent-suicide.html" title="Kate Spade killed herself 'after her husband demanded a divorce and moved out' as her sister says she suffered from manic depression for years and was obsessed with Robin Williams' suicide"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5808871/How-Kate-Spade-created-2-4billion-fashion-empire-lost-billions-cashing-early.html" title="Kate Spade dead at 55: How designer created a $2.4billion fashion empire with her husband but lost out on billions by cashing out early and spent her final years trying to launch a second brand which never matched up"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5809377/Kenneth-Cole-deletes-tone-deaf-tweet-calling-Kate-Spade-inspiring-accessory.html" title="'She alone didn't change the handbag world': Shoe designer Kenneth Cole deletes tone deaf tweet calling Kate Spade an 'inspiring accessory' after her shock suicide"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5809439/Kate-Spade-appeared-happy-content-one-final-interviews.html" title="Kate Spade appeared happy and content in one of her final interviews as she laughed alongside her husband Andy about their fashion empire and raising their teen daughter "></link></item></channel></rss>
