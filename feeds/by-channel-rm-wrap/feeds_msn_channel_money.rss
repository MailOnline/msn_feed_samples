</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here is a short summary of the taxes you face when purchasing a property in the UK.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">1) PROPERTY TRANSFER TAXES</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Usually known as stamp duty (SDLT in England and Northern Ireland, LBTT in Scotland and LTT in Wales).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When a property is transferred from one person to another, stamp duty will be payable by the purchaser. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rate changes depending on whether it is freehold or leasehold, whether it is commercial or residential and what country it is in.</p><img id="i-dcc800f961ea249d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/04C69A91000007D0-5812499-image-a-48_1528291414630.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Stamp duty: When a property is transferred from one person to another, stamp duty will be payable" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rates of SDLT on residential properties range from 2 per cent to 15 per cent and can include a surcharge for second homes – this is often cited as one of the reasons for the decline in buy to let properties.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">2) INHERITANCE TAX</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The significant increase in property prices has brought many more owners into the inheritance tax net. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When a property is passed down, most typically following a death, Inheritance Tax is incurred. This will usually be payable on the second death (as most estates are left to the surviving spouse). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">George Osborne introduced an additional tax allowance for family homes when he was chancellor but this operates in a complex way and is not always available.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">3) VAT</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although VAT is not generally payable on purchases of residential property, home improvements are subject to VAT in the vast majority of cases. Major improvements such as loft extensions or adding on rooms will incur a significant VAT charge as the builder will have to add on 20 per cent to his costs.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">4) CAPITAL GAINS TAX</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your main home is often exempt from capital gains tax, but second homes and holiday homes are not. For many years non-residents did not pay capital gains tax: this has changed and residential property gains are subject to this tax. The Government has announced that it plans to increase this tax to all types of UK property from 2019.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">5) ANNUAL TAX ON ENVELOPED DWELLINGS </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">For many years the UK was a very benign place for foreign investment in property and it was relatively simple for non-residents to legally avoid tax. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the ways this was achieved was to hold property via a company often registered outside the UK. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This has changed: residential properties valued at more than £500,000 and which are not owned by individuals, for example properties owned by companies (either UK resident or non-UK resident), can be charged ATED. </p><img id="i-65af6411274f6ed4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/0566C1B5000003E8-5812499-image-a-50_1528291579898.jpg" height="500" width="634" alt="Times change: For many years the UK was a very benign place for foreign investment in property and it was relatively simple for non-residents to legally avoid tax" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">ATED is charged at an annual amount at progressive rates determined by the property value. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are a number of exemptions for this, such as property rental businesses. Where an actual charge to the ATED arises, higher rates of capital gains tax can apply to gains arising on the disposal of the property.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">6) COUNCIL TAX/BUSINESS RATES</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Depending on where you live in the UK, your home is subject to council tax. Although the tax is used by local authorities to raise funds to meet the cost of local services in the area for which they have responsibility, it is nonetheless charged on the value of property. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the case of commercial property, this is implemented through a charge to business rates which is calculated by reference to the value of the property and a multiplier determined by the size of the business.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All of the above taxes apply to properties which are owner occupied. If you receive rent for your property, there are additional taxes to consider.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">7) INCOME TAX</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you let your property you need to consider income tax, this applies to both residents and non-residents. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are a non-UK resident, individual or company renting in the UK, you are subject to UK income tax on the profits of your trade/property rental business. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The loan interest deduction rules for buy to let investors are changing - the effect will be that in some cases owners will pay tax on ‘income for tax purposes’ that is greater than their real income.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">8) CORPORATION TAX</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">UK resident companies are chargeable to UK corporation tax on the profits of their property trade/property rental business. </p><img id="i-af08a320732ce5b6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/4CF98D0B00000578-5812499-image-a-2_1528292064305.jpg" height="460" width="306" alt="Paul Falvey is a tax partner at accountancy and business advisory firm BDO LLP" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">This law is expected to change to include non-UK resident companies letting UK property from April 2020. Currently, non-UK companies pay income tax on their rent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Property ownership is highly taxed; this is not surprising given that property is easy to identify, difficult to hide and most often very valuable. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Property investors sometimes overlook the amount of tax they will pay over their lifetime (or sometimes beyond) of their ownership of property. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even your main home is not completely tax free as you will almost certainly have paid stamp duty, will incur VAT on home improvements and maintenance and your heirs could also pay inheritance tax.<span class="mol-style-italic"> </span></p><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Paul Falvey, a tax partner at accountancy and business advisory firm BDO LLP, says most people who are looking to purchase a property are aware that they may have to pay stamp duty but, whether you’re buying your first house, a commercial property or a holiday home, there are many more taxes to consider.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our own miniature grand tour on winding Italian roads proved to be a rather fun, entertaining and quite leisurely cruise, before we both rather nervously returned for a blood-and-guts drive around Ferrari’s famous Fiorano race-track test circuit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is the track opposite the firm’s factory in Maranello, in northern Italy, where all civilian and F1 cars are put through their paces.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And this would be after hours of dilly-dallying in a car starting at a cool £250,000 that will sprint to 62mph in under three seconds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So we got a move on. Sort of.

Engaging Mr May – the ‘nice one’ of the Top Gear trio - is already the owner- after much self-confessed wavering – of a £250,000 limited edition Ferrari 458 Speciale.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He secured the very last one. Or rather Ferrari built an extra one for him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He bought it just as what he calls the infamous ‘punchgate’ affair led to the canning of their much-loved  version of the BBC Top Gear programme, after Clarkson got into an altercation with a producer over a steak dinner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So May sold a few motor bikes at auction to help keep his finances in balance, before Amazon Prime waved some large cheques in the trio’s direction to recreate their on-screen chemistry with the lavishly filmed Grand Tour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now he is pondering whether to trade in his 458 Speciale, which is growing in value as a collectors’ car, for the new and improved 488 Pista.</p><img id="i-cfda1a244288a9d7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/13/4CF83D6400000578-5811977-image-a-8_1528286932331.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="His nickname from fellow presenters Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond is Captain Slow, but James May is not really a slouch behind the wheel, says Ray Massey" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Pista is not a limited edition, though bosses told me the first two years’ production run of around 2,000 cars is already sold out to largely long-standing Ferrari customers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would be ungentlemanly and churlish to apportion any blame for our tardy progress.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This involved a fair bit of faffing about, including: looking for a licensed tobacco shops for my chain-smoking companion, stopping for a well-earned coffee in a rather cool motor bike themed café, shooting the breeze about life and everything from Lego to Zeppelins, and getting ‘lost’ down some beautiful if diverting Italian country lanes when the sat-nav threw a bit off a wobbly and took us ‘off pista’.</p><img id="i-c6044bff5f48f7f5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/13/4CF83CFA00000578-5811977-image-a-9_1528286940002.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The 488 Pista is pretty phenomenal to drive, says Ray, especially for a self-confessed ‘ordinary driver' for whom it makes light work of piloting a supercar" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stopping en route for that espresso at a roadside bikers’ café, we parked next to a tiny but similarly red liveried Piaggio mini-van and caused a mini-sensation. Italians male and female of every age and shape busied around the Ferrari, debating the 488 Pista’s finer points, taking photographs and engaging in heated debate as we looked on. Such passion. About a car.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ferrari is at pains to point out that this phenomenally high performance car with racing pedigree is designed to be as easy and fulfilling to drive on the road by ‘drivers of all types', whether race-track pros or high net-worth petrolheads.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And you will need deep pockets, of course. The price for a 488 Pista starts at £252,765 before you add any of the potentially very expensive extras. That includes £2,112 for the four-point harness, £8,640 for the go faster racing stripe, and £14,208 for the carbon-fibre wheels alone.</p><img id="i-d66f90f8950e0f73" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/13/4CF83C9500000578-5811977-image-a-10_1528286952349.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The new supercar’s Pista name means track and Ferrari claims it can be both a racer out there and civilised for the road" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new supercar’s Pista name may not translate so well into English from the Italian, but simply means track. When you arrive at the circuit you see above you in giant letters alongside a prancing horse on a Ferrari red banner the words Pista di Fiorano.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what’s it actually like to drive? Pretty phenomenal, as you might expect. Especially for a self-confessed ‘ordinary driver' for whom it makes light work of piloting a supercar.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ferrari say the new 488 Pista builds and improves upon the earlier 488 GTB iteration and the previous 458 Speciale model, and is lighter, faster and more ‘extreme’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is powered by a mighty 4.0 litre (3,902cc) V8 engine developing 720 horsepower linked to a slick 7-speed dual clutch automatic gearbox with manual override, via paddles on the steering wheel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It accelerates at blistering speed from rest to 0-62mph in just 2.85 seconds – and up to 124mph in just 7.6 seconds – reaching a potential top speed of 211mph. The vitally powerful brakes will bring you to a complete stop from 62mph in 29.6 metres.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some comfort elements have been stripped out – such as the glovebox – in favour of open cubby holes.</p><img id="i-5c66ef233ac5336c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/4CF837C200000578-5811977-Aerodynamic_tweaks_mean_the_Ferrari_488_Pista_also_has_up_to_20_-a-1_1528291480452.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Aerodynamic tweaks mean the  Ferrari 488 Pista also has up to 20% more ‘downforce’ to help keep it rooted to the tarmac" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ferrari says the 488 Pista has the highest amount of transfer of racing tech to one of its roadgoing cars.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s 90kg lighter, about the weight of a man, than its predecessor 488 GTB, and has 50 more horsepower (and 115hp more than my driving companion’s 458 Speciale).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It also has 50 per cent more new parts in the improved engine and virtually no turbo-lag when you floor the throttle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aerodynamic tweaks mean the Pista also has up to 20 per cent more downforce to help keep it rooted to the tarmac. This is helped by a clever S-Duct used for the first time on a road-going car. It’s basically a gap behind the front bumper that forces air between the bumper and the bonnet and then over the front windscreen, boosting downforce over the front axle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are sharper gear-shifts and lashings of lightweight carbon-fibre in the functional racing-style interior.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It still had room for my hefty laptop bag in the under-the-bonnet ‘boot’. And there’s that satisfying Ferrari roar, which has been further tuned and enhanced, when you open her up.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS money" data-version="2" id="mol-de3afa10-6974-11e8-b588-eff387529d1d">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Ferrari 488 Pista </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Price: £252,765</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">First deliveries: September 2018</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">First two years’ production sold out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Top speed: 211mph</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Acceleration:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">0-62mph: 2.85 seconds</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">0-124mph: 7.6 seconds</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Braking distance: 62mph to 0 mph: 29.6m</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Engine: 3,902cc V8 twin-tubo</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Power: 720 horsepower (CV)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Length: 4,605mm</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Width: 1,975mm</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Height: 1,206mm</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kerb weight: 1,385kg</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Transmission: F1 7-speed dual clutch gearbox.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Three-and-a-half years on, David, now 76, says those claims have come back to haunt him. For every year since the panels were installed, he's been left more than £500 out of pocket. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He knows this because he set up a dedicated bank account to track all the costs and savings from his solar panels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, David's investment has gone so badly that it is part of the reason he and Joan have had to sell their house and downsize to one on a cheaper estate. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even after refinancing with another bank, they have been left paying £143 a month towards the £8,000 they still owe for solar panels they can no longer use.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Before getting the solar panels, we would arrange to go out for a nice meal once a month and go on self-catering holidays to Suffolk — but we can't afford luxuries now,' says David.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The couple are among thousands of people who were sold loans to install solar panels on their roofs, only to find that steep costs have outweighed any financial benefit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over the past two weeks, Money Mail has received 80 complaints from homeowners who feel they were misled by greedy salesmen who made the deals sound like one-way bets.</p><img id="i-556c917922556f56" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/21/4CF27D4C00000578-0-image-a-2_1528229448067.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Complaint: Richard Beeley’s home faces east, so gets less sun, making the solar panel less effective" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their tales are remarkably similar to David's, in that they all claim to have been left out of pocket every year by the loan repayments, even after their bill savings are taken into account.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, around 2,000 people have complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service in the past year alone. Estimates suggest the total number hit by the scandal could be as high as 20,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Three-quarters of last year's complaints were about loans with three lenders: Barclays Partner Finance (part of Barclays Bank); Shawbrook Bank; and Creation Consumer Finance (part of French bank BNP Paribas).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Solar companies know that most people can't afford the average cost of £7,000 to £9,000 for each panel. So they have gone door-to-door offering loans to fund the projects.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The most common type of panels are photovoltaic (PV) ones, which convert sunlight into electricity and should last 25 years. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You get free electricity when the sun is out and any surplus generated is sold back to your energy supplier at a 'feed-in' tariff set by the Government.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Homeowners are told the savings on offer mean that the panels pay for themselves. But, as David found out, this isn't always the case.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says his monthly loan repayments were £124, or £1,488 a year. He saved more on his energy bills in the summer, rather than the winter, months, but he says this evened out at around £480 each year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His quarterly tariff payments from the Government fluctuated, too, depending on the season, but usually earned him around £490 a year. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Between January and March, David would receive £80; between April and June, this would rise to almost £200; between July and September, it would dip to £160; before going down to just £50 between October and December.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Overall, David claims that he was around £518 a year worse off after installing the solar panels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another reader, Andrew Rowley, says: 'I would say I am probably about £400 to £500 a year out of pocket from this, despite the fact the salesperson told us that, after the first year, the panels would pay for themselves and more.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many, such as David Powter-Robinson, emailed to say they have put in a formal complaint after feeling pressured into accepting loans.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Ombudsman says it has found 'evidence of pressure sales techniques and misleading sales literature or representations by the salesperson'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On top of this, many victims were 'retired or approaching retirement', it says. Experts say large, long-term loans are usually unwise for this age group. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although the sales were made by solar companies, consumer credit law states the lender behind deals must take responsibility if something goes wrong. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Ombudsman has found against lenders in a number of cases. In one instance, it heard that a customer named only as Mr K was told he'd save around £25,000 over the next 20 years. But the finance agreement was for £40,000 over ten years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Ombudsman said: 'This clearly didn't make financial sense — and we didn't think Mr K would have gone ahead if the full costs had been explained to him.' It says it had no reason to doubt Mr K's version of events.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has now forced the lender to issue a new interest-free loan for the solar panels only, which significantly reduced the monthly costs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In David's case, his lender is Creation Consumer Finance, which is owned by BNP Paribas. He says when he voiced concerns to the My Planet salesman, he was offered a £1,000 cheque to sign on the spot.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I was worried about being locked into a ten-year loan at my age,' says David. 'What if something happened to me? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'My wife is a retired hairdresser and gets less than £100 a week from her state pension, so it felt risky.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The salesman kept repeating that: 'It doesn't cost you anything, this will save you money and the whole scheme is backed by the Government.' Unfortunately, we trusted him.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During the 14-day cooling-off period, David lost confidence in the scheme and rang to cancel. Instead, the man in the pinstripe suit was sent round to put him at ease. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'By then, my brain was addled by all the numbers and percentages he was telling me,' says David.</p><img id="i-342235981cee5aa0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/22/4CF3B6C500000578-5809673-image-a-11_1528232916614.jpg" height="414" width="634" alt="Valerie and Patrick Jennings were cold-called by energy firm Clean Green in October 2015 and later visited by a sales agent " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I came away thinking solar panels and renewable energy are for the greater good, so as long as I'm not out of pocket, I'll do my bit for the environment and save some money while I'm at it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokeswoman for Creation Consumer Finance owner BNP Paribas says that its deals were 'fully compliant with Consumer Credit Act regulations'. 'Creation Finance was not involved in the selling process — which is the subject of these complaints,' adds the spokeswoman.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'BNP Paribas is committed to working with the Ombudsman to resolve any outstanding issues and is determined to ensure that these matters are dealt with swiftly and fairly.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Patrick and Valerie Jennings say they had a similar experience.

And it is also correct that once you lock into a rate, you get that for life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Virginia Graham, who runs the Renewable Energy Consumer Code (RECC) and sets consumer standards for solar panel companies, says the threat of tariff change has routinely been exploited by 'disreputable' solar salesmen to push deals on people who shouldn't be signing at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Valerie asked for the rate of interest on the loan, she says she was left thinking it was 0.79 per cent a year. In fact, the rate was 0.79 per cent a month — or 9.5 per cent a year. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That meant they faced paying back £4,971 interest on top of the £8,995 they borrowed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It wasn't until April 2017, when Patrick and Valerie looked at their bills, that they realised that, despite paying £116 a month, very little of the capital was being cleared.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The interest was astronomical and we were barely chipping away at the overall debt. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If we'd realised what rate we were signing up to, we'd never have taken it on,' says Valerie. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We could have read the small print more carefully, but the whole deal was rushed through and they were so forceful that we were a bit flummoxed.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Jennings managed to pay off the balance using their savings, but were left relying on credit cards for day-to-day spending.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We're the type of people who only spend what we have — we don't overextend ourselves and hate living beyond our means — so it's rather galling,' says Valerie.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Richard Beeley, 70, says he feels foolish after being talked into buying solar panels in 2014. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A representative from a firm called iPower told him a solar panel system on his two-bedroom end-of-terrace would pay for itself within three years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But now, Richard believes this projection was unrealistic — partly as his Rotherham home faces east and so generates less power than one facing south.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We felt we'd be benefitting the environment, but no one spoke to us about the specifics of our home and that it is poorly positioned,' says Richard.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He pays £130 a month in loan repayments. In summer months, his £120 electricity bill is halved thanks to the panels, saving him around £60. In winter, his bill is only reduced by £10 a month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, on average, he saves £25 a month, but spends £130, making it a costly investment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Richard and his wife Denise, 68, feel they weren't given the full 14-day cooling-off period because their panels were installed 12 days after they signed up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They complained about the mis-selling to Creation Consumer Finance — the same firm behind David and Joan Rowe's loan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The couple have received a 25 per cent discount on their repayments.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They wouldn't actually admit any fault — but giving us a reduction as a gesture of goodwill says everything,' says Richard.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman from industry trade body the Solar Trade Association says: 'We condemn any sales techniques that overstate the benefits of solar panels to the consumer, as appears to be the situation with these cases.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We recommend all potential solar consumers always use an installer that is a member of a registered consumer code, such as the Renewable Energy Consumer Code (RECC) or Home Insulation &amp; Energy Systems Contractors Scheme (HIES).'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman for Barclays Partner Finance says: 'We are committed to delivering positive outcomes for our customers and apologise to those who feel they have had reason to complain. We work hard to resolve complaints and these are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All of the solar panel sales companies named in this article have since shut down and could not be contacted for comment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">s.smyth@dailymail.co.uk</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Joan and David Rowe, from Upminster, Essex, fell victim to a door-to-door solar panel salesman who signed them up for a £14,000 loan claiming they would be better off.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Money Mail understands that the criminals were using the 82 accounts, among others, to scam shoppers on websites such as eBay. It is feared that this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A police investigation into gangs operating similar scams to the one linked to the accounts has uncovered more than 5,000 victims with losses up to £15 million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Typically, the fraudsters listed non-existent items such as cars or tractors at attractive prices.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They would then lure customers into making a payment but never deliver any goods. With this type of scam, buyers are often told to send the money directly by making a bank transfer. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then, as soon as the money arrives in the crook's account, it is moved on through a series of other accounts so it cannot be traced.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This typically means buyers are not covered by the money-back guarantees offered by websites.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, unlike fraud cases where a debit or credit card is used, banks also typically refuse to cover the losses.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a result, it is unlikely that much of the £15 million has been returned to victims.</p><img id="i-f79dcd929bd35b0f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/21/056014D1000007D0-0-image-a-2_1528230138508.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="A police investigation into gangs operating similar scams to the one linked to the accounts has uncovered more than 5,000 victims with losses up to £15 million" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The nine banks implicated in the police list obtained by Money Mail refuse to say how much cash they have reimbursed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, they say only in rare cases were they able to freeze some of the funds that remained in the fraudulent accounts. This money has been returned to its rightful owners, they say.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nearly all the accounts are now understood to have been shut down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last year, 43,875 people lost an average of £2,784 each to online bank transfer scams.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But just £1 in every £4 was returned to customers. Money Mail's Pay Back Fraud Victims campaign has called on banks either to track down stolen funds or to cover the losses themselves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Experts say where banks are found to have allowed crooks to open accounts using fake IDs, they should be forced to take responsibility for any losses suffered by customers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Money Mail has handed the list of 82 accounts to the City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority, which says it will contact all the banks involved.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Arun Chauhan, director of Tenet Compliance &amp; Litigation, a law firm that provides advice on financial crime compliance, says: 'These banks have allowed organised criminal gangs to abuse their systems and steal from thousands of victims. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There are more than 80 accounts on this list and half of them are HSBC, which is extremely worrying.'</p><img id="i-1f93ff2dc6d7232" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/21/15FC7DD400000514-0-image-a-4_1528230310940.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Almost half of the accounts were opened at HSBC, which has previously been fined almost $2 billion in the U.S. for allowing Mexican drug kingpins to launder money" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Banks are supposed to follow strict rules when opening a new account for a customer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Under money laundering regulations, they must carry out so-called customer due diligence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to the rules, this includes verifying a customer's identity using documents, data or information obtained from a reliable and independent source.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is why your bank usually asks you to provide photo ID and proof of address before it will open any account. However, fraudsters are routinely getting around these checks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Metropolitan Police has launched an investigation called Operation Arad to track down fraudsters who go on to scam online shoppers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 82 accounts on the list obtained by Money Mail were uncovered as part of this operation. All were found to have been opened using fake IDs and documents.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The police are understood to have charged 62 people linked to the wider investigation and more accounts are expected to come under scrutiny.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eight people connected to the 82 accounts have already been jailed for their part in the scam. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Money Mail asked all nine banks how criminals were able to use counterfeit documents to get past their security. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We also asked whether they would take responsibility for the losses that victims suffered as a result.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">None admit responsibility for allowing fraudsters to open and operate accounts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">HSBC refuses to say how many payments the criminals received, how much they stole, if there was any money left, whether victims were reimbursed, or if the fraudulent accounts had been closed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman says the bank 'worked hard' to 'identify and address the ever-changing techniques used by fraudsters' and continually reviews its checks and processes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nationwide says it followed industry guidelines and staff are trained to spot ID documents that are obviously fake. But it admits it's harder to identify the most sophisticated counterfeits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The other banks refused to answer specific questions about the accounts but claimed they followed 'strict' industry regulations and were confident that their security systems were robust.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They all said they take fraud extremely seriously.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Barclays says it could not identify one of the accounts on the list. It says there was no indication that the accounts would be used for fraud either.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Metro Bank and Nat West declined to comment on the accounts in question and say they are doing all they can to combat increasingly sophisticated scams.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Santander would not comment on the accounts in question, but says it invests 'heavily in sophisticated technology' to prevent fraud.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">TSB says it was able to spot its one fraudulent account and close it 'very quickly'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman for Lloyds and its sister bank Halifax says the banks always abide by 'strict regulations when opening an account for a new customer'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Buster Jack', a former financial adviser in his 60s who uses an alias because he runs a business assisting scam victims by catching out crooks, says: 'The banks accepted false documents and opened the accounts, surely that's a breach of regulations? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The police are focusing on catching criminals, but who's investigating the banks?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">UK Finance, the industry trade body, says that banks work closely with the Government and police to identify fraudulent documents and it is developing new ID guidelines which will be published next year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">amelia.murray@dailymail.co.uk</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The list, which was compiled by police as part of an investigation into online fraud, shows that the crooks managed to trick nine major High Street banks into letting them run accounts to carry out scams.

But then I notice Nigel's phone is now perched on top of my purse.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nigel skims cards at dinner parties to show just how easy it is for criminals to steal payment details and use them to make fraudulent purchases online.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says: 'It's a bit of a gimmick of mine. You hold up the phone to a guest's pocket and say: 'Ah, you have a Mastercard. Your expiry date is this, your number is this.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's shocking for people who assume their details are protected — and seeing it happen in real time makes them realise how vulnerable they are to fraud.'</p><img id="i-f36bf794fff162ab" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/21/4CEF833700000578-5809745-image-a-4_1528230776998.jpg" height="488" width="306" alt="The app that is completely legal and costs just £5., is called the Credit Card Reader NFC " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nigel has a vested interest — he's an entrepreneur and owns the European rights to Australian product, SkimGuard, which you put in your wallet to block fraudsters from stealing your details. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That's why Money Mail wanted to see for itself how easy card-skimming really is.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I lean across the table to get a good look at the phone but Nigel has one more trick up his sleeve. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He taps the screen, selects a 'transactions' option and shows me — to my horror — the last ten purchases I made using that card. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All my recent spending is there, the Tube journeys to and from work, the groceries for a dinner party and flights I'd booked for an upcoming holiday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's impossible to get this level of detail on debit or Amex cards, Nigel explains. But many credit cards are ripe for fraud. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is because the chips inside cards issued by some banks hold previous transaction details. Not all cards are vulnerable, though. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Banks tell customers that spending on stolen contactless cards by crooks is kept in check because each transaction is limited to £30 at most. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They say your PIN is automatically demanded after a set number of suspicious-looking payments. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But experts say the real danger is not losing money in a contactless transaction after someone brushes past your handbag with a card reader, but the crook harvesting all the card details they need to commit fraud in your name.</p><img id="i-290ff1224054edae" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/21/4CEF83B100000578-5809745-image-a-1_1528230738176.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Some sites do not require a three-digit CVV number  to make a purchase.

</div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chief among these was Old Mutual Smaller Companies Focus, a fund I picked up several years ago. This does what it says on the box, investing primarily in a limited number of small UK companies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was the best-performing UK investment fund last year, turning every £1,000 invested into £1,507, according to figures covering all funds published in the specialist magazine Money Management.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not surprisingly, from humble beginnings, it has become one of my larger holdings. Like all managed funds it has its shaky periods. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But analysis website FE Trustnet still shows it has doubled my money over three years and increased it by a whopping 180 per cent in five years — turning £1,000 into £2,800.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">It should have been renamed the Modest Ideas fund </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">But then there was the same fund manager's Global Best Ideas fund which might be better renamed Modest Ideas.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">FE Trustnet figures show it has provided a return of around 48 per cent over five years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Compared with what I might have got in a savings account that's a terrific return.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But weighing it against the Investment Association's Global index, which tells us how a typical basket of shares in major companies around the world might have grown over that period, tells a different story. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just tracking this I would have made 62 per cent. The obvious question was why am I paying a fund manager when a robot has done a better job and more cheaply? So I sold it.</p><img id="i-8133981f81dadff6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/21/0C62DC11000005DC-5809781-image-a-4_1528231435160.jpg" height="372" width="634" alt="Old Mutual Smaller Companies Focus was the best-performing UK investment fund last year, turning every £1,000 invested into £1,507" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I stared at the name Man GLG Balanced Managed. What was this and how had it crept into my portfolio? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Had Amazon Alexa been playing tricks on me again?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A quick chat with Mark Dampier, a funds guru at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, sparked illumination. GLG had run a technology fund which had been buried into this. Might I have bought that?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Well, yes. What I couldn't explain was why a fund manager would think technology investors would want to head into a stodgy balanced managed fund.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here's a lesson for all of us. When we get letters telling us of fund mergers we really must act on them. Clearly, my attention was elsewhere at the time when I was informed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another one bites the dust.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-f713b3b0-696f-11e8-b588-eff387529d1d">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox">More to the point, it had delivered me practically no profits over the past five years </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">More needed to go. I'd plumped for a fund called Jupiter New Europe (Offshore), several years ago in a fit of excitement about the prospects for emerging East Europe markets. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the fund is dominated by investments in Russia (around 50 per cent of its holdings) with Turkey around 15 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At one time that may have been fine, but I am no longer comfortable with it. More to the point, it had delivered me practically no profits over the past five years. I sold it at a tad above the price at which I bought it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What of Jupiter Absolute Return — a fund that for me has delivered an absolutely ghastly return? This fund gave the manager freedom to do more or less what he wanted, and it looked as though he proceeded to do nothing at all after the 2008 banking crisis.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">There's been a change of manager but it remains very defensive, returning just 16 per cent in five years. Absolutely no point in keeping it, so I sold.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Threadneedle UK Equity Alpha also bit the dust. The previous manager, who had done a great job, retired. The new incumbent's performance is so-so.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My mission to clear out funds that have disappointed or are no longer appropriate is well underway. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So far I have sold 11. But I also want to construct a more rewarding portfolio going ahead.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-eec340e0-696f-11e8-b588-eff387529d1d">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox">If you are going to invest your money in active funds then you need to be active in monitoring changes and developments </div>                        <div class="mol-article-quote-attribution"><div>Mark Dampier </div></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ringing in my ears is a message from Mr Dampier that all investors in active funds should heed: 'If you are going to invest your money in active funds then you need to be active in monitoring changes and developments.

As our report on page 36 shows, almost every bank has been guilty of a dereliction of duty by allowing crooks to open 82 accounts using fake IDs.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thanks to the police documents seen by Money Mail reporter Amelia Murray, which are thought to be the tip of the iceberg, we can for the first time reveal this is happening on a frightening scale.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So much for banks’ rigorous controls which are supposed to prevent money-laundering.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why is it you need a seemingly endless series of ID to open a basic savings account at a bank where you’ve been a customer for decades, yet someone can so easily open one in a fake name?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If banks were doing their jobs in the first place, the fraudsters would find it far harder to carry out the devious online scams they use to rob people of their savings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our sources say the documents that were used to open the 82 accounts in question were incredibly realistic. And, privately, banks say they find it almost impossible spot good fakes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s their fault if a criminal is abusing their systems, not ours.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It does not entitle them to wash their hands of all responsibility when customers lose their cash.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Branch lines</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Talking of deceptions, how about the weasel words banks are using to close local branches and force us all online?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As the Mail revealed on Saturday, they are downplaying the number of customers who use branches and then using that as an excuse to shut them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To be classed as a ‘regular weekly user’ at Lloyds, you need to visit 48 weeks out of 52 every year. That means if you go on holiday in the summer and don’t pop in over Christmas and Easter you can be excluded from the calculations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For RBS-NatWest, the figure is 23 weeks out of the past 26.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Both companies say they take into account dozens of factors when shutting branches. But the ‘too few customers’ excuse always seems to be plastered on the signs announcing a closure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How many would still be open if banks used a more realistic way of judging the number of regular customers they have?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We need an industry-wide standard that banks must adhere to that sets out the criteria for a branch closure. It should include total customers registered with a branch, numbers who visit on average every day, a breakdown of transactions and opening hours.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then we’ll have the truth on the great branch closure cover-up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Funeral scandal</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After Money Mail exposed the shameful tactics that some firms use to flog funeral plans, the Treasury has launched a crackdown. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As we revealed in April, it wants to put the Financial Conduct Authority in charge of regulating the market over fears that the elderly are being harassed into taking out plans that will leave their families out of pocket.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The only way to ensure that justice is done is to provide the Government with evidence of what’s going on. John Glen, the economic secretary to the Treasury, has asked Money Mail to compile as many stories from our readers as possible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It can be hard to talk about the death of a family member but if you’ve found that the plan they bought has left you out of pocket, let us know.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">In April</span><span class="mol-style-italic">, I passed out twice in a Benidorm hotel, where staff called a private doctor who got me admitted to hospital. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Not only did we have to pay the doctor, but my husband had to pay the hospital €2,000 for me to be let out to fly home. They are also demanding a further unspecified bill of €2,500.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">I have a European health card and insurance from easyJet/Zurich. But the insurers say I have to pay because of pre-existing medical conditions. The cardiologist in Spain discovered I have an irregular heartbeat, which caused the blackouts. I have never suffered with this before.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">We can ill afford what we have had to pay, let alone further costs to come.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>G. H., Gwent.</strong></p><img id="i-3752f607b41b3bd3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/21/4CF05C4000000578-0-image-a-3_1528232041215.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="One reader who suffered health problems on a Spanish holiday was saddled with a huge bill despite taking out insurance " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">You were initially caught out by Spanish medics whisking you to a private, rather than a state, hospital. Then an intermediary handling the claim made a right old mess.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Zurich, the insurer that underwrites your policy, says your claim was valid, as your fainting had nothing to do with any pre-existing condition. The hospital misled you on this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You contacted the insurance assistance team at 9.59 and they replied at 10.54 asking for details and the likely discharge date. Costs at that point were estimated at €2,500 by the hospital.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The assistance team spoke with you that afternoon and ran through the questionnaire, when you were told that you might not be covered if your claim was related to an existing condition.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The assistance team contacted the hospital the following day, however you had already been discharged and given a Fit To Fly certificate by a doctor.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You called to discuss your claim again on April 16. Zurich has listened to the call and, when you said you had paid the hospital, an agent shrieked: ‘Why did you do that?’ This should not have happened and Zurich has made this clear to the agent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You were asked for receipts and then given an incorrect number to call about your claim. The hospital then appears to have incorrectly told you the claim would not be paid. There was a further delay, and it was not until April 24 that Zurich had a reply from the hospital.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">You then received an email on April 26, which, the agent admits, was ‘a little blunt’. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A further letter contained mistakes, not least being addressed wrongly. After this, Zurich called a senior team meeting to sort things out. Finally, your claim has been sorted out.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">You may not think that the world needs another large £80,000 SUV with sporty aspirations, but Audi certainly does.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The German carmaker today took the wraps off its new flagship Q8 sports utility vehicle at its global launch in China. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And instead of being bigger than the already super-sized Q7, as the model numbering might suggest, this is Audi’s answer to the growing number of top-end 'sporty' off-roaders, including Britain’s Range Rover Sport, BMW’s X6, Mercedes-Benz’s GLE Coupe and the Maserati Levante.</p><img id="i-d5385e7bec027a5e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/15/4CF04E4600000578-0-image-m-59_1528207695905.jpg" height="426" width="634" alt="Audi's new sleek SUV: The Audi Q8 will become the German brand's range-topping 4X4 when it goes on sale in the UK in July" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The almost five metre long and two metre wide Q8, which will cost between £65,000 and £80,000, has been styled for a more coupe-like aerodynamic look - designed to appear much lower than its smaller Q7 sibling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But while it is 66mm shorter it is also 27mm wider with a wheelbase stretching to nearly 3 metres, allowing for more space inside.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">There's been some good news about broadband charges - or at least what I'm hoping will be good news.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/bills/article-5757115/Virgin-Media-overcharged-customers-early-termination-fees-watchdog-says.html">Ofcom has said the exit fees of up to £240 Virgin Media charges customers</a> if they  move  and it doesn't supply their new home, may be too high and may put people off switching.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While this is a small step - Ofcom hasn't actually said what Virgin needs to do to put the situation right - it's a move in the right direction and comes after months of campaigning from us for these fees to be refunded and abolished.</p><img id="i-66713c42fb37fa80" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/11/25A608A800000578-5770951-image-a-1_1527243563055.jpg" height="317" width="634" alt="Ofcom launched a formal investigation last summer into the fairness of its terms and conditions around leaving a contract early" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">After being approached by scores of angry Virgin customers, l<a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/bills/article-4718494/Virgin-Media-charges-hundreds-customers-exit-fees.html">ast year we wrote several stories about the hefty fees</a> being charged when they decided to move  and Virgin wasn't available at their new home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We presented a dossier of these reader accounts to both Virgin Media and Ofcom.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was accompanied by <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/bills/article-4718494/Virgin-Media-charges-hundreds-customers-exit-fees.html">evidence from a lawyer</a> we approached who concluded that if a contract says a consumer has to pay a certain sum of money, whether or not the service provider can easily find another customer to replace them, it is potentially unfair.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Following this,<a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/bills/article-4650702/Virgin-Media-s-early-exit-fees-investigated-Ofcom.html"> Ofcom launched a formal investigation last summer i</a>nto the fairness of Virgin's terms and conditions around leaving a contract early. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has now said, in an update to the investigation, that it has ‘reasonable grounds to believe’ that Virgin contravened rules by setting and charging customers early termination fees which are too high. It also said Virgin failed to publish clear and up-to-date information around the early termination fees on its website. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Virgin now has to respond to the regulator and the final ruling will be published at the end of the summer. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/comment/article-4651222/Virgin-Media-stop-charging-customers-240-home.html">As I said last year</a>, I believe there is no other option but for Ofcom to tell Virgin it needs to refund all of those people who have had to pay an exit fee if they’ve moved home during a contract and Virgin wasn’t available at the new home. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This should not only be the fee, it should also include  interest, which should reflect the highest amount they could have earned if the money was in a savings account.</p><img id="i-fd94aa4d700d458c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/11/05AE8CF7000003E8-5770951-image-a-2_1527243714558.jpg" height="449" width="634" alt="While it's a big cost to the firm, £240 is a lot to a consumer in a time of squeezed incomes" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The fee should also be abolished immediately for those moving house and wanting to take Virgin with them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I also think the fee for exiting the contract - for whatever reason is given - needs to be lowered to something more reasonable. Sky, for example, charge customers a basic service fee for the remainder of their contract if they leave within the fixed-term period. In fact a universal system decided upon by Ofcom for all telecoms providers to calculate the exit fee would be the fairest way to go forward.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not only is the fee unjust when it comes to moving  – it’s not the customer’s fault Virgin doesn’t supply their new home – it’s outrageously high.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Virgin can't lose out on up to £240 every time someone leaves early, especially as there is a good chance whoever moves into the property next may sign up to it and therefore it doesn't really lose out much at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When someone leaves Virgin early and breaks the contract, they are charged a fee depending on how many months of their contract they have left.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This amount depends on how much they're currently paying, but the maximum amount is capped at £240. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Virgin runs on its own fibre network, separate to BT’s Openreach which all the other major providers use. It’s available in around 40 per cent of the UK so the chances of moving to a property where it’s not available are reasonably high.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Therefore it's unlikely to want to pay out compensation lightly, especially as there could be millions of people who have paid these fees in the past.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, while it's a big cost to the firm, £240 is also a lot to a consumer. Virgin should also benefit in the long run as without these extortionate fees customers will be more likely to stay with it for longer or return next time it is available. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is the only ruling I think Ofcom can reasonably take in order to rectify the shoddy behaviour which has been going on for far too long.  </p><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Not only is the fee unjust – it’s not the customer’s fault Virgin doesn’t supply their new home – it’s outrageously high and I believe doesn’t reflect the work the firm has to carry out when someone leaves.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>This Is Money</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Richard Browning</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T13:53:34.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Rebecca Goodman:‘Why is Virgin STILL charging customers £240 to leave’</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T13:53:34.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/comment/article-5768569/ALEX-BRUMMER-Party-poopers-hit-Lloydss-annual-general-meeting.html" title="ALEX BRUMMER: Party poopers hit Lloyds's annual general meeting amid a revolt against boss's pay"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/comment/article-5768493/CITY-DIARY-Lloyds-boss-Antonio-Horta-Osorio-proving-quite-social-butterfly.html" title="CITY DIARY: Lloyd's boss Antonio Horta Osorio is proving quite the social butterfly"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/bills/article-5761763/How-complain-compensation-broadband-blackouts.html" title="Three in four households have at least three broadband breakdowns every month: How you can complain and get compensation for blackouts"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/bills/article-5763163/EE-hikes-prices-second-time-THREE-months.html" title="EE hikes prices for the second time in THREE months and doubles the price of calling Ireland - and it won¿t let you leave without a penalty"></link></item><item><title>How to invest for income: Chasing higher yields is tempting, but can leave you exposed</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/diyinvesting/article-5804289/How-invest-income-chasing-yield.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jun 2018 06:19:14 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5804289</guid><description><![CDATA[In this series we are breaking the subject of income investing down into manageable chunks.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">This worked for many years. You could take the dividends and interest generated from the portfolio and leave the capital untouched, hopefully to grow over time.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Bond yields aren’t what they used to be</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, as shown in Figure 1, the income generated by bonds has fallen steadily over the last 30 years, leaving many of us struggling to obtain our desired income.</p><img id="i-b92b1f6c1373fd80" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/16/4CE8195700000578-0-Figure_1_The_graph_illustrates_the_steady_decline_in_income_from-a-4_1528126299721.jpg" height="346" width="634" alt="Figure 1: The graph illustrates the steady decline in income from bonds" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">To counter this trend of falling yields from high-quality fixed income, many have hunted for higher yields elsewhere. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, like other areas of investing, there’s a link between risk and reward. Higher income can mean you are exposed to higher risk. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So where have investors gone?</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">An increased equity exposure</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many have increased their equity exposure. At the time of writing, the yield on the FTSE 100 is around 4 per cent compared to roughly 1.5 per cent for a 10-year gilt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So for an investor seeking income, increasing the equity weighting may look like a dead cert. In the short-term there’s no doubt their income will rise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, remember what the role of fixed income is in a portfolio. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, it will provide some income, but its main purpose is to act as a buffer against the ups and downs provided by equities. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When shares fall it’s high-quality fixed income that protects the portfolio. High-quality bonds tend to rise in value as equities fall because they benefit from a flight to safety. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’ve reduced your fixed income exposure, your portfolio won’t benefit from this diversification, so it’s highly likely to suffer when stock markets fall… and that means lower total returns in the long-run.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Bonds are not risk-free</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">As we are on the subject of bonds, it’s worth reminding ourselves about risk again. Once you move away from high-quality bonds to increase income, so the risk increases.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, in the same way that a small overseas bank operating in the UK may have to offer a high rate of interest to attract depositors because of the perceived risk, so does a higher-risk company when issuing bonds. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remember, bonds are just another way that companies can borrow money. So if the yield or income on one bond is higher than another, that’s for a reason.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In recent years, income seeking investors have been attracted by high yield bonds, emerging markets bonds and strategic bond funds (where the manager attempts to increase yield by security selection and market timing), all of which have paid a higher level of income than traditional high-quality bonds. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The problem is, these alternative bond categories tend to behave more like equities when markets fall. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, in the periods when you need them for their capital preservation qualities, they don’t fit the bill – indeed, they can suffer sharp sell-offs. Not what you want from the lower-risk part of your portfolio.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">High yield tends to mean high risk</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Income seekers are not usually thought of as risk takers. But the truth is, reaching for higher incomes in a low yield market does result in additional risk. Figure 2 provides a good example. It shows how different asset classes moved during the global financial crisis, when global stock markets were falling.</p><img id="i-6416e56f23658e34" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/16/4CE8195300000578-0-Figure_2_How_different_bond_categories_performed_during_the_fina-a-8_1528126530499.jpg" height="321" width="634" alt="Figure 2: How different bond categories performed during the financial crisis - October 2007 to March 2009" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are a few important points to note.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The moral of this story is simple: chasing yield by increasing weightings in equities or alternative bond classes can materially reduce the diversification of your portfolio and raise its risk profile.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Next time: In part 4, we will look in more detail at how Vanguard thinks about managing a portfolio for a sustainable income that won’t increase your risk. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Until then, remember to have reasonable expectations in terms of what your portfolio really can deliver. </p><div class="moduleFull"><div class="money item">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Savers are being tempted to give up valuable final salary pensions and run the risk of investing their pots in the financial markets instead, but whether this is a sensible idea will rest on your individual circumstances. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So where do you start if you are considering this crucial retirement decision?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You must pay for financial advice before moving a final salary pension worth £30,000-plus, which is an important safeguard against making an irreversible decision that could ruin your retirement if it goes wrong.  So, it's a useful exercise to find out if there any obvious red flags BEFORE before you fork out for professional advice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pension giant Aegon has therefore compiled the following seven questions to ask yourself at the outset - with the very big caveat that this is for illustration only and should not determine your decision. A decent financial adviser will go into all your circumstances in detail and give you a fully informed recommendation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Employers often dangle gigantic offers potentially worth hundreds of thousands of pounds in front of savers to clear expensive obligations to pay final salary - also known as 'defined benefit' - pensions off their books.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Workers who accept such deals give up a guaranteed income for life, and typically generous payouts to spouses should they die before them, in exchange for large sums paid into inferior pensions they must invest themselves. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But they gain greater control over their fund, the ability to pull all the cash from a pension after the age of 55, and much more flexibility over who is allowed to inherit their retirement pots.</p><img id="i-7dbbd38528952295" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/16/4CE75FCC00000578-5804073-Source_Aegon-a-12_1528125199543.jpg" height="743" width="962" alt="Source: Aegon" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-1e7cdf40-6807-11e8-af06-03ddfe39cf0b">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">How did you answer and what do your results mean? </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The table sets out some of questions which may help you decide whether or not you wish to seek advice on transferring from a defined benefit or final salary scheme,' says Aegon.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If your answers include a number of greens, then as a rule of thumb, it may be worth exploring further although this DOES NOT suggest you should actually transfer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If you have one or more red answer, then the rule of thumb is it may be less worth exploring transferring although again this DOES NOT mean you definitely should not transfer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If you seek advice, your adviser will consider all of your personal circumstances and make a personal recommendation based on these.' </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pitfalls of giving up final salary pensions too readily were exposed in the recent British Steel debacle. In that case,<a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/pensions/article-5391155/Vulture-advisers-bamboozled-British-Steel-savers-say-MPs.html">vulture advisers swooped in to exploit workers</a> in a mis-selling scandal that MPs warned could threaten many other savers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Watchdogs could<a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/pensions/article-5545083/Advisers-face-ban-no-transfer-no-fee-final-salary-pension-offers.html"> ban financial advisers from offering 'no transfer, no fee' deals</a> to savers looking to ditch final salary pensions as a result, due to fears such offers cause conflicts of interest that can influence their recommendations. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Financial Conduct Authority is also looking at whether advisers should offer a 'triage service', which means they could give savers an initial heads-up on whether it is worth paying for a full-scale recommendation on a transfer. However, its current consultation suggests it would place severe restrictions on such an approach in case this was taken as advice. The FCA is due to announce proposals in the autumn.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aegon is in favour of the triage approach, saying it would be beneficial for everyone to cut short the process, saving time and money and allowing advisers to focus on customers more likely to benefit from transferring.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'In medical terms, "triage" involves a professional assessing an individual’s circumstances and determining next steps and their priority,' said Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon. ' But the triage being proposed for defined benefit transfers excludes any professional assessment and is closer to self-diagnosis through google.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We are calling for the FCA to explore what more advisers can offer within guidance to help customers reach an early decision. It’s positive that the FCA has set out a non-exhaustive list of considerations for advisers and we’d like to explore if this could be turned into a standardised traffic lights guide for consumers wondering if it’s worth their while seeking advice. This could be promoted by advisers, guidance bodies and trustees.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Cameron believes the FCA should explore how 'no transfer, no fee' - also known as 'contingent' - charges could continue so advisers and their clients have a range of options for paying for advice, and that isolated instances of bad practice shouldn't constrain this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Contingent charging comes in many shapes and sizes, including separate fees for different stages of the advice process. We believe an outright ban of all types would mean fewer individuals would seek advice, widening the "advice gap".</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There is now huge attention from the regulator in this field, and advice will be checked by the adviser firm’s compliance department and a pensions transfer specialist.' </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Why are people giving up final salary pensions?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Final salary or 'defined benefit' pensions are typically generous and provide a guaranteed income for life. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But increasing number of people are tempted to give them up for a range of reasons - the huge offers they receive from employers, the desire to invest their savings in the hope they will continue to grow, and the opportunity to leave whatever is left over to loved ones when they die. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, pension freedoms launched in 2015 give people in 'defined contribution' schemes, where they and employers contribute to a pot that's invested for retirement, the power to do what they want with their savings once they reach the age of 55. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those still saving into final salary pensions cannot take advantage of these freedoms unless they transfer to a defined contribution scheme, but they have to get financial advice if their pot is worth £30,000-plus. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, leaving a final salary pension scheme means people must bear all the investment risks to their retirement pot going forward.</p><img id="i-3d619a1ec03645e8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/16/4CE75FC800000578-5804073-image-m-20_1528125290679.jpg" height="759" width="962" alt="Pension freedom: Savers are being tempted to give up valuable final salary pensions and run the risk of investing their pots in the financial markets instead, but whether this is a sensible idea will rest on your individual circumstances" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-4527e340-6804-11e8-b203-c93f86f22d46">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">What else should you consider before moving a final salary pension?</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Guidance to British Steel savers offered by Michelle Cracknell of The Pensions Advisory Service applies to any one thinking of giving up valuable final salary pension benefits.

Business Secretary Greg Clark has not repeated the errors of the Melrose-GKN tussle and has been alert to dangers, demanding an assessment of the horizontal impact of the deal, competition among grocers, as well as the impact on the supply chain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A Sainsbury’s-Asda deal, which would cede 60 per cent or so of the UK’s grocery market to the new combination and Tesco, would create a dominant duopoly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The big question is whether it will be beneficial to consumers by challenging the pricing power of the big suppliers.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">If we believe Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe, then greater negotiating power will enable a combined Sainsbury’s-Asda to lower everyday prices on a basket of goods.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But as we report today, wholesalers fear a waterbed effect with suppliers raising prices to smaller players to maintain their overall profit margins causing ‘a massive distortion’ in the market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sainsbury’s-Asda argue the old tests of monopoly power don’t apply because of disruption of food markets by no-frills retailers and online newcomers. But there is some evidence to suggest that the UK may be close to peak Aldi and Lidl, with planning applications for stores slowing sharply and margins shrinking.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So far Amazon Fresh is no more than a blip on the horizon and Just Eat is far from consuming anyone’s dinner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">New CMA chairman Andrew Tyrie will need both his forensic and political skills if Sainsbury’s-Asda is not to become a huge setback to competition on the High Street.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Paper tiger</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Too often British quoted firms are begging to be acquired rather than doing the buying. It is to the credit of paper recycling pioneer DS Smith that it is willing to buck the trend with a £1.5billion deal for Spanish competitor Europac. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unusually for a bidder doing a substantial £1billion rights issue of shares to existing holders, the DS Smith stock climbed to a record high on the deal.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">What Smith does better than rivals is to collect the abandoned cartons from supermarkets across Britain, the Continent and, most recently, some locations in the US and recycle it into attractive packing for online retailers. It does almost all the cartons for Amazon in the UK. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chief executive Miles Roberts in the past expressed worries about the impact of Brexit on its Continental operations. Clearly he is not concerned enough to let an opportunity for expansion into Iberia go by the board.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Too many acquisitions too quickly can make for indigestion, but so far DS Smith has managed expansion and integration well, building itself into an enterprise with a market value of £6.1billion and a place in the FTSE 100. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would be a pity if having made good use of its stock market paper, as that which it recycles, Smith were to become collateral damage in the takeover battle by American giant International Paper for Smurfit Kappa.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> DS Smith (less plastics) is the kind of ecologically sound firm that should not end up in an American landfill.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Royal welcome</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Full marks to Chancellor Philip Hammond for daring to dispose of a chunk of Royal Bank of Scotland shares for an expected £2.6billion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">RBS may have been brought back to health far more quickly had the Government started selling its stake much earlier rather than looking over its shoulder fearing a political blowback if shares were sold at a loss. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The current plan is to sell £15billion of shares by 2023.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bielby said: ‘If suppliers look to compensate with higher prices for other customers, the result could be a massive distortion in the market, which would place an unfair burden on smaller shops and the wholesalers who supply them, and make it difficult to compete.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Independent shops thrive on a mix of great service, tailored product offers and a fair price, and they make a vital contribution both socially and economically. Disadvantaging them so that huge supermarket chains can compete with Aldi and Lidl would be a step backwards.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The FWD claims come as the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) closed submissions for evidence into the merger.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Coupe has promised to match prices across the two supermarkets. For example, a 2lb (1kg) bag of sugar which is 70p at Sainsbury’s, would be reduced to 64p to match the price offered by Asda. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sainsbury’s claims its suppliers can afford to take on the burden of offering lower prices because most of them are multinationals, such as Unilever, which owns Marmite and Dove, and Durex and Dettol owner Reckitt Benckiser.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are almost 50,000 convenience stores in the UK, 74 per cent of which are run by independent retailers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The sector made £38billion sales last year – accounting for more than one fifth of the UK grocery market. If the CMA approves the tie-up, Sainsbury’s-Asda and Tesco will have around 60 per cent of the grocery market share.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman for Sainsbury’s said: ‘We believe that the proposed combination of Sainsbury’s and Asda is great news for customers and suppliers alike.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An Asda spokesman said: ‘Hard-pressed families want and need lower prices. This is at the heart of our strategy – and the deal would accelerate that.’</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The Federation of Wholesale Distributors, which represents food and drink firms, has claimed suppliers would be squeezed by the deal which would create Britain’s biggest supermarket.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The policy decisions made by America's central bank the Federal Reserve and the related rise or fall in the dollar are perhaps the most significant moving parts in the engine of the world economy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As such, all nations around the world are affected by them. However that impact is not evenly spread and one section of the investment world is particularly vulnerable to the Fed's decisions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Emerging markets are typically much more dependent on the dollar than the non-US developed markets.</p><img id="i-282ac59029272c2a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/10/06477E590000044D-5802841-image-a-12_1528104901562.jpg" height="408" width="634" alt="The port in Argentina's capital city, Buenos Aires." class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The principal reason for this is that in many cases their debts are largely in dollars rather than their own sovereign currencies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The US economy is strong at the moment, and seems set to keep strengthening.

The Turkish lira has plunged in value recently as financial markets have taken fright at its large national debt and ongoing borrowing needs.

The absence of a conventional engine creates a large flat floor above the battery and means Jaguar designers could repackage the interior. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It offers motorists enough space for five adults and their luggage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Press the start button, however, and it is eerily silent as the cool electric dashboard dials spring into life. That silence continues when you drive off in one of three optional modes – energy-saving 'eco', general-purpose 'comfort' or full-on sporty 'dynamic'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So for drivers who miss that traditional big cat growl and throaty feline roar and still want a bit of 'brrrm brmm' with their battery-powered car, Jaguar has included an artificial sound to replicate just that. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can even tune its intensity to your personal preference – right up to what Jaguar has called 'maximum attack' aggression when driven in dynamic mode.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once to get the hang of it, and with a tweak to your driving style, the regenerative braking which uses up the energy created when the cars slows down, means you can even drive it without barely ever having to hit the brakes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are two levels or intensity settings for the regenerative braking. At 'low' the car drives pretty much like any conventional automatic car. So you have to apply the brakes to slow down or to anticipate bends.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But set the regenerative braking to 'high' and the car effectively applies the brakes itself the moment you take your foot off the accelerator or simply ease off the pressure. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The result is that with careful use of your right foot, you can effectively drive this car with just one pedal – the accelerator. The extra resistance from from the regenerative braking means the car also generates its own electric power with which to recharge the battery and help extend your range.</p><img id="i-85ec7ff3275f50d1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/22/4CE300E100000578-5801451-image-a-9_1528060637602.jpg" height="565" width="634" alt="The iPace is a blend of sporting prowess, SUV practicality and family saloon or hatchback comfort" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-628cfbabb27dbb7b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/22/4CE300DD00000578-5801451-image-a-10_1528060639930.jpg" height="394" width="634" alt="Priced from £58,995 to £76,995, which includes a taxpayer-funded 'green' subsidy of £4,500, it is available to order in four trim levels: S, SE, HSE and a 'First Edition' launch model" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">So your driving style changes and becomes more efficient to account for this as you attempt smoothly to accelerate, maintain speed or slow down using just your right foot. It almost becomes a game.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The I-PACE certainly feels solid and well planted to the ground. It's quite a heavy car because of the batteries so weight savings have been found elsewhere. But surprisingly nimble for all that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The all-wheel drive from each independently driven wheel means it's pretty sharp around bends. The head up display on the First Edition I drove in a fetching Photon Red was particuarly useful and helps keep your eyes on the road.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's no slouch off-road either, having taken it across some non-tarmac dirt tracks. And who says cats don't like water? It'll wade to a modest depth of shallow water. But it's not designed to tackle more extreme off-roading like a Land Rover.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I even had a chance to put the I-PACE through its paces on the race track to push its speed and handling to the limit in a way not possible on roads and motorways. Very impressive for a car not designed to be raced.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I had a very brief early drive of a prototype I-PACE on a small track on the outskirts of the Geneva Motor Show in Spring. But this was the real deal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jaguar's I-PACE aims to take on maverick US electric car firm Tesla and has pipped to the post a host of mainstream rivals, including Audi's E-Tron, in getting a premium electric carto the market. It has even filmed the I-PACE in a drag-race against both the Tesla Model X 75D and 100D in a 0mph-60mph-0mph head-to-head challenge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">First deliveries are in July, when the first physical cars reach showrooms for viewing and customer demonstrations.

Jaguar's existing E-Pace SUV is also being built there.</p><img id="i-2bdd516a19196fa0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/22/4CE2F3D500000578-5801451-image-a-12_1528060645795.jpg" height="399" width="634" alt="The I-PACE is not manufactured in Britain, but in Graz, in Austria, where it is being built under licence for Jaguar by contract manufacturer Magna Steyr" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-660c9bb783ea1e92" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/22/4CE2FF8700000578-5801451-image-a-11_1528060643288.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="As a 'connected' car, the I-PACE is also the first Jaguar to provide wireless 'over-the-air' software updates" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-ad4e89c620c9f468" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/22/4CE300E900000578-5801451-image-a-13_1528060651123.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="A full length panoramic roof gives the cabin a very airy feel but also absorbs ultra-violet light so there's no need for a blind." class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its sleek, coupe-like silhouette is largely unchanged from the prototype unveiled two years ago. This in turn was influenced by the design of the one-off Jaguar C-X75 supercar prototype – which appeared in the James Bond movie SPECTRE but was never put into production. Its aerodynamic styling includes active vanes in the grille which also open when cooling is required, but close when not needed, to smooth the airflow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For driver and passengers, the absence of a conventional engine and transmission tunnel means there's a flat floor and therefore more interior space. That includes 890mm of rear legroom, a useful 10.5-litre central storage compartment. Sophisticated materials include the premium Kvadrat non-animal textile interior.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Beneath the spacious rear seats are clever stowage spaces for a laptop and tablet, while the rear luggage compartment offers a 656-litre capacity which is expandable to and 1,453-litres with seats folded flat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A full length panoramic roof gives the cabin a very airy feel but also absorbs ultra-violet light so there's no need for a blind.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The upmarket hi-tech Touch Pro Duo 'infotainment' system uses intuitive touchscreens, sensors and tactile physical controls.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Personally I find it a bit spooky and intrusive, but the I-PACE also uses Amazon's Alexa to allow the driver via an app to ask the car questions such as 'Is my car locked? What is the charging level? Do I have enough range to get to work?'. Feels a bit like a spy-in the cab.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a 'connected' car, the I-PACE is also the first Jaguar to provide wireless 'over-the-air' software updates to ensure owners always have seamless access to the latest infotainment, telematics and battery energy control software. I hope over time it works better than some of the software upgrades I have endured on smart-phones and laptops.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The driving force behind the new electric all-wheel drive 'leaping cat' I-PACE is two Jaguar-designed electric motors – one at each axle to drive the front and back wheels. Together they develop a total of 400 horse-power (PS) equivalent to around four Ford Fiestas. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Providing the power is the I-PACE's hi-tech 90kWh Lithium-ion battery comprising 432 'pouch cells'. The battery unit sits centrally between the two axles, and as low down as possible to give perfect 50:50 weight distribution and a low centre of gravity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Range anxiety is always an issue but Jaguar says it will achieve 298 miles on one overnight charge.</p><img id="i-b79f4264ddb490fe" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/22/4CE2F42900000578-5801451-image-a-1_1528060215292.jpg" height="342" width="634" alt="The I-PACE's hi-tech 90kWh Lithium-ion battery comprises 432 'pouch cells' which sit  between the two axles, and as low down as possible to give perfect 50:50 weight distribution" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Owners will be able to achieve an 80 percent battery charge in 85-minutes using a 50kW DC charger.

It assesses the topography of the planned journey and uses 'insights' from previous trips - including driving style - to calculate a personalised range and charging plan. The aim is to reduce the driver's 'range anxiety' – or fear they may run out of juice before they reach their destination.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money floatRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-fa683f00-6784-11e8-852d-d1e3d6204ad6">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">New electric Jaguar I-PACE EV400 </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Price:</strong> from £58,995 to £76,995* (includes a taxpayer-funded 'green' subsidy of £4,500) On sale: Now</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Will it fit in my garage?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Length:</strong> 4,682mm</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Width:</strong> (inc mirrors) 2,139mm Width (excl mirrors) 2,011mm</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Height:</strong> 1,565mm</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Wheelbase: </strong>2,990mm</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Weight:</strong> From 2,133kg</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Top speed:</strong> 124mph</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Acceleration</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>0-60mph: </strong>4.5 seconds</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>0-62mph: </strong>4.8 seconds</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Range:</strong> Up to 298 miles (London to Newcastle)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Luggage space:</strong> 656 litres rear, plus plus 27 front.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Millions of households will soon be struck by higher gas and electricity costs as suppliers push up prices and old cheap tariffs come to an end.

One customer who has fallen foul of its dreadful service is Rita Shead, a 97-year-old woman with dementia. She has been left struggling with an array of unclear bills and an outstanding debt of more than £4,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is despite many delays in the company delivering her bills and her son, David Shead, raising questions over their accuracy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">David says: ‘She was sent multiple bills at the same time. One was for thousands of pounds and it sent her into a spin.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last year Npower delayed sending bills owing to a ‘systems issue’ – a problem affecting an unknown portion of customers. In December last year Rita was sent bills dating back to 2015, each demanding different but large sums of money for usage at her three-bed bungalow in Bournemouth, Dorset.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Competency and efficiency do not seem to be concepts it can deal with in my mother’s case,’ says David. ‘I have no intention of leaving a bill unpaid. I am just not convinced its bills are right.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">David has paid small sums on a regular basis to demonstrate he is not avoiding the issue.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokeswoman for Npower says: ‘There have been some billing delays and missed appointments on the account.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It is now up to date and unfortunately the outstanding debt is £4,169. The debt has been building since 2013 and we have been sending the usual debt collection and advice correspondence.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She adds that Npower is keen to offer additional help and will be recommending an energy efficient home visit. </p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHERE TO SWITCH</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cost is only one consideration when switching. Another big issue is customer service – where there is a wide gap between suppliers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Joe Malinowski, of switching website TheEnergyShop, says: ‘Customers need to be careful where they move to – the savings will not be worth it if you switch to a company with customer service issues.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Big Six are still inundated with complaints – with all but one fielding more customer gripes in the first quarter of this year compared to the final three months of 2017. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">ScottishPower, Npower, Eon, EDF Energy and SSE all saw the number of grievances from customers increase. Only British Gas saw a decrease, albeit from a high number of complaints.</p><img id="i-f7da5db0ab75bd6b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/12/4CD6713100000578-5798145-image-a-5_1527940183245.jpg" height="470" width="306" alt="'The savings will not be worth it if you switch to a company with customer service issues', says Joe Malinowski" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are also tens of thousands of issues each month across all major suppliers that go unresolved for longer than eight weeks, indicative of a large number of complex disagreements.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Younger companies that have fewer customers and modern technology are less distracted by longstanding customer service issues. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it is not always a case of the smaller the better. Some embryonic players could be at risk of becoming overwhelmed when things go wrong if they lack the resources to cope.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, fledgling provider Iresa is banned from taking on new customers or increasing the direct debits of existing customers while it seeks to resolve customer service problems. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ban is in place until the end of this month. If it fails to meet targets set by energy regulator Ofgem its licence could be revoked.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Malinowski also warns that cheap deals offered by cash-hungry small suppliers, against a backdrop of bigger players increasing prices, could signal wider problems.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says: ‘There are cheap deals being offered by small companies that take customer money upfront, before energy has been provided. This could be a sign of financial stress and some of these companies are unproven.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet mid-tier challengers are not without their issues. On Friday Ofgem announced it is investigating how Utility Warehouse manages customers in debt.</p><img id="i-65f59b068392a66b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/12/4CD6718E00000578-5798145-image-a-9_1527940241201.jpg" height="377" width="634" alt="Consumers could save up to £397 if they switch to a cheap fixed-rate energy provider" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Victoria Arrington, of energy comparison site Energyhelpline, says: ‘Loss-leading tariffs could be a viable method of doing business if done with care – as many suppliers do. If not, this strategy could potentially lead to the supplier going under.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But she says customers should not be overly fearful. She adds: ‘Energy is the easiest household bill to switch and can result in an annual saving running into hundreds of pounds.’</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Should a supplier go bust, energy regulator Ofgem will step in to find another provider, a supplier of last resort. But customers may then be moved onto a more costly tariff with the new supplier and any disagreements about billing under the previous one will prove hard to reconcile.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Malinowski adds: ‘Choosing a fly-by-night supplier could be a recipe for disaster. There are what I call safer options, even if they are not the cheapest available. It could be a reasonable offer from an alternative big supplier or a competitive tariff from an established mid-tier provider.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Low income or vulnerable customers in receipt of the Warm Home Discount – a one-off discount of £140 on electricity bills only – should also choose a supplier signed up to this scheme.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Suppliers offering the discount <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://gov.uk/the-warm-home-discount-scheme">can be found online</a>.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">He is delighted with the way the fund has developed, but he knows he cannot take his foot off the pedal. The high valuations put on many listed companies make the case for holding on to them less compelling. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finding value, he says, is becoming more difficult which explains why the fund has a healthy 16 per cent cash holding. He refuses to overpay, preferring instead to play a waiting game until a buying opportunity presents itself.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Apart from its slug of cash, the fund has exposure to just 30 stocks. Most have common characteristics. They are capital light which explains the absence of energy companies, utility and telecoms giants in the portfolio. They are also cash generative with the ability to pay a healthy dividend. </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The result is a fund heavy on companies operating in information technology, health care and consumer goods.Although the number of holdings is small compared to many competing funds, Fourie is constantly assessing whether he has the balance right. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, since the turn of the year, he has built new positions in French food manufacturer Danone, restaurant operator Yum China, South Korean phone giant Samsung, travel software company Sabre and UK firm Sage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To make way for these, he has sold stakes in the drinks manufacturer Pernod Ricard and medical technology firm Stryker. He has also trimmed positions in Microsoft, credit ratings agency Moody’s and United States-based medical equipment company Edwards Lifesciences.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It is all about trying to find value at attractive prices in stock markets that look expensive,’ says Fourie. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The companies we have sold are not bad businesses. Far from it. It is just that their shares, compared to the earnings they are generating, look pricey. If we can find better value in sectors we like, then it is our duty to do so.’</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yum China is a company he currently prefers. It has exclusive rights in China to fast food brands including KFC and Pizza Hut. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fourie adds: ‘Yum China is the kind of Steady Eddie company you want to hold at the moment. It operates through the granting of franchises, absorbs little capital, has no borrowing and generates lots of cash. All of this is underpinned by a good management team at the helm.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fourie and his six-strong global equity team at Sanlam are watching 120 companies, looking only to invest when valuations appear compelling. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sanlam UK is part of South African financial services giant Sanlam Limited.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>G.C. writes:</strong> I am sending you a mailing I have just received offering free entries into the National Lottery. I would like you to clarify if it is a scam.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The mailshot comes from a recently formed firm called Yourlottoservice UK Ltd. On the face of it, this is a remarkable offer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alice Green, who is said to be the company’s head of customer service, writes: ‘We are giving you ten free National Lottery lines as part of an exclusive syndicate.’</p><img id="i-4aa89659423c96d3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/14/4CD6720200000578-5798303-image-a-97_1527946405518.jpg" height="366" width="634" alt="The mailshot comes from a recently formed firm called Yourlottoservice UK Ltd and on the face of it, this is a remarkable offer" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">All you have to do to claim your free lines is call Green and register. What the mailshot does not explain is that to register you must give your name, address, date of birth, gender, phone number and credit or debit card number or bank account details. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also, according to Yourlottoservice’s terms and conditions, ‘such other information and documentation (such as forms of identification) as we may request’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After all this, the mailshot does not actually say how many people will be in the free syndicate along with you, queuing up to share any prize that the ten lines might win.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, nothing is for nothing. The mailshot offer is just a way to get you to pay for lottery entries. The letter does not explain this, but the cost is £6 per draw and since there are National Lottery draws on Wednesday and Saturday that means £12 a week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What you get is unclear. Yourlottoservice says: ‘We may determine that syndicates may involve different numbers of members.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is also unclear how the company expects to make a profit. It can only be slicing and dicing lottery entries in such a way that customers end up paying more than the face value of a ticket. </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yourlottoservice is owned by a company based in Germany and has just one director, Sandra Britta Poepping, who lives in Germany. She was not available when I tried to speak to her a few days ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is a shame as there is quite a large cloud hanging over her business in the shape of Camelot, the company that actually runs the National Lottery. It told me: ‘Under the rules governing National Lottery games, Camelot is not liable to pay out on a ticket that it knows or suspects has been resold or otherwise transferred by way of trade.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is right – buy a ticket from anyone other than Camelot itself or an authorised ticket seller, such as your local newsagent, and there is no guarantee you will get a prize – even if your ticket has all the lucky numbers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Workplace syndicates and the like are fine. Nobody is aiming to make a profit by reselling tickets at more than their face value. But commercial syndicates are prohibited.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just imagine how you would feel if you saw your numbers come up and you counted on a slice of the jackpot, only to be turned down because Camelot spots that Yourlottoservice is involved.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-e45e3aa0-6669-11e8-b97a-ffe5b47f3abc">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">We're watching you... </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">A financial adviser with a history of involvement in failed firms and dodgy deals has finally been banned from acting as a company director.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kevin Gerald Neal, of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, ran Kevin Neal Associates Wealth Management. Under a deal with the Financial Conduct Authority, the firm took responsibility in 2011 for the debts of Neal’s previous advice firm which was put into liquidation by the High Court.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By 2014, the wealth management firm owed clients at least £573,000 after complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service were upheld. The regulator ordered Neal not to strip the business of assets without its consent, but Neal and his wife Cheryl – also a director – took cash and cars worth more than £77,000. The business failed with debts of £9.4 million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Action by the Insolvency Service means Kevin Neal, 60, cannot run a new firm for six years while Cheryl Neal is banned for four years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Neal hit the headlines a year ago when he was sued by a client of his, Alan Shearer, for £9 million. In court documents the football star described Neal as ‘dishonest’ in the advice he gave. The claim was settled out of court.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is unclear why Neal was still authorised as an adviser.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness’ – according to author George Orwell. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet despite such a daunting challenge many still dream of penning a masterpiece – and embarking on a lucrative and rewarding career.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, we share tips from those who have written a book – including secrets on how to get one published and make some money.</p><img id="i-644320ff1dd74756" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/14/4CD7858800000578-5798259-image-a-1_1527946174124.jpg" height="381" width="634" alt="Tracey Waples, a 52-year-old mother of two, invested £4,000 in a six-month course with Faber &amp; Faber after embarking on a first novel" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>DEVELOP AN INITIAL IDEA</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An idea - whether a clever plot, unusual character or inspiration from real life – is only the start.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many novices launch into writing projects with great enthusiasm only to give up after a few weeks. They find their story soon runs out of steam or ends up getting lost in a vague plot. After an initial rush of energy they shelve the project.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Completing the task requires that you build a plot structure and take time to flesh it out. Even with a great idea and commitment to seeing it through, professional guidance is often essential.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The £25 Writers’ &amp; Artists’ Yearbook 2018 provides details of writing courses that can help. Among the most highly regarded are those run by publishers such as Faber &amp; Faber, Curtis Brown Creative and Penguin Random House. You might also be inspired by local adult education courses in writing which can be found on a website Hotcourses.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tracey Waples, a 52-year-old mother of two, invested £4,000 in a six-month course with Faber &amp; Faber after embarking on a first novel. It was worthwhile because it helped get her book ready for publication.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tracey already had a character in her head for the book I Want Never Gets and believes having someone she could believe in was vital for success.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She says: ‘Mulling the story over while out for walks helped prior to putting pen to paper. It made me discover that the main character was a nasty piece of work. But I did not know where the story was heading until it was completed. Writing can feel like uncovering a story already there – a bit like archaeology – but I found the expert guidance from the Faber &amp; Faber course to be invaluable.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tracey, who lives in Albury, Hertfordshire, adds: ‘It felt pretentious calling myself a writer but being on a course surrounded by like-minded people eased that self-conscious concern. It is important not to be precious with a book and be prepared to rewrite sections until it feels right.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Self-help books on writing can also provide support. Among these are On Writing by Stephen King and Nail Your Novel by Roz Morris.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Morris says: ‘Failing to finish a novel is a common problem. You must have a plot that carries you through to the end. Study other books in the genre you hope to write in – looking at key aspects such as the tricks used to keep a reader hooked.’</p><img id="i-44537e341c9bc9d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/14/4CD670D100000578-5798259-image-m-68_1527944415276.jpg" height="735" width="634" alt="Self-help books on writing can  provide support including Nail Your Novel by Roz Morris " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tracey Waple’s book is published by Endeavour Media and will be available later this month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WRITE FOR LOVE AND NOT MONEY</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aspriring authors have to accept that all the blood, sweat and tears which go into writing a novel may count for nothing. Dedication is essential.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clare Empson struggled for ten years to get her book into shape before finally finding a publisher. Her debut, Him, is a dark love story that will be published by Orion on August 23.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 50-year-old says: ‘I would sacrifice weekends away with the family to make progress. I spent countless hours alone writing and rewriting. At one point it got me down and I wondered if it would all come to nothing. But I realised I loved writing too much. Would it make me happier if I simply stopped? The answer was a big no.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To keep motivated Clare started meeting up with two other writers and they still regularly get together to share thoughts and ideas.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The mother-of-three, who lives in Mere, Wiltshire, says: ‘I also learnt that it was not simply a case of writing a book and then ending it. What comes next is a lot of rewriting – taking expert advice from agents who are skilled at publishing books. You should never stop looking to improve and make your novel sharper and getting the right pace for it.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clare is one of the talented – and lucky – ones. She has signed a six- figure international book deal for her novel and a sequel through agent Curtis Brown. But she says money should not be the motivation for writing a book – there are far easier ways to get rich.</p><img id="i-6dcf56fffec1b65f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/14/4CD671DA00000578-5798259-image-m-72_1527944443751.jpg" height="466" width="306" alt="Clare's debut, Him, is a dark love story that will be published by Orion on August 23" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-22e46b548ad752f8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/14/4CD670CD00000578-5798259-image-a-73_1527944452796.jpg" height="466" width="306" alt="Clare Empson struggled for ten years to get her book into shape before finding a publisher" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">A first-time novelist might receive an advance of just £3,000 plus a cut of any sales – known as royalties – of some 8 per cent. The advance is recouped from royalties so the bigger this is the longer it will take to earn any royalties. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Writers can be dazzled by the exceptions such as Harry Potter author JK Rowling who is now worth £500 million. But the vast majority of authors do not make enough money to live off and write simply for love – keeping the day job going.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>TAKE A DISCIPLINED APPROACH</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A story idea is the easy bit. The hard part is sitting down to complete the book and find a publisher.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Famous novelists such as James Bond author Ian Fleming managed to write bestsellers in less than a month. But the skill and dedication to get to this level took years – with failure and rewrites part of the process.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other greats such as W Somerset Maugham made the written word look easy to put down on paper – yet took ‘laborious days’ of studying others to develop their skills. The 20th Century novelist took a decade before completing novel The Painted Veil.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tracey Waples knows all too well the sacrifices required to write a novel. She would get up at 5.30 every morning so she could start penning her psychological thriller.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She says: ‘For me the secret was to have a routine where I put aside time every morning to write. It was not about reaching a certain word count but instilling a disciplined habit even when I was not in the mood to write.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>SEEK AN AGENT</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sam Copeland is a literary agent at Rogers, Coleridge &amp; White in Notting Hill, West London. He receives 300 pitches a month – almost all of which end up in the bin. He might take on four new authors in a year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says: ‘People will always want to write books. But to get it on the bookshelves what you really need is an agent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Most publishers will not touch you without one. Also, an agent is key to making sure a book is in the best shape possible – and help you strike the best deal.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Copeland believes writers should avoid so-called vanity publishing – where you end up paying a publisher to get your book on the market. A good agent, he says, will edit your book for free.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But he warns: ‘There is no way to sugar coat this. For 99.5 per cent of manuscripts sent in the answer is no. We are not right every time but we are skilled at spotting something with potential. I am afraid that rejection is part of the writing journey.’</p><img id="i-92b48903e467623f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/13/4CD6721600000578-5798259-image-a-66_1527944376560.jpg" height="420" width="634" alt="Fifty Shades Of Grey writer EL James is worth £40million" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Copeland adds: ‘There are no hidden secrets – and gimmicks do not work. It does not matter what the subject is – a script must stand out as exceptional. It must be a book you find hard to put down. A budding author must write with confidence and authority so the words feel right where they sit on the page.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The fortunate handful that are accepted usually hand over 15 per cent of all the money they make from their books to the agent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What Copeland and other agents typically want is a brief synopsis, along with the book’s first three chapters. Details of agents can be found in the industry bible Writers’ &amp; Artists’ Yearbook 2018.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>GET OUT AND SELL</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Writing a book is just the start. You then have to make sure people go out and buy the novel. Those fortunate enough to have an agent who has signed them up to a well-known publisher can rely on the company public relations machine to kick into action – contacting bookshops to stock the novel, organising a launch party and seeing if they can also have the book translated and sold abroad.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But others must do the marketing themselves. There is plenty you can do to help shift your novel off the bookshelf.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Roz Morris says: ‘Formulate a plan of attack. See if you can get family and friends to contact their local bookshop and ask them for a copy of the book – and to order more in.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also contact local press – newspapers and radio stations – for interviews about your book and try to organise a signing at a local bookshop.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kim Nash of publisher Bookouture believes it is important to take advantage of the internet – self-publicising on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter plus exploring the world of blogs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She says: ‘There is an army of book bloggers out there eager to review new novelists. These include Kim The Bookworm – which is me, CrimeBookJunkie and Random Things Through My Letterbox. Ask them to look at your novel as it helps spread the word.’</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-461532f0-6663-11e8-b97a-ffe5b47f3abc">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Ebooks and even self-publishing COULD earn authors millions </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><img id="i-d4318b6e75dbbc63" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/13/4CD6721200000578-5798259-image-a-65_1527944368991.jpg" height="400" width="284" alt="Self-starter: Fifty Shades Of Grey writer EL James is worth £40million" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">You do not need a book deal to get your first novel published. There are self-publishing and ebook options aplenty.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Novelist and writing tutor Roz Morris says self-publishing is not just for amateurs as many professional authors also use it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The bestselling erotic thriller Fifty Shades Of Grey by EL James began as a self-published ebook in 2011 before being snapped up by a mainstream publisher and turned into a film. The author is now worth £40 million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Morris says: ‘The self-publishing route gives writers independence and freedom of choice. But it should not be seen as an easy way out. You still need professional guidance and editing to ensure the book is of the highest quality.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Morris, whose self-published works include Lifeform Three and Not Quite Lost, believes a good starting place is the Alliance of Independent Authors.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This association can provide guidance on reputable firms which can help you self-publish in print and online as well as provide editorial support.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hiring a professional editor to go through a manuscript can cost more than £2,000 but Morris believes it is money well spent if it transforms a rough draft into a well-crafted novel. Joining a writing group can also help.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can fork out £200 or so for software that puts a book into ebook form and allows you to choose an off-the-peg front cover. An independently designed cover may cost £400.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You might consider self-publishing providers such as Amazon, IngramSpark, Clays, and CPI. Amazon – through its Kindle Book Publishing arm – charges £790 for a package including software, proofreading and cover design for both print-on-demand and ebooks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kim Nash of ebook publisher Bookouture believes companies like hers are also worth contacting because of the expert support they provide. She says: ‘Producing a book does not cost the author a penny with us – though you are only accepted if we believe the book has potential.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We offer editing expertise and help with marketing and the cover. You get no advance but receive 45 per cent royalties of any income from selling your ebook.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite the price of online books being between 99p and £1.99, Nash points out that its bestselling author Angela Marsons has sold 2.8 million books online. So ebooks can also be lucrative. </p></div>                        </div><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Despite such a daunting challenge many still dream of penning a masterpiece – and embarking on a lucrative and rewarding career.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Online shopping is expected to account for 18 per cent of retail spending in Britain this year. That is a sizeable proportion, but it still means that more than 80 per cent of purchases are made in physical outlets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Looking ahead, experts believe that even if online sales continue to grow, the vast majority of shopping will continue to be done in bricks-and-mortar stores.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The way consumers shop is changing however, making location more important than ever. <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://investing.thisismoney.co.uk/quote/EPIC">Ediston Property Investment Company </a>prides itself on owning the right sites in the right places and managing them in such a way as to deliver a consistent and attractive income to shareholders.</p><img id="i-dce9cd738a6ba5b1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/09/4CD6717100000578-5798509-Nearly_75_per_cent_of_that_portfolio_is_out_of_town_retail_parks-a-1_1528101069512.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Focus on location: Nearly 75 per cent of that portfolio is out-of-town retail parks in Scotland, Wales, the Midlands and the North" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unusually, the firm pays monthly dividends so investors are also rewarded 12 times a year for owning Ediston stock.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Edinburgh-based firm is run by Calum Bruce, who has spent his career in the property sector. Bruce and his team take an unusually active approach to their sites.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most companies employ one surveyor to look after 30 to 35 properties. Ediston has ten surveyors for about 40 properties, so it puts much more effort into analysing sites before buying them. It also spends more time developing relationships with tenants once properties have been acquired.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The strategy works. When Ediston floated, around a quarter of its portfolio was vacant. Today, only 0.7 per cent of the group’s properties are not generating any rental income. At the same time, the estate has grown from a portfolio valued at £77 million in 2014 to £325 million today. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nearly 75 per cent of that portfolio is out-of-town retail parks in Scotland, Wales, the Midlands and the North. Bruce has focused on this sector because retail parks in these regions offer good value in today’s environment and appeal to both store owners and shoppers.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Retailers like them because rents are cheaper than on the high street and in city centre shopping malls.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It also means they can open bigger stores and offer easy click-and-collect access. Consumers like the accessibility too and Ediston works hard to ensure that stores are appropriate to each location, focusing on value in less affluent areas of the country, for example. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a result, Bruce has been able to raise rents, extend leases and offer firms such as Iceland and discount retailer B&amp;M more space, while driving down vacancies. The group owns office space, too, again away from the South East.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bruce recently acquired a development site in Haddington, 15 miles east of Edinburgh, where he hopes to build a retail park. The town is growing fast and large shops are in short supply, so the project should generate considerable value over time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Midas verdict:</strong> Ediston Property offers investors a good blend of conservatism, expertise and enterprise. Bruce focuses on delivering returns to shareholders so acquisitions and developments are undertaken only if they are likely to boost income and capital growth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ambition is to expand the portfolio to at least £500 million in the next few years. In the meantime, shareholders can enjoy that monthly dividend. At 111p, the shares are a good long-term investment.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Ediston Property Investment Company prides itself on owning the right sites in the right places and managing them to deliver a consistent and attractive income to shareholders.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 46-year-old criminal law executive developed a fear of flying as a teenager and has not been on a plane since his honeymoon to Italy 18 years ago with wife Rhian.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jamie was forced to cancel a holiday he booked with friends to Spain after realising he could not get on the flight. He lost around £400 as his insurer considered the phobia a pre-existing condition which had been reported to his doctor.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He adds: ‘The only way I have dealt with my aerophobia is to avoid flying altogether.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Williams says: ‘Being honest with an insurer means you are less liable to having your policy declared invalid should you need to claim. If it is likely that your condition could prevent you from stepping on a plane it is vital to declare it beforehand.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is because aerophobia might result in a holidaymaker requiring medical assistance mid-flight – or in a worst-case scenario a plane needing to divert so that treatment can be sought. Williams adds: ‘Costs are likely to be incurred – which may then pass to you.’</p><img id="i-d1daf77e0283b3be" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/13/4CD670D900000578-5798211-image-a-41_1527942767160.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Failing to inform an insurer about the condition in advance can mean a claim being denied if a holidaymaker then pulls out of a trip" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">A 46-year-old aerophobe determined to reach Florida by air would pay between £53 and £97 for a two-week travel policy according to Compare Cover. Someone without the phobia would be quoted between £19 and £25.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The insurer also compared the cost of travel insurance for someone with aerophobia and another with asthma. A 40-year-old with the phobia wishing to fly to Spain for two weeks would pay on average £24, whereas an asthma sufferer would pay £17. Flying phobia can be addressed. London-based psychologist Anna Albright says there are three main actions.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">She says: ‘The obvious one is to not fly at all which is what a lot of people do. They can also take a fear of flying course with one of the airlines. A third option is to undergo cognitive behavioural therapy with a psychologist and find a way of overcoming the anxiety.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Albright says that ‘over-prepping’ for a flight is the biggest mistake that aerophobes make. She says: ‘It is unhelpful to think through all the possible scenarios that could happen on a flight for weeks ahead. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A psychologist can also help you cope once aboard by encouraging you to focus on specific activities. For example, doing a crossword to engage the brain can be a good coping mechanism.’</p><img id="i-1edee17e572d51dd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/13/4CD670F600000578-5798211-image-a-46_1527942864856.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="One in six people are affected by this severe form of flying nerves, yet half  still choose to fly" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>DREAD OF DRIVING</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many people develop a fear of driving, perhaps following an accident or illness. But this may only affect their motor insurance premiums if the DVLA – the Government motoring authority – considers the problem serious and the insurer considers them a greater risk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dan Hutson is head of motor at website Comparethemarket. He says: ‘When searching for car insurance, you are required to declare whether you have disclosed any medical conditions to the DVLA. </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">For certain conditions such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, drivers are required to tell the DVLA. But for others, such as agoraphobia, you only need to do so if it makes you a riskier driver or if your doctor advises you to. With any mental health problem you should always talk with your doctor about whether you need to let the DVLA know.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are no mental health problems that require drivers to give up their licence. Instead, the DVLA will judge cases on an individual basis. Failing to tell the DVLA about a medical condition which affects a person’s driving can result in a fine up to £1,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hutson adds: ‘Disclosing a condition to the DVLA may affect motor premiums, but only if the condition influences a motorist’s driving ability and means their licence needs to be reviewed on a regular basis. This might mean that insurers view them as a greater risk.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He adds: ‘As with any insurance policy, a claim could be invalidated if a policyholder has not disclosed all relevant information including a notifiable medical condition or a restricted driving licence.’</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-4713f030-6661-11e8-b97a-ffe5b47f3abc">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Pilots' course helped me cure my fear of flying</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><img id="i-4c0f28b8e44561da" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/13/4CD6711400000578-5798211-image-a-43_1527942781384.jpg" height="426" width="284" alt="Neil Robertson was so scared of flying he gave it up for 10 years in his twenties" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Neil Robertson used to be paralysed with nerves before any flight – often for weeks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 36-year-old IT director who lives in Windsor, Berkshire, says: ‘It made me angry, defensive and argumentative. I was not able to plan or consider any activities after the flight because I could not see beyond it. My life was essentially on hold. At one point I could not even drive past Heathrow Airport without getting nervous.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was so gripped with fear that he gave up flying for 10 years in his twenties. He recalls: ‘I used to have to travel to Marseilles a lot for work. On the last occasion before I stopped, I basically could not go to the airport. I never made it past the front door. After that, I took trains everywhere.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Three years ago he decided enough was enough. He recalls: ‘I had a promotion at work that was contingent on me flying. I also did not want to “infect” my young family with my phobia.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He signed up for the British Airways ‘flying with confidence’ course, a one-day seminar delivered by members of the airline’s pilots and cabin crew. Part of the programme involved pilots explaining what they do and how planes work, while a psychologist offered tips on how to manage panic. At the end of the day Neil boarded a 45-minute flight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The course worked for Neil – who has flown at least 50 times since. BA reports a 98 per cent success rate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Neil, who has since flown all over the world, says his fear stemmed from past minor incidents such as aborted take-offs and landings and bad turbulence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says: ‘My brain learnt to react badly and irrationally. The course gave me confidence and the ability to deflect panic attacks before they could take hold. It took 18 months and a dozen flights for the anxiety to disappear but I laugh in the face of turbulence these days.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now he is looking forward to a family trip in August. He says: ‘For the first time, the entire extended Robertson family are flying to Spain to celebrate the retirement of my parents.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Courses: BA ‘Flying With Confidence’: June 30 (Heathrow £329, Edinburgh £275). Virgin Atlantic ‘Flying Without Fear’: June 24 (Southampton £267). EasyJet ‘Fearless Flyer’: June 29/30 (Gatwick £209).

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Nathalie Dauriac has emerged bruised but unbowed from an explosive court case against phone tycoon John Caudwell that has appalled, fascinated and divided the City.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, she says that, contrary to his claims, she has emerged the winner, but that her case should be seen as an example of the sexist treatment meted out to professional women.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She claims she and other women in the Caudwell business empire were subjected to poor treatment and described in abusive and sexist language.</p><img id="i-d36c531facfe76d2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/16/4CD6715100000578-5798515-image-a-244_1527954071924.jpg" height="431" width="634" alt="Nathalie Dauriac claims she and other women in the Caudwell business empire were subjected to poor treatment and described in abusive and sexist language" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">This, she says, wasn’t sufficiently acknowledged by the judge, and she has written to the Chancellor of the High Court asking him to look at the attitudes taken by the judiciary towards female professionals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I am not a feminist,’ she says, ‘but I am concerned the court appeared to condone bad language and behaviour against me and other women working in Caudwell businesses.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before their acrimonious legal battle, the pair were not only business associates, but the closest of friends. Caudwell, 65, acted as a mentor and paternal figure towards Dauriac, a French money manager 25 years his junior. He was even godfather to her daughter Juliette, now aged six, though he has no relationship with the girl now.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Though both sides say the relationship was platonic, it was close. He invited her on his yacht and skiing in Vail, but in court they interpreted these trips differently. He saw them as holidays, she saw them as business trips, where £600 million of deals were done as a result.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At one point, Caudwell asked one of the QCs: ‘Why did she tell me she loved me, every day?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And when questioned as to why he told her he loved her, he replied: ‘Because I did. Because I was genuine. Because I meant it.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no love lost now. And, after a blistering battle in court, both sides are claiming victory.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She says she’s the winner because Caudwell was ordered to pay £500,000 for her shares. The judge also ruled she was constructively dismissed, after she was ousted from the wealth management business she set up with him and given a token £2 for her shares.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says he has come out on top as the judge called Dauriac a ‘remarkably unsatisfactory witness’, agreed that she made £33,000 of improper expense claims and awarded her less than she wanted.</p><img id="i-5fb44c7e6490c771" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/16/4CD839B900000578-5798515-image-a-252_1527955056557.jpg" height="404" width="634" alt="Dauriac claims she and other women in the Caudwell business empire were subjected to poor treatment and described in abusive and sexist language" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘His suggestion that he somehow “won” the case is obvious nonsense,’ Dauriac says, adding that she is ‘shocked’ at the judge’s ‘indifference’ as to what she sees as sexism in the workplace. She says: ‘I don’t want my daughter, or my son, to grow up in a society where oppression and verbal abuse of women is considered acceptable.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dauriac does not accept that her expenses – including a £135 bill for hairdressing at Mad Lillies salon in Hampstead or a £104 birthday cake for her former husband Konrad Stoebe – were improper. She says the hairdo was so she looked impeccable at a client event, and the cake was served at a client dinner.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-cf1fd7d0-6708-11e8-a266-cf187e7cf0f2">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox">We did £600m of business on the back of £33,000 expenses. I disagree with the judge's view of it </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘That is a cake I will regret for the rest of my life but it is blown out of proportion. To put it in context, most of the money was spent on travel to see John. We did £600 million of business on the back of £33,000 of expenses over three years. The judge didn’t believe it was wholly and necessarily in the course of business, but this is how our industry works. I disagree with the judge’s view, but there is nothing I can do about it.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dauriac’s supporters believe that, as a young and attractive woman, she has been the victim of sexism. For Team Caudwell she is a scheming Machiavellian who spent company money as if it were her own.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Caudwell says she ‘has taken me to hell and back over the past three years.’ He adds: ‘Nathalie is using the extremely important issue of sexism in the workplace as cover for her humiliating defeat.’ He also says she was ‘dishonest’ and was awarded much less than she tried to ‘extort.’ It is clear the courtroom battle has come at a heavy cost to each of them, personal and financial.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Both have spent millions on legal bills, which Caudwell can easily afford as a self-made billionaire who left school at 16. He built Phones 4U from scratch, before selling out to private equity investors in 2006.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dauriac, by contrast, is not in the super-rich league. ‘I had to sell my house in Hampstead to fight for justice,’ she says. ‘I think John believed I couldn’t afford to go to court, but I felt I had no choice than to fight.’</p><img id="i-ca8c39703f3fa990" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/09/45AB0EE300000578-5798515-image-m-5_1528015090306.jpg" height="716" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-7e73f2695e7d0baf" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/09/45AA4B0E00000578-5798515-image-a-6_1528015106511.jpg" height="716" width="306" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">She now lives with her new partner, Dan, a lawyer, and the four children they have between them. She denies suggestions that third parties were bankrolling her case, saying: ‘I funded it myself. I had to put the financial security of my family at risk. I repeatedly asked to settle this with an independent valuation of my shares, but sadly it didn’t happen or we could have avoided three years of legal action and a lot of expense. John spent large sums on lawyers, which could have gone to the children’s charities he likes to support. What a waste.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Though her own costs may be huge, Dauriac insists she has no regrets, saying: ‘This is about basic fairness towards a woman who succeeded, as I did, in the male-dominated financial services industry.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A Frenchwoman brought up in Bordeaux, Dauriac came to England 20 years ago to do a postgraduate diploma at the University of Cambridge and never left the UK. She met Caudwell while working for private bank Coutts. There, she says, she became the youngest senior client partner at 26.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2009, aged 29, she left to set up Signia Wealth. Caudwell was the controlling shareholder with a 51 per cent stake and was also a major client. She had a 49 per cent stake.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I founded that business from my sofa at home with £300,000. I put in my sweat equity,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I built it to £2.3 billion of assets under supervision in five years. John and I were super-close. As a client and as a friend, I trusted him implicitly. We never had any problems until 2014. I don’t know why it went wrong then. All I can think is that I disagreed with some of his behaviour and decisions, and he doesn’t like people standing up to him.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After she fell out with Caudwell, she says she was ‘subjected to relentless pressure’ and ‘a series of outrageous demands’ as the price of keeping her job. The court heard how she was pressured into agreeing to a lie detector test and to see a psychiatrist, accompanied by Caudwell. Dauriac was also asked not to have any more children until the business was a success.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She says: ‘I was called many names including “sociopath”.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Matt Monro Jnr, the son of the famous crooner Matt Monro, initially struggled to make ends meet as a singer to keep his father’s name alive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Monro Jnr, whose father had huge hits in the 1950s and 1960s with Born Free, On Days Like These, From Russia With Love and Portrait Of My Love, took up singing at age 21 after his father died.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He feels close to his late father when he sings his songs on stage, he says, and it has helped him come to terms with the loss.</p><img id="i-fad0e22b9c572431" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/14/4CD671EE00000578-0-image-a-105_1527946947648.jpg" height="576" width="634" alt="Monro Jnr took up singing at age 21 after his father,Matt Monro, died" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He remembers his father – described as one of the finest male vocalists in the business by Frank Sinatra – as a generous individual who spoilt him and his sister with presents while taking care not to spend much on himself.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Matt Monro Jnr is touring the UK this autumn with his show about his father, The Matt Monro Story, a mix of music and memories. Tickets are available from mattmonrojnr.co.uk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now 54, Matt Monro Jnr lives with his wife Chandrika, 50, in Battersea, South-West London. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What did your parents teach you about money?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My dad came from a humble background. He was poor and as a child spent time in foster homes. He then worked as a roadsweeper and lorry driver to support himself and his family. As a result, after he had made it big, he was careful with his money. He would say: ‘You do not know what is around the corner’.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the same time, he was always generous. He spoilt me and my sister. At Christmas, we never wanted for anything. We would get a main present, plus a four foot high stocking crammed full of sweets and little gifts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We would end up with about 40 presents to open. Every 18 months, we went to exotic places such as Barbados to enjoy five weeks of holidaying.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My mum was cagey with money. She was the bank.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How much pocket money did you get as a child?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Five pounds a week from age eight. I would spend it straightaway on sweets. I liked gobstoppers, liquorice allsorts and lemon sherbets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What was the first paid work you ever did?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I got a job at age 17 as a bank clerk at NatWest for around £8,000 a year. At that time I had no interest in showbusiness at all. I wanted to become a golf professional.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">My dad forced me to take the bank job so I would have a way of making a living in case my golf dream did not work out. I did not enjoy the work. I spent all my free time playing golf. I only decided to become a singer when my father died two weeks before my 21st birthday. He died way too young.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Have you ever struggled to make ends meet?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, often. The worst period was between 1987 and 1997. At the time, I was not a good singer and I was earning peanuts – £50 a night.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It horrified my mum – she never wanted me to go into showbusiness. But I sang to keep my dad’s name alive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If I had not done it, I would have cracked. I feel like he has not left me when I sing his songs and pay tribute to him on stage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Have you ever been paid silly money per hour for a job?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I once earned $10,000 for an hour-long show I did in Asia. There I can attract up to 25,000 people to a show – in this country, it is 500 to 1,500.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What was the best year of your life in terms of the money you made?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I did a big international tour in 2008 and that boosted my annual earnings to £100,000. Back in those days, my dad’s fans were still around but things have now changed – he would have been 88 today.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am also working less because my priorities have changed since I got married for the second time. I want to enjoy myself a bit more. Showbusiness has become a bit stale for me.</p><img id="i-660b99c90c505750" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/14/4CD671E600000578-0-image-a-106_1527946956418.jpg" height="215" width="634" alt="His father was described as one of the finest male vocalists in the business by Frank Sinatra" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What is the most expensive thing you have ever bought yourself just for fun?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My set of custom-made golf clubs which cost about £2,500. My dad took me to play golf when I was seven years old and I have been playing ever since. In the summer I like to go two or three times a week and I also try to play once a week in the winter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What is the biggest money mistake you have ever made?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Getting married to my first wife. No one ever wins when you get divorced. We both had to downsize and it was a financial pain in the backside. I was probably £100,000 worse off afterwards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What is the best money decision you have ever made?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Buying our two-bedroom apartment in London’s Battersea. We own it outright without a mortgage. It is only 800 square feet, but it is just the right size. It overlooks the Thames and there is a gym, cinema and underground parking in the complex.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Battersea is booming. Since we bought the flat 18 months ago it has gone up in value from £865,000 to £1.2 million. House prices in the area have gone through the roof.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Do you save into a pension or invest in the stock market?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No. Investing in the stock market is of no interest and I do not have a pension or life insurance. My wife and I started a commercial and residential property development business 18 months ago which has been successful. We convert office blocks into apartments. I expect that will provide me with a retirement income.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Do you always pay off your credit cards in full?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No. Sometimes I pay just the minimum. On a typical £5,000 transaction I will pay £1,500 a month until it is cleared. I do not mind paying interest if it suits my needs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What is the one little luxury you like to treat yourself to?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Going on a week-long golfing holiday to Turkey with my friends. We go every year to a five-star resort and play every single day. The weather is always beautiful. It is paradise – like golf heaven – and costs £1,200.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>If you were Chancellor of the Exchequer, what is the first thing you would do?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I would increase the funds for the National Health Service until there was no funding crisis. I think we are incredibly lucky in this country to have the NHS – and to know with certainty that people who are not well off can access this quality medical care.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Do you think it is important to give to charity?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Absolutely. I take part in charitable events for Cancer Research because that is what my dad died of.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Finally, what is your number one financial priority?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To enjoy my life while living within my means.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Monro Jnr, whose father had huge hits in the 1950s and 1960s with Born Free, On Days Like These, From Russia With Love and Portrait Of My Love, took up singing at age 21 after his father died.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Toby Walne has just managed to do what all customers affected by TSB’s computer meltdown should try – successfully claim compensation. Here he explains how he went about getting the bank to pay up.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They seem a distant memory – the halcyon days five years ago when TSB offered a ‘welcome back to local banking’. It took me a while, but the bank got me in the end. How I wish I had not fallen for the bait.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lured by its £30 million marketing campaign with watercolours of friendly bank staff I signed up for a ‘free’ business account – for the first 18 months.</p><img id="i-b3f5ccc08b5fc30e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/14/04E5669900000514-5798289-image-a-80_1527945809785.jpg" height="270" width="634" alt="Toby Walne has managed to successfully claim £100 compensation from TSB" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In retrospect, I should have researched the artist behind the cartoons. He was Steve Small, creator of the Mr Bean animation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is hard not to draw parallels between the accident-prone nincompoop and TSB boss Paul Pester who has been forced to ‘give up’ a £1.6 million ‘integration bonus’ for the bank’s catastrophic computer meltdown. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The IT failure started in April and has yet to be sorted, making my blood boil. Like five million other TSB customers, I was told in April we would move to a new IT system.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A self-congratulatory leaflet sent by post told me the bank was preparing ‘for the digital age’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But once the migration went into meltdown, I was back in the dark ages. Initially, I was unable to access my online account to pay my household bills. When I eventually logged on I was told my password was wrong. I got on the phone, only to be left on permanent hold or to be met with an engaged tone.</p><img id="i-679d740ce2feced2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/14/4CD671FA00000578-5798289-image-a-79_1527945798618.jpg" height="367" width="306" alt="'The IT failure started in April and has yet to be sorted, making my blood boil'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even now ‘access issues’ have not gone away. I got a text last week from TSB – more than a month after the initial meltdown – saying my account was being suspended. I was at the end of my tether and decided it was time to quit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But before switching to another business account provider I thought it was worth asking for some cash as a result of the chaos wrought. A brass neck was needed as I asked for £100. Give it and I would stay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jenny, from customer relations, rang. She tried to soothe me with words of empathy, plus lame excuses. My response was polite and friendly – I was not for budging. Hand over the money or I quit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jenny said there was a compensation calculator she had to use. ‘We are willing to pay £12 to your phone bill for the calls you made,’ she said. An insult.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But as I was ready to say goodbye, she added: ‘For distress and inconvenience caused… £100.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I had hit the jackpot. Being polite yet firm paid off. I suggest other TSB customers follow my lead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Have you had a TSB horror story?

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Travel insurance is designed to protect you if something goes wrong with your holiday and you need to cancel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This can be for lots of different reasons and it is valid from the moment the policy starts, so if you fall ill before you go away you can claim for any money you've already paid out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, there are a lot of hidden clauses within any travel insurance policy which can catch you out, and leave you out of pocket, if you're not aware of them.</p><img id="i-c017b3c5a78389b7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/15/4C8E6CA300000578-5762569-image-a-3_1527084498026.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Bottoms up: Having one glass of wine might invalidate your travel insurance policy" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">This includes, being covered twice - such as if you have a travel insurance policy with your bank account and you've bought a separate one, going on a cruise without the right policy or drinking too much and then trying to make a claim. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here we've listed a few other less common clauses found within travel insurance small print.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1. Having a drink might invalidate your insurance</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While on holiday most people will have a few alcoholic drinks, however if something happens to you, such as having an accident or getting injured, and you were under the influence of alcohol this could affect your insurance claim.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Different insurers have different limits for this and most take incidents on a case by case basis. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is because everyone's tolerance levels are different and for some a glass or two of wine may not make a difference, while for others this could make a big impact.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Generally, if the alcohol you've drunk is affecting your judgement, it could affect your claim – although it's hard to see how  this could be proven in practical terms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. If you're going on a cruise you'll need specialist cover</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As cruise holidays are different to standard holidays, they tend to be longer, include several different countries, and often non-standard water sports, your standard travel insurance might not cover you.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact just 56 per cent of single and 59 per cent of annual policies include cover for a cruise trip as standard and if you do get it wrong and end up having to claim – and find out your insurance doesn't cover you – you could be left severely out of pocket.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The level of protection for cruise trips also varies depending on the insurer and the policy you've bought.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, some policies include compensation for what's called 'cabin confinement', if you're too ill to leave your cabin and miss out on one or more days of the cruise. Of the policies available, 54 per cent of single and 45 per cent of annual, provide this as standard, according to Defaqto.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The level of compensation paid out also varies considerably, with some paying out just £10 a day and others up to £200 if you need to claim for missing days of the cruise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For full details on <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/holidays/article-5624441/How-make-sure-right-travel-insurance-cruise-holiday.html">what to watch out in your cruise insurance</a> see our guide.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. Some insurers say Egypt and Morocco are part of Europe</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not all insurers include the same countries in their cover and some, such as Allianz, class Turkey, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia as part of Europe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Therefore if you're visiting one of these countries, you might not need a worldwide policy and a cheaper European policy may cover you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Always double check – as in some instances Spain is excluded from European insurance – before you buy.</p><img id="i-f4cf6b3c00e5bdbd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/13/4C8E6D8500000578-5766311-image-a-8_1527165529378.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Most travel policies do not cover treatment in private clinics and hospitals" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4. You may not be covered if you're taking to a private hospital</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most travel policies, including those from major providers such as Columbus Direct, the Post Office, Thomas Cook and Insure and Go – do not cover treatment in private clinics and hospitals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It can be hard to tell if a hospital is private or state-run but if you can, check with your insurer first. Last year insurers warned those travelling to Spain, Greece, Cyprus and Turkey to watch out for hotels automatically sending guests to private resorts when they needed treatment, because they received a referral fee for doing so.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also remember if you're going to Europe pack your EHIC as it gives you access to healthcare at the same price a local would pay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The markets are already skittish and I think we will see more volatility to come.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Europe is popular with British investors, who have more than £59billion in funds backing continental firms. But investors, especially those who pick stocks for a living, are questioning whether it remains a good bet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mark Peden, manager of Kames Global Equity Income, said: ‘If you want an easy life, don’t invest in Italian assets for the next few months.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Events such as the Italian crisis tend to weigh heavily on the share prices of all firms, good and bad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But that can create opportunities for investors looking for bargains. However, it is essential that investors opt for quality firms that are insulated from politics and the economy, says Rory Powe, one of the UK’s top European stock pickers and manager of the Man GLG Continental European Growth fund.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says: ‘It is more important than ever to stick to investing in companies of the highest quality where their fortunes rely little on economic growth and much more upon their own specific reasons for success.’</p><img id="i-e2eb17bfc752e2cd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/12/4CD71BD800000578-5796773-image-a-1_1527938060378.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Experts are warning investors to brace for fresh volatility in European stock markets" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">That means avoiding banks, which are heavily reliant on interest rates to make profits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other include real estate firms, whose success is largely tied to the health of the economy, and retailers, which perform well only when people feel flush.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Healthcare, consumer goods, industrial and technology firms are more insulated from economic pressures, Powe says. One of his favourites is SAP, the German software company which has more than 388,000 customers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many investors may feel avoiding Italy is the best idea in the current environment, but that may be overkill.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Powe, for example, holds the Italian luxury clothing brand Moncler and supercar maker Ferrari.

</div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here instead we’ve listed six ways you can boost your broadband signal right now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1. Keep your router away from baby monitors, microwaves and mirrors</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’re using wifi, the nearer you are to the router, the better your connection will be and this can make a big difference to the speed you’re receiving. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Whilst we have all been inclined to lift our phones over our head in pursuit of better receptions, you are less likely to see people picking up their router and waggling it about seeking higher speeds but actually where your router sits can actually have an effect on the signal,’ explains Vix Leyton, spokesperson for Broadband Choices.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She says it’s better to have it higher up and away from anything that might interfere with the signal – think things like baby monitors and microwaves.</p><img id="i-9f10a40066bcbf2a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/16/4C9D34F500000578-5771939-image-a-9_1527260571708.jpg" height="363" width="634" alt="Ethernet cables might be better if your signal's bad because they transmit data faster than wifi" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Try not to surround it by metal objects, and – bizarrely as it may sound – wifi can reflect, so keep them clear of mirrors and reflective surfaces’ she adds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Water can also absorb the signal so if you have a fish tank, for example, keep your router away from it if possible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> <strong>2. Watch out who you give your password to</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The more people who have your wifi password, and use it at the same time, the slower it will be.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you haven’t got a password, or yours is easy to guess, anyone nearby could potentially log onto it and use it for free. Not only could this be a security risk, it means your connection will slow down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you need to set a password, or change your existing one, open your router settings by entering its IP address into your web browser. You'll find the address printed on the router itself somewhere, and it will look like this: 192.168.0.1.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You may need to log in - the admin password and username will also often be printed on the router, but if it isn't, check with your provider for further instructions. From your settings you can then set up or change the password.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. A broadband booster or wifi extender can help</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are a number of different gadgets on sale which claim to boost the speed and reliability of your broadband connection.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, these are designed more for larger homes where there are spots the wifi signal doesn’t reach and won’t actually make a difference to the quality of connection you’re getting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You'll need to plug it in somewhere inbetween your router and the areas of your home where you can't get wifi, or where the signal is weaker, and it will pick up your router's signal and extend it.  </p><img id="i-607b03fb0b7e7eb0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/14/4C8D234500000578-5771939-image-a-1_1527342024187.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="If your wifi is slow it may be worth changing the channel of your router to get a better signal" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4. Try changing the channel of your home network</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If your wifi is slow or continually cuts out, it may be worth changing the channel of your router.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most routers run off the 2.4Ghz frequency spectrum which is made up of several different channels, some of which can be clearer than others.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some routers will automatically switch to different channels, but you could also try manually doing this to improve your signal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How you do this will depend on the type of router you have and there will be instructions in the user manual. For most, it’s a quick job and the following instructions, from Broadbandchoices, show you how to change it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1. First find the best channel using an app like Wifi Analyzer which is free and displays less crowded channels to switch to.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2. Log on to your router, and look for the wireless network settings. Find the prompt that lets you choose a channel, and select the number you want to switch to.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">3. If there's an 'Auto' option, always pick this - the router will do the wireless analytics for you and automatically pick the clearest channel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">4. Wait a few minutes for everything to adjust, and see if your speeds improve.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5. Use an Ethernet cable instead of relying on wifi</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An Ethernet cable is a little old fashioned, and might seem like a step back from using a wireless connection, but it should improve your broadband signal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These cables provide a faster service than wifi because they transmit data at a quicker pace.

Where you position your router is important</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The position of your router can make a big difference to the speed and accuracy of your broadband signal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Therefore try and keep the router in the middle of your home, so its signal can reach every room, and don't shut it away in a cupboard as this can affect the signal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It needs to be visible so if it’s out-of-sight or you’ve put it in a corner of the house away from where you usually are, the speed and distance the wifi can travel will reduce.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other things to watch out for include thick walls, as if the concrete is dense it can dull your broadband signal, while steel joists within the wall can also affect the signal. Also try and avoid placing the router directly next to your window as some of the signal will be sent outside if so. </p><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Switching providers can be a first step to improving your service, but this might not always be possible and doesn’t guarantee your broadband connection will be improved.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>This Is Money</dc:publisher><dc:creator>R Rickardstrauss</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-01T10:14:33.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Six top tips to boosting your broadband </mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-01T10:14:33.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/bills/article-5762569/Going-holiday-cat-gets-sick-Heres-pet-owners-claim-travel-insurance.html" title="Going on holiday and your cat gets sick?

</div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Scott Cargill, UK CEO of Admiral Loans, said: 'For lots of people, getting a car on credit will be their first experience of finance so understanding repayment terms, interest rates and running costs on top of what you might do with your new car in the future can be a lot to take in.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what are the ten most asked questions - and importantly the answers? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you're considering buy a new or used car on finance, you'll want to know this.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">1. What are the different types of car finance? </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are two main types of car finance: Personal Contract Purchase (PCP), which is most popular, and Hire Purchase (HP).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">PCP usually requires buyers to pay a deposit and small monthly payments over two to five years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While many are attracted to the low monthly costs, a balloon payment at the end of the agreement - usually worth thousands of pounds, has to be paid if the drivers wants to keep the car.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This final payment is the estimated value of the vehicle predicted by the finance provider at the start of the agreement, meaning customers are simply paying off the depreciation over time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you don't want to make the payment and keep the car, you can hand it back to the provider.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">HP is simpler - you pay a deposit and higher monthly payments that cover the full cost of the vehicle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There's usually a purchase fee at the end of the deal, which can be as little as £1 in some cases. </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">2. Can I only get car finance from the dealer I buy the vehicle from?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is a common misconception that you can only agree to finance deals offered by dealers selling car.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This misunderstanding can result in customers taking out a loan which isn’t necessarily the best option for them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Customers are free to shop around for car finance deals outside of the car dealership and get quotes before they even step foot in a showroom.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">3. Does shopping around for car finance ruin my credit score?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Making full applications for finance from multiple lenders within a short period of time, whether car finance or otherwise, can set alarm bells ringing for providers and impact on your credit rating. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Therefore, it is recommended that you only do ‘soft credit searches’ when shopping around for quotes until you're absolutely sure the deal and provider is suited to you and you want to make a full application.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once you go past this point you’ll incur a hard credit check against your credit profile.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">4. Will car finance give me a bad credit rating?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having a car finance deal in place and making your repayments on time can actually show other lenders you could be considered a ‘low credit risk’, compared to other people with no credit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, missed or late payments could make you appear as a higher risk to other lenders, so it’s important to choose an affordable deal and to ensure that you make payments on time.</p><img id="i-a19b98f9e688a50e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/15/4C9EE79500000578-5771477-image-a-4_1527257474769.jpg" height="380" width="634" alt="You can pay off the outstanding finance balance early, but it might incur fees" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">5. Can I pay off car finance earlier than agreed?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">You are allowed to you pay off the outstanding balance in full at any time during the course of the agreement and no lender can refuse this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, as with any other type of finance, this can incur some charges or penalties, so it’s best to check what these might be before signing anything.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">6. Are PCPs only available on new cars?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">While it hasn't always been the case, Personal Contract Purchase deals are now available for second hand vehicles.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This gives customers greater flexibility on the type of car they can buy and how they can buy it. Admiral is one of the providers that can draw up a PCP plan for a used car.  </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">7. Do I need to pay a deposit or can I spread the full costs across payments?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">It ultimately depends on the individual lenders.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Deposits are usually requested to ensure that customers borrow a sensible amount in relation to the value of the car, and to reduce the chances of negative equity in the future. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That said, zero deposit finance is becoming increasingly popular with car makers using it as a ploy to attract customers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any provider should give a thorough explanation, plus a list of options available to you, so you can make the choice that best suits you. </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">8. Do I get my deposit back at the end of a PCP agreement?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you decide to hand back the car at the end of the PCP, you are not entitled to any money back - even the deposit. But that doesn't mean you'll miss out.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have paid a large deposit as part of the deal and the depreciation of the car is slower than predicted, the vehicle could be worth more than the final balloon payment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In that case, you could be better off keeping the car, selling it privately and paying off the balloon payment and then have a bit of cash left over.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, that’s a lot of ‘ifs’ and ‘maybes’. Stick to your budget, understand what your balloon payment is likely to be, and only contribute a deposit you can afford. </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">9. How quickly can I get car finance?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some traditional finance providers or car dealers might need written personal details before finding a deal for you, which could take some time. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But these days you can do it all online, which significantly speeds up the process.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You could get a quote from an online provider in less than five minutes and complete an application in the same amount of time.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">10. If my situation changes can I opt out early?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, but only if you've paid off half the value of the total loan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's called a Voluntary Termination (VT) and results in the car being handed back to the finance provider without the customer incurring any fees.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What's most surprising about a VT is that it shouldn't affect your credit score.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, if you do opt out of the deal early, a VT mark is placed against the agreement on your file and could result in lenders refusing to deal with you in the future.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For this reason a VT should be a last resort. Again, motorists are recommended to only take out finance they can afford. </p><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Around four in five new cars in the UK are bought - or acquired at least - using finance rather than motorists purchasing outright.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an experiment run by Starling Bank, identical twins Heidi and Alice, 29, travelled to Berlin for a weekend. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They made exactly the same purchases and both used the same debit card, which charges no extra fees for spending abroad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The only difference was that each time they used their cards, Heidi paid in the local currency, euros, whereas Alice paid in pounds.</p><img id="i-4c6f2a8bbd88596b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/23/4CBD1A8100000578-5784137-image-a-9_1527631865065.jpg" height="419" width="634" alt="Alice (pictured above) and Heidi carried out seven transactions and in each case it was more expensive to pay in pounds " class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-ea42cf788c044836" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/23/4CBCF7D300000578-5784137-image-a-10_1527631869397.jpg" height="486" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">For every transaction, it worked out more expensive to pay in pounds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the worst case, the difference was almost 10 per cent — which means you would lose £100 if you spent £1,000 over the course of your holiday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most restaurants, shops and cash machines overseas give tourists the option to pay in sterling — this is known as dynamic currency conversion. It can be tempting as it means you’ll be able see straight away how much the transaction will cost you in pounds and pence. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the conversion rates used by foreign firms almost always work out as more expensive than if you had paid in the local currency and left it to your own bank or credit card provider to convert the cost.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">UK banks typically use the exchange rate offered by Visa or Mastercard, which is as near to a perfect rate as you can get.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In this experiment, Alice and Heidi, who live in South East London, carried out seven transactions and in each case it was more expensive to pay in pounds. Even in the best cases, the extra cost of paying in pounds was still 3.1 per cent of the total bill.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The worst offender was a cash machine at Berlin airport, where both twins withdrew €200. Heidi chose to be charged in euros, which worked out as £177.44 at the Mastercard exchange rate.</p><img id="i-c2279312a7bf71b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/23/4CBD5A9000000578-5784137-Starling_Bank_s_research_also_showed_that_even_if_your_debit_or_-a-15_1527633985420.jpg" height="344" width="634" alt="The research showed that even if your debit or credit card charges a fee on spending overseas, it would still work out cheaper to pay in the local currency" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alice, on the other hand, accepted the offer to convert the €200 to pounds there and then using the foreign bank’s rate. This ended up costing her £195.18 — an extra £17.74 or 10 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the sisters later split a €43.86 bill for cocktails at their hotel, the difference was far smaller. Heidi paid her €21.93 bill in euros, which worked out at £19.45. Alice paid in pounds, costing her £20.06 — an extra 61p or 3.1 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The next day, the twins went shopping and each bought a scarf, a pair of trainers and a top from three different stores. Heidi paid in euros, spending €7.95, €69.10 and €9.99 — which worked out at £7.05, £61.30 and £8.86 respectively.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alice again converted her bills to pounds and ended up paying £7.28, £63.31 and £9.15. So altogether she paid an extra £2.53.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After lunch — where, unusually, they weren’t offered the option of paying in pounds — they visited the Museum of Berlin, which had a €12 entry fee. Accepting the on-the-spot conversion cost Alice £11.05, while Heidi paid only £10.64.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finally, at the airport the following morning, the twins bought some €12.50 chocolates from a duty-free shop. Heidi, as usual, paid in euros, which later worked out at £11.09. After agreeing to pay in pounds, the chocolates cost Alice £11.70 — an extra 61p or 5.5 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In many of these examples the difference between paying in pounds and euros is just a few pence. But over the course of a holiday this can add up. In fact, the rip-off is estimated to cost British tourists around £500million every year, according to travel money firm FairFX.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the end of the Berlin trip, Alice had spent a total of £317.73 — an extra £21.90 compared to Heidi.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While this isn’t an enormous sum, it is an easy saving to make — all it requires is that you push a different button on the card machine. Experts say that some businesses are failing to give tourists a choice and automatically convert the bill into pounds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman for Starling Bank says: ‘This isn’t always intentional as sometimes shop assistants or waiting staff don’t understand and presume they are doing their customers a favour by selecting to pay in pounds for them. But in line with the law, cardholders should be given a choice before they pay.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Starling Bank’s research also showed that even if your debit or credit card charges a typical 2.99 per cent fee on spending overseas, it would still work out cheaper to pay in the local currency. </p><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>You're about to pay the bill at a restaurant in Europe when up flashes a question on the card machine: do you want to pay in euros or in pounds?

Britain’s biggest insurer says that because Steven suffered a cardiac arrest, not a heart attack, he is not covered and ineligible for the £66,500 payout.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The insurer’s decision left the couple from Lancaster struggling financially. Steven, a self-employed floor layer, has been unable to work since he collapsed. Vicky, a midwife, has been forced to cut back on her shifts in order to care for him. So her income has been reduced, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Vicky, 41, had woken up at 4am after hearing Steven gasping for breath. He collapsed in front of her and, as a trained medical professional, she fortunately knew to start CPR immediately.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The children had to watch as she worked to keep their father alive until paramedics arrived. Without this quick thinking, Steven would almost certainly have died.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It took four defibrillator shocks to get his heart beating. Steven was taken to hospital, where he had a permanent defibrillator fitted around his heart.</p><div>

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It comes after the Mail reported on the case of 50-year-old Juliet Thomas, who was left with a £30,000 medical bill when her insurer voided her travel policy because she had failed to declare that she was taking sleeping tablets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Experts say it is unreasonable for customers to be aware of these types of exclusion when the average home insurance policy length is 20,799 words — roughly the same number as in Lewis Carroll’s classic book Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some home insurance policies are as long as 41,097 words, according to insurance ratings agency Fairer Finance. Car insurance policies can be as long as 38,336 words, and travel insurance up to 39,550.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Martyn James, a consumer expert who has worked for the Financial Ombudsman Service, says: ‘Insurance exists to cover you for the unexpected events that can occur in life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But Money Mail’s investigation has clearly shown that there are countless occasions when unclear or unfair contract terms are used to avoid paying out a claim — this practice undermines the whole industry.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An analysis of cases that went before the independent dispute service for insurance claims, the Financial Ombudsman, found that some insurers refuse to pay out when a burglar has not used ‘force and violence’ to gain entry to the customer’s property.</p><img id="i-9c45e9077139164" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/22/4CBD309700000578-5784197-Some_home_insurance_policies_are_as_long_as_41_097_words_accordi-m-36_1527630229101.jpg" height="356" width="634" alt="Some home insurance policies are as long as 41,097 words, according to insurance ratings agency Fairer Finance. Car insurance policies can be as long as 38,336 words, and travel insurance up to 39,550" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It means that unless thieves break a window or kick down the door, insurers will reject claims — even if the customer had locked the doors and windows and the burglar picked the lock.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In one case last year, Royal &amp; Sun Alliance (RSA) declined a couple’s home insurance claim after police said it was likely the burglars had used a skeleton key to get into the property, leaving no evidence of forced entry.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman for RSA says: ‘In this instance, there was no settlement as the cover terms within the customer’s policy were not met by the claim.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, some insurers refuse claims if customers have the wrong type of locks on windows and doors. In February, for example, one man was refused a payout following a break-in because thieves entered a ground-floor window that was on a latch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His insurer, LV=, claimed he had not complied with the security conditions of his policy, which stated that all his windows must have key-operated locks. A spokesman for LV= says the requirement had been explained verbally and in the customer’s policy documents.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Money Mail’s investigation also found that some motor insurers refuse to pay out if a customer’s car is stolen by a thief posing as a potential buyer, or if the spare key is kept in the car — even if it is locked out of sight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a case referred to the Ombudsman, the thief posing as a buyer had asked the owner of the car if he could take it for a test drive. The owner refused and offered to drive himself.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He later agreed to switch places with the ‘buyer’ but, as soon as he opened the door to get out, the thief made off with the car.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the owner reported the incident to his insurer, Advantage, his claim was rejected. The firm says that the policy excluded cover for ‘loss or damage to your car where possession of it is gained by deception of someone who claims to be a buyer or agent’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Travel insurers, meanwhile, may turn down claims for medical expenses incurred overseas if they don’t think that the treatment was ‘essential’. In one case, a man was told by a doctor that he needed surgery after snapping a tendon in his heel while on holiday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, his insurer, Aviva, said that it didn’t think it was ‘medically necessary’ to have the surgery abroad and wanted to repatriate him back to the UK for treatment. When he went ahead with the operation regardless, Aviva refused to cover the cost.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aviva says that its travel insurance policies only cover treatment overseas if it cannot wait until the customer returns to the UK and that this is detailed in the policy terms and conditions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It adds that it had paid to get the customer home after the surgery. Consumer expert Martyn James says: ‘It isn’t right that customers are expected to challenge a medical professional when they are distressed and in a foreign country where they don’t speak the language.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Travel and health insurers may also refuse claims if they discover customers have not declared GP visits and physio appointments — even if they occurred years ago and the customer was never diagnosed with a condition. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In one case seen by the Ombudsman, a man was refused cover after he was admitted to hospital with severe back pain caused by an extruded disc hernia. Axa discovered that he had been to his GP with back and leg pain two months prior to travelling.</p><img id="i-999a228a2de43a67" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/06/4CBD476A00000578-5784565-Travel_insurers_may_turn_down_claims_for_medical_expenses_incurr-a-1_1527658105934.jpg" height="380" width="634" alt="Travel insurers may turn down claims for medical expenses incurred overseas if they don’t think that the treatment was ‘essential’" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet, despite the fact that he was only told to take over-the-counter medication and to self-refer for physiotherapy, Axa said he was not covered for claims arising from any medical condition for which he’d been prescribed medication or received treatment within six months of booking the trip.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the Ombudsman said that it was not reasonable for Axa to expect the customer to notify his insurer of the GP visit when he had not experienced a significant change in health. Axa says it accepted the ruling and has paid the claim.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some travel insurers also try to reject claims where the customer has had alcohol, even though the incident was unrelated. And others will use completely unrelated health issues or injuries to avoid paying out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In one instance, a woman had failed to declare a trip to the GP about pins and needles 14 years before she was being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When she made a claim on her critical illness policy, her insurer, Prudential, turned it down on the grounds of ‘non-disclosure’, as pins and needles can be an early symptom of the condition. But the insurer was later ordered by the Ombudsman to pay out. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prudential says it is ‘extremely rare’ for it not to pay a critical illness claim and adds that it is sorry for the distress caused. James Daley, founder of Fairer Finance, says: ‘It seems that, as the pressure to set fairer prices increases, insurers are trying to reduce costs by wriggling out of as many claims as possible. Examples such as these, where insurers reject claims on a technicality, are toxic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Firms should be forced to flag major exclusions in big red letters before customers sign up.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman for industry trade body the Association of British Insurers says: ‘Insurers want to pay all claims and continually strive to make all customer communications as clear and simple as possible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Insurance is ultra-competitive and, when shopping around, it is vital that people assess their needs and check the cover to ensure that it best meets their requirements.’ </p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Vicky and Steven Huddleston took out critical illness insurance to cover their mortgage in the event that one of them became ill.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">To defuse this so-called interest-only timebomb, the City watchdog introduced new rules in March which allow banks to relax lending criteria for older borrowers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the past, banks required customers to prove they could, in theory, afford a more expensive repayment mortgage where you pay back some of the capital as well as interest each month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For many borrowers this was impossible because banks only allowed them a mortgage term up to their 65th or 70th birthday. As the repayments due were spread over such a short period, borrowers would have faced monthly bills for thousands of pounds, which they could not afford.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Under the new Financial Conduct Authority rules, customers may need to show only that they can meet interest-only repayments.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In addition, banks are increasing their lending age limits. Currently, around one-third of building societies offer mortgages to people aged over 80, according to Moneyfacts. Some will even lend to customers aged up to 99.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Hodge Lifetime deal, launched last week, is for borrowers aged 55 and over who have at least 40 per cent equity in their home.It allows them to continue making interest-only payments indefinitely.

But you will need to meet its affordability checks and provide proof of reliable income stream.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hodge offers a five-year deal at 3.99 per cent and a two-year rate at 3.59 per cent, plus a £995 fee. On a typical £150,000 loan the monthly payments would be £498 or £449, respectively.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the end of the fixed term you are moved to Hodge’s standard variable rate, currently 4.45 per cent. Hodge also offers a two-year variable deal at 3.44 per cent. But typical payments of £429 will increase if interest rates rise. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Hodge mortgage will be available from June 11 through brokers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nationwide announced last week that it plans to offer a similar interest-only retirement deal, though details have not been revealed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aldermore Bank has launched a range of mortgages targeted at homeowners aged over 55, including interest-only deals. It will let you borrow until age 99.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Interest-only customers must have at least 40 per cent equity and pay a £999 fee.Its two-year rate is 3.38 per cent and five-year rate 3.68 per cent. On a £150,000 loan, monthly repayments are £422 or £460, respectively.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aldermore also offers a capital and repayment deal for older borrowers who may want to remortgage to fund retirement costs or offer help to family. Customers pay 25 per cent as a downpayment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The two-year rate is 3.68 per cent and five-year rate 3.98 per cent, at a cost for such a typical loan of £765 or £790 a month.Loughborough Building Society offers interest-only mortgages and repayment deals to the over-70s. You need 40 per cent equity and can borrow up to £350,000 for 25 years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its three-year discount rate is currently 3.19 per cent, or £399 a month interest-only on a £150,000 loan. The rate will remain at 1.9 percentage points below the building society’s SVR, currently 5.09 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 2.89 per cent capital repayment deal works out at £703 a month. The fee is £99. The rate will remain at 2.2 percentage points below SVR.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Family Building Society also recently increased its borrowing age limit, to 95.

The deal is fee-free.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Say you want to buy a property worth £200,000 using the deal, you would take a mortgage for £180,000 on the 4.98 per cent five-year fixed rate plus a £20,000 interest-free loan secured against your parent or relative's home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On a standard 25-year term, your monthly repayments for the first five years would be £1,050 a month for the mortgage repayment plus £333 for the 10 per cent deposit loan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Overall, to qualify for the deal you'll have to be able to demonstrate that you can afford to repay £1,383 a month. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Because the deposit loan is secured against a relative's property, both properties are at risk of being repossessed by the bank if you fail to keep up with your payments.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For this reason, it's probably a good idea to get separate legal advice on the implications.  </p><div>

Homeowners who currently have a Nationwide mortgage can apply to borrow a bit more and then gift this money to a relative to use as a cash deposit for their own purchase.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In order to qualify, both borrowers must get their mortgage from Nationwide and it's not restricted to first-time buyers. Rates start at 1.39 per cent for the two-year tracker and 1.69 per cent for the two-year fixed rate. A five-year fix is 2.09 per cent.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Barclays offers a Family Springboard mortgage that allows first-time buyers to leverage their parents' savings to help them purchase a home. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This deal allows borrowers to take a 100 per cent LTV loan if family or loved ones can provide 10 per cent of the property’s price - in cash held with the bank - as security.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its rate is fixed at 2.69 per cent for three years, is fee-free and your family gets their savings back after three years with interest as long as you keep up the repayments.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aldermore Bank,  Harpenden Building Society and Family Building Society also offer versions of a family mortgage.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">This is Money Verdict </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The best option depends on each individual’s financial circumstance, so to work out which is right for you, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/mortgage-finder">speak to an independent mortgage broker</a> who can advise you on all of the available options and choose the best one for your circumstances.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Andrew Montlake, of mortgage broker Coreco, said: ‘When you’re comparing options, the key is to get proper advice since there is a lot of choice out there.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But that said, too many lenders say they listen to clients and then ignore their actual requirements, so it is great to see the Post Office being really innovative and delivering products that actually meet their customers' needs.'</p><div class="moduleFull"><div class="item tim/tim_calc_mortgage_cost_wrapper">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">As the starting point for electric cars being accepted as real cars, the Nissan Leaf has quite a pedigree, but 2011 was a long time ago and the competition has been charging ahead. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Which is why Nissan has launched this heavily revised version, going up against an e-Golf that itself was revised last year, and the Renault Zoe that always make a lot of sense on everything from practicality to cost.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All three of the models we've tested are half the price of the cheapest Tesla you can buy in the UK right now, so while they might not necessarily be 'affordable' to all they are much less demanding of your bank balance. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But which one is the best?

But for how far? That’s always the question, and we’ve learnt to take with a bucket of salt the official range figures. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nissan claims 235 miles between charges. Right. At least Renault gives a real-world figure of 174 miles in the summer, falling to 112 in the winter. We applaud such honesty, although VW does something similar and gives a real-world figure of 125 miles.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We actually tested them for real in the winter, under normal driving conditions and we achieved only 93 miles in the e-Golf and 108 miles in the Leaf, but the Zoe zoomed on to 131 miles.</p><img id="i-766280f25a54bf2e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/11/16/4B0D352B00000578-5603791-image-a-70_1523461631329.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="The Nissan Leaf, in its previous guise, has been the UK's most-bought pure electric car.

It could take seven carry-on cases, whereas the other two could manage six. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Actually that’s quite an achievement for the Zoe since it’s easily the smallest car here by a margin. Rear passenger space is consequently the least here, although it’s not bad, and to have the same luggage capacity as the e-Golf is a pleasant surprise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s no great surprise though to see that the Renault isn’t overly endowed with kit, but the downer is the dearth of safety kit – automatic emergency braking isn’t available even as an option. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Nissan Leaf adds the most standard equipment, and goes big on safety kit which is a reassuring thing to see.</p><img id="i-9f2ca3d9715c52b9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/11/16/4B0D354600000578-5603791-image-a-53_1523460682061.jpg" height="259" width="306" alt="Renault Zoe" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-229ef2020259aac4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/11/16/4B0D353A00000578-5603791-image-a-52_1523460636683.jpg" height="259" width="306" alt="The Renault Zoe boot capacity matches the Volkswagen" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-d688670251381ff0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/11/16/4B0D350A00000578-5603791-image-a-55_1523460693291.jpg" height="282" width="306" alt="For occupants the VW scores the most points and serves up a perfectly adequate boot" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-7c18506fc0ed0e3c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/11/16/4B0D351200000578-5603791-image-a-56_1523460704810.jpg" height="282" width="306" alt="VW e-Golf" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-2ee9c1b4b62d0dca" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/11/16/4B0D352200000578-5603791-image-a-57_1523460712814.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="The Leaf offers the most luggage space of our trio tested with plenty of room for a couple of large suitcases" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">These three all qualify for the lowest benefit-in-kind tax rate but, thanks to the vagaries of government, this has increased to 13 per cent as of April and will rise to 16 per cent next year before plunging to 2 per cent. Go figure. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the short term that means these won’t be much cheaper to tax than a VW Polo with a petrol engine. However, if you do 10,000 miles a year you’re looking at an electricity bill of £400 to £500, which doesn’t seem bad at all, and you could get that down further with night time cheaper charging.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you drive into London and its increasing charges then this makes sense, but if you don’t you’d need to do a lot of miles as a private driver before the costs started to work in your favour. </p><img id="i-1e2d946e4f8840f9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/11/16/4B0D352600000578-5603791-image-a-41_1523460217617.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Our winner is the Nissan Leaf.

If you’re after the most 'car-like' experience, with a bit of premium thrown in, then it’s the VW e-Golf for you. If you want cheap and cheerful with a certain fun factor and a decent range, then the Renault Zoe would be your choice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If we had to choose we’d go for the Nissan Leaf. It’s the least compromised, has very decent performance, comes well equipped, including with safety equipment, and it will be cheap to run. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back in 2011 this was the

The deal offered borrowers an equity loan equal to up to 20 per cent of the value of the property interest-free for five years. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In London, the scheme was even more generous, affording borrowers an interest-free equity loan of up to 40 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It meant homeowners had to find just 5 per cent in savings for a deposit, while mortgage lenders would fund the remaining 75 per cent (or 55 per cent in London) with a mortgage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This had an added advantage: the bigger the deposit, the lower the mortgage rate tends to be.</p><img id="i-9f9a2ee53ac922f1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/06/15/0589599A00000514-5423427-image-a-3_1523025633870.jpg" height="385" width="634" alt="Almost 150,000 households have taken advantage of the Help to Buy equity loan scheme" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Help to Buy loans were available on new build properties only, with a maximum value of £600,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since launch, almost 150,000 households have taken advantage of the scheme, with over £7billion lent out by the Government in five years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But this month, the first of those using the scheme will see their monthly outgoings rise as the first interest payments become due.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More than 10,000 borrowers took an interest-free loan towards their deposit in April 2013 - and they will have to start paying interest on their equity loan at a rate of 1.75 per cent. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This rate will start going up by retail price inflation (currently 3.6 per cent) each year from 12 months after they make their first interest payment.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">What happens if you keep the Help to Buy loan?  </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">When you reach the end of the first five years, you'll have to start paying interest on the equity loan. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This will be charged at 1.75 per cent in the sixth year. On a £40,000 Help to Buy loan this equates to £700 a year or £58.33 a month.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From the seventh year, this rate will rise annually by the Retail Price Index, currently 3.6 per cent, plus another 1 per cent. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This will be payable monthly on top of your regular mortgage payments to your lender and you should note that you are only paying the interest - not the capital.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The allure of such investments is easy to understand. For one, they typically cost less than actively managed propositions. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Active managers earn their corn by attempting to beat their benchmark market index by cherry-picking stocks and chopping and changing them to take advantage of perceived inefficiencies in the market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, trying to beat the index  comes at a cost. Cash spent on the latest investment research and footing the salaries of the investment team - fund manager included - inflate the cost of active management.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This extra cost layer does not apply to passive propositions, which are essentially run by a computer algorithm and will buy all or the majority of the assets within the index they track.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What's more, with active investments, there is no guarantee that they will perform better than the market. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, a school of thought argues that the odds are stacked against actives over the long-run as market indices tend to be more broadly diversified and are therefore better shielded against economic cycles.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Put simply, you can pay more for an active which may or may not beat the market or you can pay less for a tracker which won't beat the market but should match it. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But with so many options on offer, how do you choose the best trackers to invest in this Isa season? We've asked two experts in passive investments to give their top picks.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">The experts' top picks </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Peter Sleep, senior investment manager at Seven Investment Management</strong>, said investors should always aim put their cash in regulated 'UCITS' funds - which have stringent safeguards for investors in place. He outlined his top picks below.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>UK Equity - </strong></strong><strong><strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="https://www.lyxoretf.lu/en/instit/resources/documents/factsheets/rfact_lu1781541096_en_20180309_lux">Lyxor Core Morningstar UK ETF</a></strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong><strong>Ongoing charges: 0.04 per cent</strong><strong></strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Lyxor Core Morningstar UK ETF is a new fund which  launched this month. It costs 0.04 per cent, which is as cheap as chips.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A broad-based UK equity fund is the core building block for any investor. The ETF has 337 stocks and  a good combination of large international companies and smaller UK-orientated companies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>UK Equity Income - </strong></strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://webfund6.financialexpress.net/clients/dailymail/FundFactsheet.aspx?CitiCode=FPC7"><strong><strong>Vanguard UK Equity Income</strong></strong></a></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ongoing charges: 0.22 per cent</strong></p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I'm a fan of the Vanguard UK Equity Income Fund priced at 0.22 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is a tracker fund rather than an ETF, although they are very, very similar. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some caution is needed with UK equity income funds because you can end up biased towards quite volatile stocks. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Vanguard fund is nicely balanced and has a decent yield of about 4.9 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Global Equity - <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://webfund6.financialexpress.net/clients/dailymail/FundFactsheet.aspx?CitiCode=K41J">Vanguard Global Small-Cap Index</a></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ongoing charges: 0.40 per cent</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Again another tracker fund from Vanguard. The Global Small-cap Index fund priced at 0.38 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This invests in over 4,300 smaller companies from around the developed world. Historically smaller companies grow faster and show better returns than larger companies that may often have grown to their limit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ethical ETF - </strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://webfund6.financialexpress.net/clients/dailymail/FundFactsheet.aspx?CitiCode=OCQH"><strong><strong>UBS ETF MSCI ACWI Socially Responsible UCITS ETF</strong></strong></a></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ongoing charges: 0.48 per cent</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is an increasing number of ethical ETFs, but I am going to go for UBS ETF MSCI ACWI Socially Responsible UCITS ETF. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is an 'all countries' ETF, so it covers both 47 developed markets and emerging markets, but not frontier markets (defined as smaller illiquid stock markets where investor protections are poor). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This ETF scores every company on various ethical, social and governance standards and then kicks out sectors with a negative social or environmental impact like gambling or alcohol. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ETF costs 0.48 per cent. To reduce the risk of investing abroad this ETF is hedged into sterling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Bond ETF: </strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPFB:GR"><strong><strong>SPDR Barclays Global Aggregate Bond UCITS ETF</strong></strong></a></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ongoing charges: 0.10 per cent</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The SPDR Barclays Global Aggregate Bond UCITS ETF  GBP hedged costs 0.1 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the long-term, the king of investments is equities, but we know they can be very volatile and they are not for everyone, so more cautious investors hold bonds and accept a lower return for a less bumpy investment ride.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This ETF invests in high grade government and corporate bonds, what we call 'supranationals', like the World Bank, and high-grade emerging market bonds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finally it is all hedged into  sterling to reduce risk further.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You get all that for the bargain basement price of 0.1 per cent. With 21,000 bonds in the index the ETF is highly diversified and SPDR have to work really hard for you.</p><div class="moduleFull"><div class="money item">

They are structured like a company, with shares that trade on the stock market and invest in a basket of shares, bonds or property. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are known as closed-ended as the number of shares or units trading in the trust  is limited and finite.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Investment trusts can be riskier than unit trusts because their shares can trade at a premium or discount to the value of the assets they hold, known as the net asset value. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unlike closed ended-funds - also sometimes called unit trusts - investment trusts are also allowed to raise debt in order to fund investment. This means when markets perform well their investment returns are geared and can outperform the market. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It also exposes investors to risk however, as debt-funded investment can result in bigger losses if markets fall. </p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trusts have won plaudits among many investors over their performance. In the 11 months to the end of November 2017, the share price of the average investment company grew 14 per cent, according to the Association of Investment Companies figures.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In addition, fees for investment trusts tend to be lower than funds, which means your returns are not as affected by charges. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What's more, as trusts are  closed ended, meaning there is a fixed amount of shares, unlike in a fund where you risk having your returns diluted if more people invest or if a whole load of people try to sell out their holding.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But with more than 300 investment companies to choose from, it is difficult to whittle the options down to those  best suited to you.

It’s no more complicated than Dragon’s Den – fund managers try and pick companies which they think will grow, make money and turn decent profits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shares are the most volatile type of mainstream investment and can jump up and down in value a lot. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bonds (basically IOUs from Governments and companies which pay investors some income for their loans) are typically the more bland investment cousin and can be used by investors to turn the rollercoaster into a more sedate ride.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’re investing for the very long-term you may want to only choose shares. If you want to smooth out the peaks and trough, you will want to use some bonds as well and for this, a so-called ‘multi-asset’ fund is your easiest option to investigate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" class="class" href="/money/investing/article-4367938/50-best-funds-investment-trusts.html">&gt; Essential reading: 50 of the best funds and investment trusts </a></p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">How much could you make? </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your third question is probably going to be about numbers. How much could I make?

Well the FTSE 100 fell by nearly 30 per cent in 2008 but made the vast majority of this back in 2009.

</div>
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">This will mean some customers are slapped with an increase of £30 a year from April.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stephen van Rooyen, Sky UK's chief executive, said: ‘Not all customers will see their bills increase with many Sky products remaining at their current price and, for some products, this will be the first increase in two years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We continue to invest in content, products and services that our customers love, offering both new and existing customers great value and more choice through flexible packages.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>There are no changes to some services</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How do you know if your bill will jump?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sky is writing to customers impacted by the changes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those who don’t get an email or letter from the provider detailing the increase in cost before March 23 are not affected.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>So can you avoid it?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The all-important question is, can you avoid the hikes?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This depends on what services you have with Sky and whether you are within a minimum contract. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to uSwitch research, one in three broadband customers is out of contract – i.e they are on a monthly rolling deal after their original 12 or 24-month contract ended.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you sit in this camp of Sky customers the good news is you can switch to a better deal without penalty. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If are are cancelling you will need to give a minimum 31 days’ notice to end a Sky TV service while for Broadband and Sky Talk it's 14 days.</p><img id="i-48927c7cbcbb28af" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/23/12/4983FEB600000578-0-image-a-3_1519387687359.jpg" height="290" width="634" alt="Box Sets: Customers will pay £1.50 more for the bundle from Sky from April 1" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Broadband and phone customers can leave mid contract</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sky Talk and Broadband customers can leave without penalty.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But to do this you must get in touch with the company and cite the price increase as your reason for leaving within 30 days of receiving your letter or email notification on the hike.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remember you can’t up sticks in this way until you actually receive your notification though.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>TV customers won’t be able to switch mid-contract for free, but you may be able to haggle</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unfortunately if you are mid contract on a Sky TV deal you won’t be able to switch without penalty.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This means paying out the rest of your contract.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even if you're still tied into a contract though it may be worth calling Sky up to see if you can negotiate a slightly cheaper deal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Currently those who ring up can sign up to its new Sky Entertainment for £20 per month if they sign up to a new contract.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The best deals are typically offered to new customers online so a quick search of rival offers and the price Sky charges a new customer can put you in a better position to argue your case as a loyal customer.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">You may be paying for services you never use so it may also be worth reviewing your contract to see if you could cut your bills by ditching costly extras.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>So what are the cheapest broadband deals to switch?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If its just a cheap broadband connection you are after there are a whole host of deals available costing less than £20 per

At that point, the Department for Work and Pensions will perform two calculations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first is to work out how much state pension you would have got under the ‘old’ rules.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is a basic state pension of roughly £122 per week for those with 30 years or more in the system, plus an earnings-related ‘SERPS’ pension depending on how much you earned and whether or not you were ‘contracted out’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The second calculation is how much you would be entitled to under the ‘new’ system.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In this case it would be a full state pension of around £160 per week for those with 35 years in the system, minus an (often large) deduction for any past period of contracting out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your pension as at 6 April 2016 is based on the *higher of these two amounts*. This is called your ‘starting amount’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The good news for someone in the situation that you describe is that if they had already built up a state pension in excess of the flat rate figure of £160 per week – which could even be as much as £200 per week – then that will indeed be the basis for their final pension.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS money" data-version="2" id="mol-24b2b0e0-05da-11e8-a610-e31b3fde6b0f">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">How to check your state pension forecast </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Government's online service is <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/check-your-state-pension">here.</a> Details of how to apply by phone or post are <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-state-pension">here.</a></p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The only thing that has changed for them is that any years they work from 2016/17 onwards will no longer add any more to their state pension – it is effectively capped at the level built up by 2016, apart from annual inflation increases.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For those whose April 2016 starting figure is below the flat rate of £160 per week, they can still add to their starting amount by years of contributions from 16/17 onwards until they reach the flat rate.

They are both backed with millions in venture capital funding. Visit coinbase.com/signup and blockchain.info to find out more.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, it only deals with the most familiar digital currencies - if you want to invest in an obscure one, it is much harder (as we explain below). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another popular wallet is Electrum, which is a wallet for desktop computer use. </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">BUY AT AN EXCHANGE </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once you have set up your wallet, you add cryptocurrency to it. You find an exchange and send them cash, either by bank transfer or credit/debit card to obtain digital currency. Bank transfer tends to be the cheaper method.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, Coinbase charges 3.99 per cent on debit and credit transactions, or 1.49 per cent for a standard buy/sell.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many have strict requirements for ID purposes. A handy website is Bittybot, which lets you compare brokers and fees, alongside user ratings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Two of the most popular brokers are Coinify and Coinbase, mentioned above. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, a firm called London Block Exchange, based in Canary Wharf, is soon to launch, allowing people to buy and spend five online currencies - bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, monero and ripple - which will be linked to a Visa debit card.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you buy bitcoin, for example, you will need to hand over your unique key. This is an identifier that represents your account and is different from your wallet log-in. It should be easy to find within the details of your account.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brokers will ask for this address to make a transaction. When it comes to selling, there should be no issue selling a mainstream coin such as bitcoin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can use the same broker you bought it from and it will involve them giving you an other key to send your bitcoin too from your wallet. Once the transaction is confirmed, you should receive your cash. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remember, some of these exchanges can crash unexpectedly. For instance, Kraken, the fifth largest cryptocurrency exchange, was out of service for two days earlier in the month after scheduled maintenance that was supposed to take two hours. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It left many nervy investors wondering if they'd be able to cash out, if they so wished. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is also possible to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through some existing trading platforms, where you actually own the coins themselves. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One popular website which advertises heavily is eToro. We've seen adverts on the London Underground and even on easyJet flight boarding passes. Its system works similar to a DIY investing platform's nominee account system, eToro holds the cryptocurrencies and you have a claim on those that you have bought. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Previously the platform used contracts for difference for crypto, but it no longer does. </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-926e3a90-01c6-11e8-ac74-d33834489f7b">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">I BOUGHT €4K OF RIPPLE ON BITSTAMP</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">One This is Money reader, Alex – who only wants his first name mentioned – invested €1,600 in ripple last June, a further €1,600  at the start of December and a further €1,000 over Christmas.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He chose ripple after a friend-of-a-friend recommendation from an IT consultant with a keen interest in cryptocurrencies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says that they had used an exchange called Gatehub.

It took a week to get verified, which involved him sending a copy of passport to the Bitstamp HQ in Slovenia, along with a bank transfer, which meant having his Iban and Swift Code to hand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says that recently, a friend of his has also tried to sign up with Bitstamp, but the company is quoting five weeks to verify, thanks to a surge of interest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says his June investment saw ripple at $0.22 a coin, but this fell to $0.10 not long afterwards, testing his nerve at the very beginning.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eventually it rose and he was confident to make another investment, in December, when the coin went to $0.38 a coin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By mid-January, it raced to a record high near $4 a coin – and Alex said his account had grown to €34,000 (it's measured in euros as it is Slovenian based) from roughly €4,000 invested.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said on one train journey home, his account had collapsed from €34,000 to €25,000, as investors began to panic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He believes the price went up after rumours that ripple was heading to Coinbase, one of the main crypto players, meaning more people could invest, thus driving up the price.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the firm issued a statement saying this wasn't the case - and it lead to a bloodbath.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, was it easy to cash out? Alex says it was. He sold 8,000XRP making a tidy profit and taking away his exposure. This was sold within seconds on the site to eager investors.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has left him with 12,000XRP that he plans to keep hold of. Currently, it has 'stabilised' to around $1.15 a coin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He says Bitstamp charge 0.24 per cent for buying and selling. The cost, he says, of selling, was €9 in fees. It was also warned that it would take up to three working days to arrive in his account. It took two.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We asked whether his bank had been in touch regarding any suspicious activity, giving the amounts of money being transferred and having been received overseas. He says he hasn't.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A raft of case studies recently in the <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ft.com/content/cd13cdce-fa12-11e7-9b32-d7d59aace167">Financial Times</a> revealed problems cashing out their profits, with some banks suspicious of where customers had received huge sums. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Transferring cash and passport details to Slovenia for an investment punt is extreme - but Alex says the risk has paid dividends.</p>                            </div>                        </div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">CFDS</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some websites offer investors the chance to take a punt on cryptocurrencies, but not actually own any of their own. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, you buy 'Contract For Difference' agreements. This is where an investor and a broker agree to pay each other the difference between the price of an asset at the moment the contract is made and its later price when you decide to close it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Financial Conduct Authority warned against betting on the currency using CFDs in November.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are complex financial instruments which allow novice investors to guess whether the price will go up or down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Punters could lose up to 50 times their deposit if they get it wrong, meaning they could rapidly rack up huge debts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The FCA said CFD traders are 'at risk of suffering significant losses and potentially losing more than you have invested'. </p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">OBSCURE COINS HARDER TO BUY</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many may believe bitcoin may have peaked – or reached a point in which they cannot make some of the astronomical gains made by early investors.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As such, they want to take a 'punt' on a lesser known coin. There is plenty of them. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is Money recently signed up to New Zealand based website Cryptopia to see a list of what is available. It was huge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Two that are being tipped to grow this year from a low level by a panel of four fintech leaders for price comparison website Finder in a cryptocurrency predictions survey are cardano (ADA) and stellar lumens (XLM).</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">They claim that cardano – a third generation digital currency - will rise by more than 8,000 per cent this year from $0.78 a coin to $68.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, getting your mitts on the coin as a speculative punt is not as easy as it seems. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hardly any of the aforementioned brokers or wallets cater for the smaller currencies, only the main players such as bitcoin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You then find yourself on niche websites – or in our case, Cryptopia. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But to buy any currency on many of these types of website requires you to already own bitcoin or another major cryptocurrency. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Or in Alex's case above, sending bank and passport details to Slovenia, which is a hurdle many - understandably - would not be comfortable with.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When we searched 'how to buy cardano UK' a step-by-step guide said we needed to download software for the wallet and own ethereum to get the coin. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We're not sure how many people would be comfortable downloading software onto their computers or phones from sources they do not know.

Here's how they compare.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-28f9fb60-c54b-11e7-8446-e978840acc19">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU BUY</h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While mobile card readers are clever tool, the trade-off is they often charge higher fees than dedicated payment processing companies, and not all merchants accept payments over the phone and online.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They also rely on Wifi or mobile phone reception to work so if you're trading out in the sticks or anywhere else with a limited signal, you'll need to ensure you have an ample cash stockpile for when coverage is patchy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Featured on our list of the best card readers are <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="http://izettle.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=6&amp;aff_id=23653">iZettle</a>, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/credit-card-reader">PayPal Here</a>, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="https://squareup.com/t/f_content/p_mailonline/l_gb?route=signup/gb%3Fsignup_token%3D2E5D68CD">Square</a> and <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="https://sumup.com/#a_aid=5a00950b2b5e4">Sum Up Air</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Users of these devices aren't required to sign a contract, so they can use them for as long or short a period as they like.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The card readers also allow merchants to send receipts via email or SMS but receipt printers are extra. So if your customer doesn't have an email address or mobile number, or if you don't fancy shelling out on a compatible printer (which can cost north of £100), the only option you're left with is writing one by hand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What's more, they all offer an accompanying point of sale app allowing you to track real-time sales data, for example, at no extra cost - although some are more elaborate than others. SumUp Air for example offers a basic point of sale app as standard but users can upgrade to a 'complete' solution which provides a re-configured iPad, an iPad stand, a receipt printer, a cash drawer and a Wi-Fi router. This, however, will incur a fixed monthly cost.</p></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>This list is in no particular order<span style="font-size: 22.4px; letter-spacing: -0.224px;">.

The 2.75 per cent transaction fee is steep too - although it does fall to 1.5 per cent if your monthly transactions are greater than £15,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The highs: </strong><span class="">PayPal is an instantly recognisable and a trusted brand, therefore, the reader may make merchant seem more credible.

It also allows customers to add a tip directly on the card reader, which could be of particular benefit for businesses in the hospitality industry.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The lows:</strong> Many SMEs are likely to be burnt by the higher transaction fee band. In addition, while PayPal can credit funds to your PayPal account instantly, there can be restrictions on accessing these funds depending on your business and its activities. This could cause cashflow problems.

PayPal Here is the most expensive overall.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While all four featured readers have no fixed contract or monthly fees and no required transaction volumes, the transaction fees range from 1.69 per cent to 2.75 per cent. The figures are even higher for payments where the card is not present.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, the device cost is between £39 plus VAT for Square and £62.50 plus VAT for PayPal Here (once the iZettle and PayPal Here promotions expire at the end of November).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That said, cost isn't everything. It is important to look under the bonnet of each proposition to find out whether they align to the needs of your business.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All four devices accept Visa, MasterCard and Amex cards but it is worth double checking if there are other card types you think you need to accept, according to Stephen Hart from Cardswitcher.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You also need to check if the device is compatible with your smartphone/tablet, and, crucially, how long it takes before the card payments you take will be transferred into your accounts. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Emma Jones from Enterprise Nation says: 'In the early days of card readers, the money took many days or even a week to trickle into you bank account. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Today there is no need to wait more than a day, two tops. This is also helpful for cash flow. It also saves you having to take a lot of cash home with you and then count it into bundles and bags and take it to the bank when it opens the next day.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In addition, it is probably worth paying that little bit extra on a device that not only facilitates card payments but boasts features that can help drive up sales.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hart adds: 'The biggest difference between devices is probably the reporting/ analytics tools on offer to help you run your business - these are now very sophisticated but do vary so check what's on offer from each for your business needs. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'All the websites have great videos showcasing their functionality. Finally, there's integration - some devices seamlessly integrate with popular accounting packages such as <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.xero.com/uk/?utm_source=Affiliate&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=spreadsheets">Xero</a>.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-large"><strong>Traditional card terminals could still be the best solution </strong> </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While mobile card readers have been a positive addition to the payment options available to merchants, traditional terminals should not be overlooked.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes devices are still pretty pricey. Terminal hire is typically levied between £15 and £20 a month - but can be up to £40 - and you can face another a minimum monthly charge if your transaction volume isn’t high enough.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So for the smallest of merchants who take occasional take card payments, they may well be too expensive. But transaction rates have reduced significantly in the past 18 months, Hart says, adding: 'While the cheapest card reader option will charge a 1.69 per cent transaction fee, a traditional terminal package could be as low as 0.3 per cent for debit cards and 0.8 per cent for credit cards. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When we do the maths, we estimate that the traditional terminals start to become cheaper overall at a monthly transaction volume of around £2,200 (£26,400 per year), which isn’t that high. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So even if a mobile card reader is best for your business now, keep an eye on the costs as your business grows - at card payment turnover of around £50,000 per year, the mobile card readers are twice as expensive as traditional terminals.'</p><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>To maximise profits made during the peak Christmas trading season, small businesses - especially pop-ups - need to take card payments to maximise sales.

One is via 'mining', which is a system that allows computer users to calculate complex algorithms required to verify each transaction in the blockchain and be rewarded with bitcoins.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The second way is to use a bitcoin exchange to purchase bitcoins with a real world currency such a sterling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If someone is mining bitcoins then HMRC regards this as a trade and will charge any profits to income tax and national insurance. Income and expenses would need to be calculated in sterling each year with the profits reported to HMRC and tax duly paid. Any expenses claimed would need to relate solely and specifically to the trade of mining.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the bitcoins have been purchased HMRC will regard any increase in value as being liable to capital gains tax.

Firstly, you could switch your energy supplier if you're not already on the cheapest tariff available to you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You say your bills have increased this year which means you must be on a standard tariff. These are typically the most expensive available and therefore by switching to a fixed-rate tariff, whereby the price you pay for energy is set, you are likely to save. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There may also be other changes which could help keep your home warmer for longer, and cutting down the time you need the electric heater to be on.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">These include; extending your central heating system and radiators to all areas of your home, replacing older appliances with energy-efficient versions, making sure any gaps around your windows or under the door frame are filled to avoid cold air getting in, having your windows double glazed, or having insulation fitted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While these changes may be expensive upfront, they’re likely to cut your bills in the long term and therefore may be worthwhile.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A new gas boiler, for example, will typically cost around £2,300 plus the cost of the radiators, but you could cut the cost of your heating bill by nearly half and save by around £560 a year, according to the EST.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are also several schemes for getting free energy saving measures.

To raise funds, it offers bonds that pay between 3.9 per cent and 8 per cent a year. The payouts come from interest LCF charges on its loans.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are three options — a one-year bond paying 3.9 per cent, a two-year at 6.5 per cent and three-year paying 8 per cent. The minimum investment is £5,000 and you cannot access your money during the fixed period.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">THE RISKS: LCF insists that companies put up property or other assets as security in case they can’t pay. However, you could take a hit if a company defaults.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">LCF says it has repaid all interest and capital to investors since 2012.

Why not the Logan MCV estate? We don't know.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The savings are pretty small - £2,000 off a Duster SUV and £500 clipped from the RRP of the Sandero supermini - but considering their low purchase prices in the first instance, the discounts are actually a good percentage of the overall cost. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-underline">Ford - </span></strong><strong><span class="mol-style-underline">extended deal now expires on 31 March 2018</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ford is being generous with the range of petrol and diesel cars you can choose from, though they're all subject to different discounts (just to make it a little more confusing).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For instance, the scrappage saving when you want a new Fiesta is just £2,000, but you can save £4,950 on a high-spec Focus if you trade-in your Euro4-or-earlier motor.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other models include the B-MAX (excluding Zetec, with a £3,500 saving), C-MAX (up to £4,700 saving), Kuga (up to £4,850 saving) and various Transit models with a maximum discount of £7,000.

With that, you get the brand's market-leading seven-year warranty. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-underline">Mazda - new car needs to be registered by 31 March 2018 to qualify </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mazda's scheme is available on a select few models, though the restriction is that any new vehicle you buy has to emit less than 130g/km of CO2. The Japanese brand is also offering bigger discounts on models with diesel engines than those with petrols, seemingly in a push to clear stock of oil burners.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Models and savings: Mazda2 (petrol only with £2,500 discount), Mazda3 (petrol models offer a £4,000 discount and diesel £5,000), Mazda 6 (petrol models offer a £4,000 discount and diesel £5,000), CX-3 (diesel only with a £3,000 discount). <strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-underline">Mitsubishi - offer expires on 27 March 2018</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The model most buyers will be interested in is the Outlander PHEV - the country's best-selling hybrid car. The Japanese brand is offering a £4,000 scrappage allowance on the vehicle, which you can then combine with a £2,500 saving through the plug-in car grant to pocket £6,500 of the RRP. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there are other savings to be had too: £2,000 off a Mirage supermini, £3,000 off the ASX compact SUV and £5,000 off a diesel-powered Outlander 4x4. </p><img id="i-ee3ee71b9c21a2d7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/03/08/04D68320000003E8-4833864-image-m-3_1514968607627.jpg" height="430" width="634" alt="The Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV is the most popular plug-in hybrid car in the UK in recent years.

Yes, you have to own an older diesel or petrol car for at least 90 days, but when you trade in you could get a discount on, wait for it, another used car. That's only the case for second-hand Nissan LEAFs which are elgible for 'up to' a £2,000 saving.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are deals on new models, too, but only with a maximum £2,000 off the RRP of models including the Micra, Juke, Qashqai and X-Trail. Go for the Acenta trim level on any of these and that discount drops to just £1,000. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-underline">PSA Group - save up to £6,000 on a new Peugeot, Citroen or DS until March</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The French motor group is quick to point out that any discounts available here cannot be used in connection with any other deals and in some cases is knocking more off the price of diesel models than petrols in a bid to offset the decline in sales of oil burning cars.

The restriction to just SUVs will also alienate some buyers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The French carmaker's sister brand, <strong>Dacia</strong>, is also low on our recommended list as it only offers relatively small discounts on two cars in the range - the Sandero and Duster - and you have to have owned the trade-in vehicle for a minimum of 90 days. That said, a £500 off the price of a car that costs just £6,000 new isn't a bad deal at all. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Kia's</strong> deal is similar in that it is limited to just its small cars, though the £2,000 saving on a Picanto or Rio is good value considering their lower list prices. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Toyota's</strong> offer is competitive, though the savings aren't as tempting as some rivals and there is a requirement of a minimum 6 month ownership of the vehicle you trade in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Mazda's</strong> offer  provides substantial savings on some good cars but is cannily providing bigger discounts on diesel examples than petrol to shift vehicles that have fallen out of favour with buyers in recent months.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The <strong>VW Group's</strong> scheme - including Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda cars - hands out some of the biggest discounts at the moment, though it has the restriction of only being available  to those with an old diesel car to trade-in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We highly rate the <strong>Mitsubishi </strong>scrappage scheme - you can trade-in an old petrol or diesel car and pocket big savings on the popular Outlander PHEV. The only reason it misses out on featuring in our 'best offer' group is because the trade-in ownership period is longer than the better schemes - 6 months - and the deal expires marginally earlier (March 27) than most of the others.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The <strong>Hyundai </strong>scrappage and emissions reduction scheme provides some good savings on models across its range, especially the large popular SUVs like the Tucson and Santa Fe, but we're hugely disappointed that they're only offering £2,000 off the price of the Ioniq Hybrid and the plug-in hybrid and full electric models aren't inclusive of a scheme that's meant to encourage drivers to go green. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Nissan</strong> was one of our recommended schemes, but the extension of their offer has seen a reduction in the discounts provided. Now all models are subject to a maximum of £2,000 off, which isn't as good as the best deals. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The better options are from <strong>Ford</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>PSA Group (Peugeot, Citroen and DS)</strong>. Not only will they take an older diesel OR petrol car as part of the scrappage deal, you can get the most substantial discounts on some of their popular cars - like the  Ford Focus, Citroen C4 Picasso and Peugeot 308  - and not be restricted to only being able to buy diesel. All also only require you to have kept the trade-in model for 90 days.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-d8bf2500-f068-11e7-98b0-1f1077456a75">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title"><span class="mol-style-small">How to get a good deal on car scrappage</span></h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">In this excerpt from the weekly This is Money podcast, Simon Lambert, Rob Hull and Georgie Frost take a look at car scrappage schemes and how you  can squeeze the best deal out of them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Press play to listen to the scrappage tips below, or listen (and please subscribe if you like the podcast) at <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/this-is-money-show/id979600898?mt=2">iTunes</a>, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.acast.com/thisismoneyshow">Acast</a> and <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://audioboom.com/channel/thisismoney">Audioboom</a> or visit our <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/podcast/index.html">This is Money Podcast page</a>.   </p><div class="mol-html" id="mol-d8c120d0-f068-11e7-98b0-1f1077456a75">                            <div><iframe width="100%" height="300" style="background-color:transparent;

The will itself outlines the terms of the trust.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Who takes on the role of trustee?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The will should determine who the trustees are, what assets or money the trust contains, who the beneficiaries are and what they are entitled to.</p><img id="i-3f61d2343de7ad95" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/07/17/430D060D00000578-4768524-image-m-11_1502124608418.jpg" height="444" width="306" alt="Ian Dyall: 'It is quite common for wills to create trusts, particularly where money is being left to minor beneficiaries'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It may cover what powers the trustees have. In many cases where a will creates trusts for minor beneficiaries, very little is said in the will about the trustees’ powers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In these cases, the trustees’ powers will be determined by statute - the Trustee Act 1925 and the Trustee Act 2000 - and these are explained below.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is not clear from your question whether you will be a trustee of the trust, so this is something that you should determine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Often the executors of the estate will also be the trustees of any trust created by the will. The trustees are responsible for running the trust.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any assets in the trust should be held in the names of all the trustees on behalf of the beneficiaries.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are obliged to manage the money in line with the terms and conditions of the trust using 'reasonable skill and care' when doing so.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are also responsible for investing the money wisely, reviewing the trust regularly, keeping records of any transactions, completing any tax returns that are required and paying any tax due from the money in the trust.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What tasks must the trustees carry out?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The trustees should start by obtaining a copy of the will to ascertain what powers it provides them with.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although it is unnecessary to see a solicitor to create the trust, it would be worth taking advice from a solicitor on the powers the trustees have, how the trust is taxed, what rights the beneficiaries have to capital and income and what the administrative requirements of the trust are.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are trying to keep costs down, you can ask the solicitor executing the estate to give you some guidance on the trust created by the will. They will be the right type of solicitor and know the case so the advice should be cheaper.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Taking advice at this stage is likely to prevent errors and save costs further down the line.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As part of the administration of the estate, the executors of the estate will provide the trustees with the funds that are to be held in the trust.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Depending on how the will is worded, if there are several sets of parents and children involved as in this case, it might be that it allows for separate trusts to be created for each branch of the family rather than creating one to cover all the children.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In any case, it is worth creating separate pots within a trust for each child. They will have different needs when it comes to issues like university fees, and will reach 21 at different times, so it will make it easier to keep track of their money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The trustees need to consider how to invest those assets wisely. When doing so they have an obligation (under the Trustee Act 2000) to obtain proper advice from somebody qualified unless they conclude that 'it is unnecessary or inappropriate to do so'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, one of the trustees may be a qualified investment adviser, or the sum involved might be too small to make it worth paying fees to an adviser.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">They almost certainly will have the power to invest in almost any type of investment, other than those that can only be held by individuals such as Isas. Any investments should be held in the name of all the trustees.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The choice of investments and how they are held is an important decision as it will determine, amongst other things, the returns made by the investments, the level of tax payable and the amount of administration required.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You do not mention the ages of the beneficiaries, but any funds that are likely to be required within five years are probably best held in cash so that they are not adversely affected by short term market fluctuations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Longer term investments should be invested in assets that have the potential to produce returns in excess of inflation, such as equity based unit trusts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How do you pay out to the beneficiaries?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unless the will stipulates otherwise the beneficiaries are likely to have a statutory right to receive any income produced from the age of 18. The solicitor should be asked to confirm whether this is the case.</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">That would make investments that accumulate income unsuitable at that point. It may be desirable in some cases to invest using a life assurance bond.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These have the advantage of producing no income - all the returns are gains - which means that at 18 the trustees have no obligation to pay anything to the beneficiaries and there is very little tax reporting to do each year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you keep the money in cash accounts, these will provide an income which must be paid out to the beneficiaries after they turn 18.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the trustees wish to provide money to a beneficiary before age of 21, unless the will limits their statutory powers, the Trustee Act 1925 gives them the power to advance money to the beneficiaries for purposes such as paying university fees.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any advancement would need to be properly documented and records kept of what each beneficiary is entitled to from the remaining funds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Appointing benefits to beneficiaries may have income tax, capital gains tax and/or inheritance tax implications, so again it is worth taking advice at that stage as it may be possible to save significantly on these tax liabilities.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When they are 21, or reach whatever other age is specified in a will, the beneficiaries should be paid their share of the money held in the trust at that point.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>My daughter and her cousins are coming into some money from their uncle’s will, but held in trust until they are 21.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">If someone had told you at the end of the 1980s that in less than 30 year's time a Ford Sierra would be worth £115,000, a Vauxhall Lotus Carlton could set you back £72,000 and a Peugeot 205 GTI would ring in at almost £40,000, you'd have probably doubled over in hysterics.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But an almost unfathomable spike in classic car values in recent years - and a rich dose of 1980s and early 1990s nostalgia - has made these sums a reality, with three boy racer poster cars, a Sierra RS500 Cosworth, a Peugeot 205 GTI, and a Lotus Carlton achieving astonishing sale prices at  auction last weekend. So who's laughing now?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here's a closer look at some of the 'classic' cars - including a 2010 Ford Focus - that sold for formidable figures among the £5.5 million worth of motors offered at last weekend's Silverstone Auctions sale.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">The six-figure Ford Sierra</h2><img id="i-faa7d5dff8c26f22" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/01/10/42DE092000000578-4749304-image-a-26_1501579960980.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Six-figure Sierra: Very rare and with incredibly low mileage, this RS500 Cosworth is one of the most desirable late-1980s Fast Fords to come to the market. But at over £100,000, is it a sign that the collectible car market is going bonkers?" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-23e4fe4fbaecb53b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/01/11/42D9FFAC00000578-4749304-The_car_was_sold_at_the_Silverstone_Auctions_sale_at_the_Silvers-a-49_1501583529462.jpg" height="665" width="962" alt="The low-mileage Ford Sierra RS500 Cosworth was sold at the Silverstone Auctions sale at the Silverstone Classic event at - you guessed it - Silverstone over the weekend." class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">That's right, someone genuinely paid £114,750 - a new British record - for a Ford Sierra.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Okay, it's far from any normal Sierra. This one is a rare RS500 Cosworth with a paltry 10,733 miles on the clock. In fact, since it was last MOT'd in September 1991, it has covered just 666 miles - that's around 26 miles a year on average.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As the name suggests, just 500 we made, but few will be in as original and unused condition as this one, which was eventually bought by an Australian bidder who paid £20,000 over the lowest estimate set by the auction house.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Easily recognisable by the passenger jet-sized rear wing, the RS500 was one of the race-car-for-the-road versions of the family hatchback that Ford was struggling to sell in the early 1980s. </p><div>

In return for that loan, they promise to pay you back the sum you invested after a set period and to make an annual interest payment, known as the coupon. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bonds are measured by their yield, which is the coupon they pay out as a percentage of their purchase price. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, for example, a £100 bond with a £5 per year coupon would yield 5 per cent. Bonds can be bought and sold second-hand after issue, and their price in the market will be affected by demand, so if demand rises and that £100 bond trades hands for £110, the yield is now £5 on £110, or 4.54 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bond yields across the developed world are very low, as investors are willing to accept lower payouts, largely thanks to rock bottom interest rates, years of quantitative easing and low or stagnant economic growth. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For a while now, economists have been speculating about when interest rates will start to rise in the UK, with most currently forecasting incremental hikes no earlier than late this year or early next year. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This, along with relatively slow economic growth and low inflation expectations, has helped to keep bond prices up and yields low. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are many reasons for low bond yields - central banks buying up bonds through QE is a huge factor, as well as vast amounts of pension fund money pouring into the asset class and low inflation expectations suggesting that capital will hold its value.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">UK government bond yields fell to record lows at the end of last year and remain below 1 per cent - but this could change if the Bank of England starts to tighten monetary policy by raising rates or shutting down QE. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Short-dated bonds are considered to have the best protection against faster than expected interest rate rises, while longer-dated bonds are at greater risk of things changing unexpectedly through their term.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This extraordinary backdrop means that many consider government bonds to not be the lowest possible risk investment that they once were, however, they top grade government bonds are still considered a key part of investment portfolios - and one that should provide some buffer in times of stock market storms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you decide to buy into government bonds, there are a number of ways to do it including managed funds - but a cost effective way is through an exchange traded fund.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" data-version="2" id="mol-bd6bab40-72d5-11e7-ae56-efc00ee5f64b">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">A bit of background on bonds</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">While few can correctly predict the path of investment values, for nearly all investors, making sure you have a diverse spread of asset classes in your investment portfolio is key to ensuring you don't over-expose yourself to one company, sector or asset type.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For most, bonds form an important component of their portfolio. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bonds - a fixed term security issued by companies or countries to raise debt - are typically seen as lower risk than equities, because should a company or country default on what they owe, bondholders will get their money back before shareholders. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This doesn't make them risk-free, however, as the experience of Greek government bondholders in 2011 and 2012 can attest: they were forced to take a 'haircut' on their assets after Greece admitted it simply couldn't afford its interest payments.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-30a818a0-72d6-11e7-bdd1-d34487160fbb">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> There are a multitude of bonds to choose from and each offers different levels of risk and reward</div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are a multitude of bonds to choose from and each offers different levels of risk and reward: junk bonds are usually cheap and offer high returns on the basis their probability of default is higher than AAA-rated corporate bonds which are often seen as a fairly 'safe' bet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Governments also issue bonds - in the UK they are referred to as gilts and in the US as treasuries.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Where the government bond is issued on behalf of a country with its own currency and central bank and has coupons paid in its own currency, it's less likely that a situation such as that seen in Greece will arise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is because central banks can create its own money to pay the interest it owes to investors on bonds.</p></div>                        </div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Five ETFs for highly-rated bonds</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>We asked Oliver Smith, portfolio manager at IG, for five  ETFs for investing in government bonds.

Therefore long-dated debt is more susceptible to short-term losses when interest rates rise. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Investors in bonds need to take into consideration the shape of the yield curve. The yield curve is currently upward sloping, but from a very low base level.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Short-dated government bonds yield very little (0.1 per cent for a two-year bond), while longer dated maturities have a higher yield, but offer significantly less income than they did in the past.  </p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="http://webfund6.financialexpress.net/clients/dailymail/FundFactsheet.aspx?CitiCode=NIFS&amp;Univ=ETFS" rel="nofollow"><span class="mol-style-large">Lyxor FTSE Actuaries UK Gilts (GILS) </span></a></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For investors wanting exposure to the entire yield curve, GILS has a Total Expense Ratio  of just 0.07 per cent and has physical exposure to the underlying securities in the index.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">First-time buyers still want to get on the ladder as soon as possible. So what is the best course of action if you really want your first home but you want the best possible deal?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We have asked Paula Higgins, chief executive of independent lobbying body The Homeowners Alliance, to answer your questions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">I really want the house but should I offer asking price if house prices generally are falling?</p><img id="i-bcf905401d71ae17" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/28/17/41D7AF1200000578-4617338-Higgins_Sellers_have_a_not_so_secret_weapon_on_their_side_the_wi-a-20_1498666759585.jpg" height="362" width="305" alt="Higgins: 'Sellers have a not-so-secret weapon on their side - the widely-known fact that demand is by far outstripping supply.'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The news that average house prices are falling for the first time in eight years is sure to be music to the ears of millions of would be home buyers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a market where prices are heading downwards it is much easier for a buyer to feel confident enough during the negotiation process to go in with an offer below asking price. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, sellers have a not-so-secret weapon on their side - the widely-known fact that demand is by far outstripping supply. When deciding whether to offer asking price it’s important to look at the norm in the neighbourhood you are considering buying in - not the wider housing market. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While market trends are useful to get an overall picture they don’t always give insight into what’s happening in specific areas of the country or the specific village or road the house is on. Sought after areas of a city will remain sought after regardless of what the general picture is showing so if you’re looking to buy a house in an area where buyers always outstrip available properties it’s important to bear that in mind if you don’t want to keep losing out on houses in your chosen location. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">What information do I need from the estate agent if I want to negotiate?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Check how long the house has been on the market. If it’s been listed for a while this suggests other people think the property is overpriced. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You should also check whether the asking price has dropped at all since it’s been on the market as this is a likely sign the property is struggling to sell.</p><img id="i-80a7c16fee5faf8b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/28/17/0ACEF1DC000005DC-4617338-image-a-21_1498666978491.jpg" height="420" width="634" alt="Find out if the property is being marketed by several agents who can put pressure on the seller" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Have there been offers on the property already? The estate agent cannot by law tell you what these offers have been but they may be able to give an indication of whether they were very close or way off which could help you pitch the price right. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Find out about the seller. Do they want to move quickly? Have they already found their next house? If they are keen to move before a baby arrives or for a job then they are much more likely to be receptive to a lower offer. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Often sellers value the right kind of purchaser even more than price, especially if they’re in a chain. First-time buyers are chain free and if they can show they are ready to move fast with a mortgage in principle in place, they will be a much more attractive proposition than a second stepper in a chain, so use this to your advantage.  </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Find out if the property is being marketed by several agents. If this is the case you can be sure the agent through which you’re making a viewing is much more likely to encourage the seller to accept a lower offer - agents naturally want to ensure they get the commission ahead of their competitors. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">What’s a sensible offer to make? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Do your research. What have recent sold prices of similar houses been in the local area? If it is much lower than asking price but there is little evident difference, pitch that price with your reasoning. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Again it really depends on the local market, competition and how much you want the house but look at offering between 5 and 10 per cent lower than the asking price initially. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Buyers often fall into the trap of thinking they have to throw everything at a property as they only get one chance but this isn’t the case. Agents are obliged to put your offer to the seller and if a higher offer is made by another buyer they will come back to you to tell you and give you a chance to reconsider your offer. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">According to the agent there’s plenty of interest in this property, should I make a high offer to be safe?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Be conscious of estate agent tricks. In a sellers' market where the number of willing buyers outstrips the number of properties on offer you may find the agent is trying to induce a panic among interested parties in order to increase bids. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stay cool and remember regardless of the market or the property, you can only afford what you can afford. Avoid getting yourself into financial difficulty simply because you got caught up in the moment. </p><img id="i-6bcef7a8d9075534" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/28/17/2205952800000578-4617338-image-a-22_1498667114684.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Buyers often fall into the trap of thinking they have to throw everything at a property" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">Can I stop the vendor accepting someone else’s offer if they gazump me? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unfortunately not. While gazumping is an unpleasant practice - and a growing concern according to our latest survey - it is not illegal. Sellers naturally want to get the highest price for their property and, on occasion, that means they’ll accept a higher offer even when they’ve already agreed to yours. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are some steps you can take to avoid being gazumped however. Make clear your offer is subject to the property being taken off the market. This should reduce the chances of being gazumped. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Getting to know the sellers can also help; if you’re in contact with them regularly they will find it harder to accept an offer from a stranger. Showing you’re serious by pressing ahead with your survey is also a good idea.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You should also consider taking out home buyer insurance which will help you to recoup some of the costs if the sale does fall through. </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money floatRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-d8b82ea0-5c14-11e7-823f-7758284c9fbc">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">FIRST-TIME BUYERS ARE RELUCTANT TO HAGGLE ON HOUSING </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Research from Barclays Mortgages has revealed that 51 per cent of those who bought a home for the first time in the past five years regret not negotiating before purchase.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Figures on property purchases made through estate agent Countrywide between April 2016 and April 2017 show that one in five (21 per cent) British first-time buyers paid over the asking price for their property. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In England and Wales, it’s not Londoners but those in Yorkshire and Humber who proved to be the most likely to go over the asking price with almost a third, 29 per cent, paying more than the initial selling price. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Scotland, the figure is even higher at 40 per cent but this reflects the fact that properties are often purchased through the sealed bid system.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Barclays research claimed that a huge 91 per cent of first-time buyers who purchased within the past five years, believe there is not enough negotiating advice available from trusted sources.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold">I want to gazunder my previous offer as prices in the area are coming down – how do I do this without losing the property? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before approaching the homeowner with a lower offer you’ll need to establish why you’re doing so. If a survey has found problems that will be costly to rectify or you’ve uncovered information, perhaps about plans to the surrounding area, which you know will impact on house prices then you have a justifiable reason to go in with a lower offer and the owner may be receptive to this. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If, however, you just want to try your luck because you’ve read house prices are falling you’re playing a dangerous game. House price activity changes regularly; just a few weeks ago most indices reported house price growth. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tread carefully so as not to risk losing the home you’ve spent months trying to buy. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">I can understand negotiating the price down in London, but is it something I could get away with where prices are much lower? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remember, a house is only worth what someone is prepared to pay for it. It’s a cliche but it’s true. Just because a property is priced much lower than its equivalent in the capital would be doesn’t mean it’s priced fairly for its area or, indeed, for current market conditions. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you considered all of the above and compared it with other properties for sale in the area and you think you could get it for less then offer less. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">Is price the only thing I should be negotiating? What about the condition of the property and white goods? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many sellers will try to get you to up your offer by throwing in things to the deal such as white goods. Try not to be overly influenced by this. It’s worth remembering that unless they are almost brand new, within warranty and have guarantees that are transferrable, white goods tend to be worth very little. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">Should I do this myself or should my solicitor look after this? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Usually your solicitor will conduct any further negotiations relating to the deal however, whether you’re negotiating on a price for the property or for additional extras sometimes it can be helpful to speak directly with the sellers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Be warned, agents and solicitors are usually against this but negotiating in person can be a more straightforward approach. And if you click with the owner it could work out even better. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">What about legal fees – can I negotiate on those too? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can’t usually negotiate but you can shop around and it’s essential that you do so. Choosing the wrong solicitor can cost you hundreds of pounds.

This is the easiest way to make sure your family isn’t left with a financial headache after your death.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We've put together a Q&amp;A to help you get started, with help from Jeannie Boyle, a chartered financial planner. </p><img id="i-468953482e8109c9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/13/09/416203AA00000578-4541182-Jeannie_Boyle_is_a_chartered_financial_planner-a-3_1497342125185.jpg" height="382" width="306" alt="Jeannie Boyle is a chartered financial planner " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How much IHT will I have to pay?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is quite easy. Write down how much everything you own is worth (don’t include pensions in this) and take away how much money you owe. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is called your estate and it is the amount that your IHT bill is based on. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You do get tax free allowances, but anything you leave over these thresholds will be taxed at 40 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My biggest asset is my home. Can I just give it to the kids and live there?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most of the time this won’t work. If you give something away, but can still ‘enjoy’ it then it isn’t really a gift. So, living rent free would cause problems.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, if you paid rent at a commercial rate this could be a solution. You would need to get a solicitor involved to ensure that there was a clear written agreement. As well as reducing the potential for family conflict, it prevents HMRC taking issue with your arrangements – they aren’t keen on arrangements involving the family home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you ran out of money to pay rent you could be evicted and may find claiming state benefits difficult if you are deemed to have ‘deliberately deprived’ yourself of money. If you died within seven years there may be IHT to pay on the gift and the residence nil rate band (RNRB) cannot be used against this. (More on this later).</p><img id="i-c6312cd122fa37c9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/13/10/416274A700000578-4541182-image-a-5_1497344959045.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="The new residence nil rate band came in this April, and will increase over the next four years" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-large">Will my partner get everything?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you haven’t made a will your partner won’t inherit any of your assets unless you are married or in a civil partnership. This is true regardless of how long you have been living together or whether you have children together. There is no such thing as a common law spouse.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The laws of intestacy (when you die without a will) determine what happens to your wealth. </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are unmarried your assets will go to your children, grandchildren, parents, siblings, nieces and nephews. If you have no living family your estate passes to the Crown.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If your partner was financially dependent on you they would have to make a claim for financial hardship under the Inheritance Act, but this make take some time to process and they still may not receive all your assets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even if you make a will leaving everything to your partner, they will still have to pay IHT on anything over the value of £325,000. Only assets left to spouses or civil partners are exempt from inheritance tax. Getting married for tax purposes might not be romantic, but it can make financial sense.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>I’m married, so my spouse will inherit everything – do I still need a will?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many people assume everything they own will pass to their spouse, but if your personal assets are worth more than £250,000 this isn’t the case. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any assets you own jointly will automatically go to your spouse (most couples own their home as joint tenants). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your spouse also keeps all the assets and personal possessions up to a value of £250,000. If you don’t have any children, your spouse also keeps everything else. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have children, your spouse and the children get half each of everything over £250,000 – your spouse gets 50 per cent and the kids share the other 50 per cent. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remember that only your spouse can inherit free of inheritance tax – if the children receive more than £325,000, then someone will have to pay some inheritance tax.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you make a will you can make sure your wishes are carried out – it can also help avoid any family squabbling about who gets what.</p><img id="i-7b2935422a1dbb0a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/13/10/41629F1300000578-4541182-Only_your_spouse_can_inherit_free_of_inheritance_tax_so_it_can_m-a-9_1497346243129.jpg" height="422" width="633" alt="Only your spouse can inherit free of inheritance tax so it can make financial sense to wed" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-large">How much can I leave free of tax?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The nil rate band is the amount everyone can leave without any inheritance tax. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Currently it’s £325,000 but married couples can double their allowances up to leave up to £650,000 free of IHT. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The nil rate band has been frozen since 2009/10 – one of the reasons so many more people are paying IHT. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is due to start increasing with inflation from 2020/21.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But thanks to an new - and slightly complicated - releif for your home if you own it, you can now leave more.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-large">I thought I could leave £1million?</p><img id="i-495d24440e0e0dc1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/13/10/26C4BFC100000578-4541182-image-m-22_1497346463661.jpg" height="400" width="306" alt="George Osborne introduced the RNRB" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was the Conservative Government’s manifesto promise, but what the former Chancellor George Osborne actually delivered was quite different. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new residential nil rate band (RNRB) came into effect in April this year. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It applies to a residential property that you have lived in at some point in your life and own when you die and leave to your child or grandchild. Adopted and step children can also benefit from this allowance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The RNRB is being phased in starting at £100,000 this year, then increasing every tax year until it reaches £175,000 in 2020/21. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like the standard nil rate band, it can be passed to a surviving spouse. This applies even if your spouse died before the new allowance was introduced.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For a detailed look at these changes, <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="" href="/money/mortgageshome/article-3720130/What-know-inheritance-tax-family-home-allowance.html">read more here</a>. </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS money" data-version="2" id="mol-e9437970-50dc-11e7-83b3-c5f1b6457b75">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">IHT above £2m </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Once the full main home extra allowance is in place, the taper means that it will be lost altogether for estates worth above £2.7million.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Government didn’t want to be seen introducing a benefit for the very wealthy so there is taper in place.

If you die before age 75 your loved ones will not pay any tax on the fund. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are over 75 when you pass away, your beneficiaries will pay income tax (at 0 per cent, 20 per cent, 40 per cent or 45 per cent, depending on their own income tax rate).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have other savings and investments it makes sense to use these to provide your income in retirement instead of your pension. This means the taxable assets are reduced but the non-taxable asset – the pension – retains its value and can be passed on free of IHT.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is an exception to this rule. If you move your pension from one provider to another whilst you are in poor health and then die within two years HMRC can include the value of the pension is your taxable estate. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s best to speak to a financial adviser about these issues.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-large">Is there anything else that is exempt from inheritance tax?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you run your own business or own shares in a business these could be exempt from inheritance tax. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shares in qualifying unlisted businesses qualify for 100 per cent business property relief (BPR) provided they are held at death and for two of the preceding five years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some types of business don’t qualify, even if they are unlisted.

In some cases the premiums can increase dramatically after five or ten years. If you cancel the policy before you die you will not benefit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The premiums themselves can be paid as gifts out of regular income. If you have other life assurance policies it’s a good idea to have their proceeds paid into a trust as well, to ensure there is no IHT on the value.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You should only do this if you’re in good health, otherwise there could be a transfer of value for IHT purposes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-large">Can I give away my money?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes you can – but the type of gift you are making will determine how it is treated for IHT. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Government doesn’t allow you to simply give everything away at the last moment to avoid tax. In most instances you need to live for seven years after making a gift to ensure it is free of IHT. It will really help your executors if you keep clear records of the gifts you have made.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gifting early means there is more chance you will survive seven years and get the benefit of seeing your loved ones enjoy the wealth you have created.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have assets that you think might grow in value, it can make sense to give these away instead of cash as all the growth will be outside of your estate immediately. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remember that you may have to pay capital gains tax if you give away an asset which has grown in value since you purchased it. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Capital gains tax at 10 per cent or 20 per cent on the profit might be better value than 40 per cent IHT on the whole gift.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For a gift to be effective for IHT purposes it must be made without any strings attached.

The gift is potentially exempt because, providing you live seven years after making the gift, then there is no IHT to pay. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, if you die within seven years the recipient may have to pay IHT and the gift will use up part or all of your nil rate band.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The amount of tax charged is tapered over seven years. Lots of people think it’s the value of the gift that reduces, which is incorrect. This is important because a large gift – over £325,000 – will mean you have no nil rate band available until the seven year period ends so all your other assets could be subject to IHT.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s also important to remember the person who received the gift will have to pay the tax. You can take out an insurance policy to provide the recipient with the money to pay the tax, but this can be expensive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-large">Can I ensure grandchildren don't get access to the money too early?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s not always appropriate to make an outright gift to an individual, especially if they are under 18. Setting up a trust allows you to start the seven year clock ticking without giving immediate access to large sums of money.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-76967e10-501c-11e7-b4fa-2d379fe26934">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> Setting up a discretionary trust gives the trustees (which can include you) flexibility over who should benefit and when they can access the money</div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The simplest form of trust is a bare trust or absolute trust. Setting up a bare trust for a minor gives them the assets for tax purposes, but the trustees retain control until the child reaches 18. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One potential drawback is that the child can demand full access once they turn 18 - quite an alarming prospect.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Setting up a discretionary trust gives the trustees (which can include you) flexibility over who should benefit and when they can access the money. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This allows you to provide for family members – including those not yet born – in line with your wishes, and to protect family wealth being spent irresponsibly or becoming subject to divorce proceedings. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As the name suggests the trustees have discretion over who among the range of possible beneficiaries receives a benefit and when they receive it. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As there is no immediately identifiable taxable beneficiary, HMRC requires such trusts to be assessed for IHT every 10 years to avoid families holding wealth outside of the IHT net. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Currently the maximum rate of IHT such trusts need to pay every 10 years is 6 per cent. You should never set up such a trust without first seeking professional guidance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If your gift to a discretionary trust is more than £325,000 there can be an immediate tax charge. There can also be tax charges every 10 years. It’s best to speak to a financial planner or legal adviser before setting up this type of trust to ensure it meets your needs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-large">What if I think I might need the money back?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Giving money to a trust is the same as giving money to an individual – you have no right to ask for it back. You need to be sure you won’t need the capital in the future. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An alternative solution is a gift and loan trust. You set up a trust by making a small gift – usually £10 – then loan the trustees some money to invest. The trustees then invest the money – the growth on the investment is outside your estate, but you can ask for your loan to be repaid at any time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This doesn’t achieve a huge saving in inheritance tax on day one, but you have the security of knowing you can get your money back. It also means you still have your nil rate band available for other gifts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-large">What investments are free of IHT?</p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shares in qualifying, unlisted business qualify for 100 per cent business property relief provided they are held at the date of death and for two of the preceding five years. This means there is no IHT to pay on their value.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Qualifying investments quoted on the Alternative Investment Market qualify for BPR and can also be held within a tax-free Isa.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Investing in AIM companies carries a higher level of risk than larger companies listed on the main stock exchange: your investment could fail entirely, resulting in a far greater loss than any potential IHT liability. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In addition, not all AIM companies qualify for BPR. It can be helpful to use an AIM portfolio management service to ensure the right stocks are purchased and the risk is spread across a number of holdings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Enterprise Investment Scheme  was set up to encourage investment in small private companies that might otherwise struggle to raise capital. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Investors benefit from a range of tax reliefs including up to 30 per cent upfront income tax relief, and full IHT relief after a two year holding period.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-large">Where do I go to get help?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are unsure what the best course of action for your circumstances is, speak to a financial adviser. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chartered financial planners have a high level of qualification so should be equipped to deal with most estate planning needs.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">You are now worried that as the previous tenant is being chased by debt collectors, your own credit score could be affected or you may even get a visit from a bailiff at the door.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We approached an expert to see where you stand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>James Jones, head of consumer affairs at Experian, replies: </strong>'As far as your credit rating is concerned, unless the previous tenant is using your name then your rating should be totally safe. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This is because credit checks these days take place on people and not on addresses. People can only be linked on credit checks by joint financial activity, such as if two people take out a joint loan or joint bank account. That's unlikely to have happened here.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Most people who are linked in this way will be current or ex-partners. If you want to double check this, simply order a copy of your credit report from any of the three credit reference agencies (Experian, Equifax and Callcredit) and check the section called 'financial associations'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If the previous tenant's name is not there then you have absolutely nothing to worry about.</p><img id="i-9f49aa639c6218" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/23/10/40B1A50D00000578-4533338-image-a-2_1495531484095.jpg" height="424" width="634" alt="It is always worth checking your credit score to make sure there are no fraudulent transactions" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'On to those debt demands. I suggest you return any post sent to the previous tenant straight back to the senders, making it very clear they no longer live at the address. They should eventually get the message. If they persist, get the head office address of the firm or firms in question and send a formal, written complaint.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Your own credit report should include details of any credit accounts (such as cards, bank accounts, loans, mail order accounts, car finance, and mobile phone contracts) that you've used in the last six years. </p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'These records will show whether you made the monthly payments on time and, for open accounts, how much you currently owe. Other records added to credit reports include court judgments and insolvencies, the electoral roll, and a record of any recent credit applications.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's sensible to review your credit report with all three credit reference agencies at least once a year and, additionally, before making any important credit application. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'That way, if you spot a discrepancy you can ask the agency to correct it before it affects you. A one-off 'statutory' report costs just £2 and you can sometimes get this for free.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Rebecca Rutt adds:</strong> 'Even if you don't have a forwarding address for the tenant, you can send back these letters to the companies in question.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As the debt isn't in your name, the firms involved should stop sending these letters but  if you're concerned about a bailiff turning up at your door you can always seek advice from a <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/action-your-creditor-can-take/bailiffs/">charity such as Citizens Advice</a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has conducted a lot of work around debt collection agency practices during the past year.

The app also charges a platform fee of 0.45 per cent, and users must pay for the underlying tracker funds, which cost around 0.2 per cent. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Is my money protected?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The company is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority so if it was to go bust, your investments would be protected up to the value of £50,000.  This only applies if the company fails, not if your investments lose money - which could happen, as with any form of playing the stock market. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://track.adform.net/C/?bn=14307523">Moneyfarm</a> - An affordable wealth management service</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong> What does it do?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The app for wealth manager <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://track.adform.net/C/?bn=14307523">Moneyfarm</a> is a quick and convenient way to create and keep track of an investment portfolio on the go. The idea is that you can open an account and start investing within 10 minutes, in a way that is cheaper than using a traditional financial adviser or investing platform. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How does it work? </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When you sign up you'll be given a questionnaire to assess your appetite for risk, which will help place you in to one of six investment portfolios. These portfolios are monitored by Moneyfarm's investment committee who rebalance them as the market moves so that they stay within your risk tolerance level while (hopefully) increasing in value. </p><img id="i-5b3a25b8790bfa0b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/16/15/21684E4400000578-4116506-image-a-2_1484581023927.jpg" height="458" width="306" alt="Moneyfarm helps you grow your investments" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no minimum investment amount - customers can open an account with just £1. However, the wealth manager recommends that customers put in at least £1,500 so that their investments can be sufficiently diversified across different parts of the market to meet the level of risk they want to take. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Using Moneyfarm in app form means you can review your portfolio, track the performance and withdraw money whenever you want, using your phone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are no management fees on the first £10,000, but you will pay a 0.6 per cent charge on anything between £10,001 to £100,000. For investments of between £100,000 and £1million this charge falls to 0.4 per cent, and there is nothing to pay on investments of more than £1million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This means that if you invested £20,000, for example, the management fee would be £60. That's because there is no charge on the first £10,000, and a 0.6 per cent charge on the remaining £10,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On top of this, Moneyfarm users must pay the underlying cost of the ETFs used to build their portfolio, typically 0.25 per cent, which is taken from the value of their investments. There are no other fees to pay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Is my money protected?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your personal account details are encrypted to help keep them safe, while MoneyFarm is authorised and regulated by the FCA. As with Moneybox, if the company collapsed, your investments would be protected up to the value of £50,000 under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. However, as with any investment, the value of your assets can go down as well as up and you may come out with less money than you started with. </p><img id="i-ed95553c2946eb8b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/30/16/3C6B16C700000578-4116506-image-a-2_1485794065287.jpg" height="394" width="634" alt="Better budgeting: Money Dashboard categories your spending automatically " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.moneydashboard.com/">Money Dashboard </a>– keeps track of all your accounts in one place and breaks down your spending</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What does it do? </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Money Dashboard is a clever tool which lets you view all of your incomings and out-goings including credit cards, current accounts and savings all in one place, using just one log in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For those with accounts with several different providers this can be a real time saver particularly if you struggle to remember all of your online banking passwords.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong> How does it work?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The app is available for both Android and iOS users for free.

The Squirrel app segments your money into three groups – commitments (your bills, rent or mortgage payments), savings and spending money. The app then releases funds back to your current account bit by bit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When bills are due the Squirrel account will pay the needed balance back into your bank account just in time to make sure you always have enough cash to cover them plus it will allocate funds for any savings goals you are working towards into a separate savings pot.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any money left over is classed as spending money which the app then divides into weekly instalments which are then transferred into your current account at the start of each week to help stretch your cash out between pay days.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you need more cash for unexpected expenses you can ask for more of your pay cheque to be transferred to your account early, but it will take a day to hit.

It will help you locate all of your different pots and manage them for you. Technically it's not an 'app' but it is optimised to be used on a mobile phone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-small">How does it work?</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first step is tracking down where all your pensions savings are. If you can't find them or don't have the time, give the app the names of your past and current employers and its 'beekeepers' will track them down for you. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The app then consolidates all of these savings plans in one place. You can see your current pot size, your projected retirement income, and set up regular or one-off contributions with a few clicks. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If there is an exit fee of more than £10, the app will let you know. Equally, if your old pension has guarantees, such as guaranteed annuity rates or a final salary promise, it promises to send you the all the relevant paperwork to consider before you transfer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have a pension with guaranteed benefits over £30,000, you are required to take financial advice from a transfer specialist before you transfer it. PensionBee does not provide financial advice and you will need to find an adviser.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-small">How much does it cost?</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The app itself is free and it doesn't charge anything to consolidate your pensions. But PensionBee does charge an annual fee of between 0.5 and 0.7 per cent of your total pension depending on how tailored a service you opt for. This  includes underlying fees paid to the managers who invest your money. It claims the average cost of a managing a pension is 0.8 per cent, making this service quite competitive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong><span class="mol-style-small">Is it safe?</span></strong> </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In terms of data protection, pretty safe as the app uses high level encryption to protect your personal details. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, as with all pensions, your money is being invested - so there is a risk you could lose some or all of your money if those investments performed poorly. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If PensionBee were to go bust then your capital would be protected under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, with no upper limit.<strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/savings-goals/id507466769?mt=8">Savings goals</a> - helps you build up cash for major life milestones</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-small">What does it do? </span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whether it's a wedding, university fees or a new home, we all have long-term goals that require some serious dosh.

They then use real-time mortgage rates to calculate an indicative monthly payment, based on your circumstances and preferences. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once you've been through the process with the chat bot, Habito recommends a specific lender and mortgage product based on the ‘true cost’ of the mortgage, meaning  all fees, rates and additional costs are factored in. This recommendation also factors in how likely lenders are to accept your application based on whether you can afford the repayments.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is also done online or on your mobile. You are then put in touch with a mortgage adviser over the phone, who checks the recommendation before sending you the details by email. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's free to use and Habito won't charge you for the advice they give you.

Therefore before you switch it’s worth calling up the new provider to check what the situation is.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We asked Ovo what might happen and a spokesperson said: ‘There are several different smart meter manufacturers that energy suppliers use, so your new supplier may not use the same smart technology or networks as Ovo.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘That means there is a chance that your smart meter, and other devices connected to it, may lose some or all of their functionality when you switch.

We were told that if an energy customer wants to switch supplier they should usually be able to do this seamlessly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, with the first generation of smart meters, of which nearly five million have already been installed across the UK, some meters won’t work if you’re switching suppliers.</p><img id="i-a33eb17ee0b269ff" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/24/09/3D9ADFE200000578-4223724-image-a-2_1487928355321.jpg" height="424" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">We were told this should only happen in a small number of cases but if it does  you may need to temporarily send in manual readings during the switch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The problem is being fixed as a national communications network for smart meters was launched last year and when all first generation meters are connected to this, we are told the problem will be eradicated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you already have a smart meter installed, chances are it's a first generation meter so therefore you could encounter this problem.

For those years you would only have been building up rights to a basic state pension, but not to SERPS.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the pension you have built up by 2016 also reflects the work you have done since 1990. If you were working for another employer you could have done another 25 years when you were not ‘contracted out’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In each of those years you would have built up rights under SERPS and then the State Second Pension. These rights would be added to the basic state pension that you were building up.</p><img id="i-284db5ff8cac0b5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/11/24/15/3AA65E4A00000578-0-Steve_Webb_Find_out_how_to_ask_the_former_Pensions_Minister_a_qu-m-3_1480000398257.jpg" height="424" width="306" alt="Steve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Depending on exactly how much you were earning, these two elements together might have made £155 (or more) by 2016.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The way that the new state pension is worked out is that everyone is given a ‘starting amount’ in April 2016, and this is the higher of two numbers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first is the amount of pension you have already built up under the old rules (a full basic pension of £119.30 per week for 30 years in the system plus any SERPS pension).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The second is the amount you would get under the new rules (a full flat rate pension of £155.65 for 35 years less a big deduction for past contracting out).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In your case, the second calculation would clearly leave you short of the full flat rate and so it is very likely that your pension is based on the first amount.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This means your amount to date will be £119.30 if you have contributed for at least 30 years, plus the SERPS pension you have earned in the 26 years since 1990.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This could easily be another £36 per week which would get you to the £155 figure.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">How rich are you? The highly subjective answer to that will be influenced by your attitude to wealth, income vs spending habits, and where in the country you live. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The debate on what being wealthy actually means came to the fore last week, with a story about households who were <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="" href="/money/cardsloans/article-4090894/Half-families-earning-70k-say-just-managing.html">earning £70,000 but said they were just about managing</a>. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Predictably, many readers were dismissive of those claiming their family was struggling on such a relatively high income. ‘They’re rich’, they cried. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Others, however, said that those claiming to be just about getting by had a point. ‘Oh no they aren't,’ came their reply. </font></p><img id="i-a9d5b655d4ce6ac3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/11/17/3C0E09AF00000578-0-image-a-1_1484156713373.jpg" height="355" width="634" alt="The ONS  figures reveal how the UK's household disposable income is divided" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Really, both sides of this argument are right. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">With £70,000 of household income split equally, a two working parent family, with two children under 13, would have after tax income of about £53,900 - higher  than 76 per cent of the population. They are comparatively rich.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Yet, while £70,000 coming in each year would probably make you feel fairly flush in the North East of England, it is unlikely to pull off the same trick in North East London – which, it should be noted, is not a traditionally wealthy area.  </font></p><div>

The Government has more information on this <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gov.uk/additional-state-pension/further-information">here.</a></font></p><div class="money" id="mol-fdef20f0-b333-11e6-9bf4-5109ea8ec2f5"> <table class="mol-table" data-swipe-article="false" width="100%"> <caption class="wocc">WHAT SERPS YOU INHERIT BASED ON A HUSBAND OR WIFE'S AGE</caption> <tbody>  <tr>   <th>Man’s date of birth</th>    <th>Woman’s date of birth </th><th>Maximum % of their SERPS you can inherit </th>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>5 October 1937 or before</td>    <td>5 October 1942 or before</td><td class="mol-style-align-center">100%</td>   </tr><tr><td>6 October 1937 to 5 October 1939</td><td>6 October 1942 to 5 October 1944 </td><td class="mol-style-align-center">90% </td></tr><tr><td>6 October 1939 to 5 October 1941 </td><td>6 October 1944 to 5 October 1946 </td><td class="mol-style-align-center">80% </td></tr><tr><td>6 October 1941 to 5 October 1943</td><td>6 October 1946 to 5 October 1948</td><td class="mol-style-align-center">70% </td></tr><tr><td>6 October 1943 to 5 October 1945 </td><td>6 October 1948 to 6 July 1950 </td><td class="mol-style-align-center">60% </td></tr><tr><td>6 October 1945 and after </td><td>6 July 1950 and after </td><td class="mol-style-align-center">50% </td></tr> </tbody> </table></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As you have said you are 77, I am assuming you were born in 1939. From the table this means that your wife can inherit either 80 per cent or 90 per cent of your SERPS pension, depending on your exact birth date.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Unfortunately, it is not quite as simple as taking (say) 90 per cent of your SERPS pension.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This is because your SERPS pension is actually the difference between two numbers – the gross SERPS pension you would have got if you had never been contracted out, and something called a ‘contracted out deduction’ (or COD for short) to reflect the fact that some of your NI contributions went to provide your own pension rather than building up a state pension.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The way it works is that your wife would inherit 90 per cent of your gross SERPS pension but only 50 per cent of your COD. Without knowing the fine detail of your pension calculation it is hard to estimate the exact figure, but the good news is that your wife is likely to end up with more than 90 per cent of your current SERPS figure. In other words, she should get more than 90 per cent of your £25.57, or £23.01.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Adding this to the full basic state pension of £119.30, would give her a total pension of at least £142.31, an increase of around 91 per cent on her current rate.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">On the other hand, you should be aware that if a small part of the £25.57 is not in fact a SERPS pension but comes from the old Graduated Retirement Benefit scheme or the new ‘State Second Pension’ which was introduced in 2002, only 50 per cent of these parts of your pension can be inherited. </font></p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS money" id="mol-3c1577d0-b334-11e6-9bf4-5109ea8ec2f5">                            <h3 class="wocc">                                <span style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>WHAT ARE THE NEW STATE PENSION RULES FOR MARRIED WOMEN?</strong></span></h3>                            <div class="ins cleared xolcc bdrcc">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Steve Webb explains the previous NI payments system for married women and how it's changed<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.ukhttp:"> </a><a style="font-weight: bold;" class="" href="/money/pensions/article-3577195/My-state-pension-just-80-42-right-Retirement-Agony-Uncle-Steve-Webb-answers.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here.</a></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">There's more about the new state pension system for women <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="" href="/money/pensions/article-3432217/Don-t-bank-benefiting-partner-s-state-pension-April-warns-Age-UK.html" target="_blank">here.</a></span></p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Given the complexity around these transitional arrangements you may wish to contact the Pension Service in writing to ask exactly where your wife would stand.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For those who are receiving the new state pension, the rules are much less generous. With the exception of the special rules for widows who had paid the ‘married woman’s stamp’ for an extended period, there is no inheritance of state pension rights where the person who died was receiving £155.65 or less.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">However, where the person who has died was receiving more than this, the excess amount is known as a ‘protected payment’ and half of this ‘protected payment’ can be inherited.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">To give an example, if a man comes under the new state pension and is receiving £165.65 per week, the first £155.65 is ignored, but the extra £10 is his ‘protected payment’. Half of this amount, or five pounds per week, can be inherited.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The thinking behind this is that under the new system the goal is for far more individuals, and for more women in particular, to build up a full flat rate pension in their own right, rather than needing to depend on claiming a pension based on someone else’s contribution record.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox money" id="1e37a8a0-589e-11e6-87b6-2b033ebc741b"><h3 class="wocc">                                <span style="font-weight: bold;">ASK STEVE WEBB A PENSION QUESTION </span>                            </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared xolcc bdrcc">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Former Pensions Minister Steve Webb is This Is Money's Agony Uncle.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He is ready to answer your questions, whether you are still saving, in the process of stopping work, or juggling your finances in retirement.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Since leaving the Department of Work and Pensions after the May 2015 election, Steve has joined pension firm Royal London as director of policy.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">If you would like to ask Steve a question about pensions, please email him at <strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="http://pensionquestions@thisismoney.co.uk/">pensionquestions@thisismoney.co.uk</a></strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Steve will do his best to reply to your message in a forthcoming column, but he won't be able to answer everyone or correspond privately with readers. Nothing in his replies constitutes regulated financial advice.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Let us start by thinking about the start of your maternity leave, and work on the assumption that you are entitled to statutory maternity pay (SMP).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You can get up to 39 weeks of SMP but the rate changes after six weeks. For the first six weeks you are entitled to 90 per cent of your average weekly earnings (before tax). For the rest of the period (up to 39 weeks) you get the lower of £139.58 or 90 per cent of your average weekly earnings.</font></p><img id="i-531a4a5e3091658e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/06/06/14/34F8B9BC00000578-0-image-m-9_1465218007838.jpg" height="398" width="306" alt="Steve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This means that higher earners may see a significant drop in their rate of SMP after the initial period. You can read more about the rules <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave/overview">here.</a></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For pension purposes, receiving SMP is the same as being paid a regular wage by your employer. If you normally pay a percentage of your wage into a pension scheme, you would continue to pay that percentage out of your SMP.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And if your employer normally pays a percentage of your wage into a pension, that percentage would continue but based on the amount you were earning before you started your maternity leave (which will usually be higher).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Therefore, your personal contributions will usually fall, unless you actively choose to boost them yourself, but your employer's contributions will not.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It is worth bearing in mind that SMP is a legal minimum. Some firms will pay you at a higher rate – for example, full pay for three months or six months – and some firms will pay for a longer period.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But the basic principle is the same – for pension purposes, pay is pay, whether it is from SMP, SMP topped up by additional pay from your employer, or regular pay.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Of course, some mothers will continue to stay on maternity leave for more than 39 weeks. In general, you have a legal right to 52 weeks of maternity leave, which means that the final 13 weeks may be unpaid, so you will be making no personal contributions during that period unless you actively choose to do so.</font></p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS money" id="9e904af0-a5bc-11e6-97a0-f16e40faebf2">                            <h3 class="wocc"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHO QUALIFIES FOR STATUTORY MATERNITY PAY? </span>                            </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared xolcc bdrcc">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Not all pregnant women qualify.

You will need to appoint two trusted executors to administer your affairs. </span>Many people choose a spouse or one of their adult children (an executor must be over 18) – it might be obvious but make sure you appoint people who are younger than you and are happy to do it.  Ask them before you put them down in your will. Professional executors are likely to charge a fee. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. How do I know if I have to pay inheritance tax? </span>A certain amount of a person’s estate escapes IHT.  This amount is set by the government and is known as either the 'tax-free allowance' or the ‘nil rate band’.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">At the moment the nil rate band is set at £325,000 (this is after </font><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">all debts, such as a mortgage, and expenses such as funeral costs) and this rate is expected to stay the same until 5 April 2017. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">Spouses and civil partners can pass assets between themselves free of inheritance tax and their allowances can effectively be transferred to double the surviving partners allowance to £650,000.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">What this means is that an estate worth more than £325,000 (or £650,000 for married couples) will be charged IHT at a rate of 40 per cent* on anything above that level.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>New £100,000 tax-free allowance from April 2017  </strong>From 6 April 2017, each person will get an additional £100,000 (rising to £175,000 by 2020-21) tax-free allowance to use against the value of their home.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">They can only get this additional allowance if they leave their home to their children or grandchildren.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This allowance can also transfer to the surviving spouse if it isn’t used up already. This means by 2020-21, a married couple could leave their heirs a combined estate of up to £1million without incurring Inheritance Tax.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><a style="font-weight: bold;" class="" href="/money/mortgageshome/article-3720130/What-know-inheritance-tax-family-home-allowance.html">&gt; Read our full guide to IHT and the new family home allowance </a></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. What if my estate exceeds the threshold for inheritance tax? </span>Every year more people are finding that their personal estate is valued in excess of the current inheritance tax nil rate band of £325,000. When an individual dies, anything valued over and above this amount will be taxed at a rate of 40 per cent. The number of people with estates valued above the nil rate band has increased in recent years. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">People may think that paying IHT is ‘only for rich people’, not realising that the value of their property could push them over the threshold. They may also wrongly assume that they can avoid tax by simply giving away their assets. In fact, barring an annual £3,000 gift allowance, and certain other special allowances, almost everything a person gives away in the seven years before their death will be liable to IHT.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">5.What can I do to minimise this? </span>The good news for married couples and civil partners is that they are able to pass their assets and possessions to each other tax-free. Also, if the tax-free allowance is not used, the surviving partner is then able to double the nil rate band to £650,000 upon their death.  </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">With the right financial planning, practically everyone with an IHT liability should be able to reduce or even eliminate it, and pass on as much of their estate to their loved ones as possible. There are a number of different IHT planning solutions available. Speak to a qualified investment adviser or IFA who will advise you on the right approach.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">6. Appoint a guardian for children under the age of 18.</span> And don’t forget any newcomers – always remember to update your will if your personal or financial circumstances change. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">7. Do you wish to be buried or cremated?</span> It’s a difficult thought to entertain but if you do have preferences then it’s important to state this in your will. </font></p></div></div><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Nearly 60 per cent of adults across the UK have not written a will, leaving their final wishes in the hands of Government intestacy rules.

If you accept that you owe the money, you should pay the bill as soon as possible and certainly by any deadline set by the court.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">To get an order set aside, you must have a good reason, such as the demand was sent to the wrong address even though you gave the company the correct one, denying you a chance to defend yourself.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Alternatively, you must be able to prove you have a good defence to the claim.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For instance, perhaps you don't owe the money at all because you have been the victim of identity fraud.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The process can take up to a year and will cost at least £255 — potentially thousands of pounds if you use a solicitor.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">To challenge a CCJ, you need an N244 form. You can get this from hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk or call your local county court.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Tick the box that asks if you want your application heard in court.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This allows you to make your argument in person, normally in the county court closest to you.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The form will also ask you why you think the CCJ should be set aside. Outline the facts succinctly and clearly.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you have witnesses — perhaps someone who can prove you never lived at a certain address — mention that you can provide statements from them as well.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Send the form to the county court that issued the CCJ.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>ARGUE YOUR CASE</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Try negotiating with the company chasing you for money, as Sandra Laine did successfully (see box above).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Contact whoever deals with debt collection at the firm. This should be listed in the judgment. If you are unsure, call customer services and ask for an address.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you don't have a copy of the CCJ, ask the court that issued it.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Tell the firm in writing that you are applying to have the CCJ set aside. Explain why. The company may decide it's not worth its while going to court and agree to the order being thrown out as long as you pay what you owe quickly.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">However, even if you reach an agreement with the firm, a judge will still have to give permission.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Send the court a letter stating that the debt has been paid and that both parties consent to the judgment being set aside. This must be signed both by you and your creditor.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The judge may still ask you to attend a hearing.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If the company doesn't consent to setting aside the CCJ, the next step is a court hearing. It normally takes three to four months for one to be arranged.</font></p><img id="i-6890bcf3c3f2d061" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/09/20/21/063E1CA30000044D-3798933-image-a-5_1474402983903.jpg" height="438" width="634" alt="Shock: If you've moved home, you may only learn about the CCJ when you apply for credit, often years later" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>YOUR DAY IN COURT</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you do not have a solicitor, court can seem scary.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">However, your case will not be heard in a court room with lawyers in wigs and gowns, but in a meeting room, where you can sit down.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It should feel like a conversation rather than a formal court case.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Speak only when you are invited to do so and remain polite at all times. Always refer to the judge as 'Sir' or 'Madam'.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Get to the point quickly and clearly. Never rant and rave — even if you are convinced you have been treated unfairly.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Don't behave like a lawyer in a courtroom drama either, as this will annoy the judge.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you don't feel confident about speaking in court or your case is complicated, it may be worth asking a solicitor to help.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The hearing lasts between 15 minutes and one hour.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The judge will normally decide straight away whether or not to set aside the order — though they may ask you questions about your statement. If they agree to do so, you will receive a letter. They will also notify the Registry Trust, which holds a record of CCJs.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you pay what you owe within the timeframe set by the judge, every trace of the CCJ will be removed from your record — but check your credit file to be sure.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You should also ask your creditor for a receipt and confirmation that the debt was settled on time.</font></p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>IF THE CCJ IS WRONG</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A set aside order doesn't mean the CCJ has gone forever.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you fail to pay your debts, it can be put back on your file.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But in some cases you may feel that you owe nothing at all.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For instance, someone might have stolen your identity or the car that incurred a parking fine did not belong to you at the time.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Farmer Libby Portch, from Dunster, Somerset, was left with a £1,000 legal bill after fighting for a year to have a CCJ removed.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Someone had been using her name for two years for their utilities and £200 of unpaid bills were sent to a house where she had never lived. She only discovered the order when the postman in her village spotted a letter in her name had been sent to the wrong house.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you want to challenge the debt, you must ask to defend it. This is likely to mean a second hearing.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Once the set aside order has been issued, send two copies to the court of your defence explaining why you should not have to pay.

This gives you a better chance of winning as the judge will only hear your case.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Even if the judge finds against you, if you pay the debt before the deadline set down by the court (typically 14 to 30 days) it won't appear on your credit record.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>IF IT'S NOT REMOVED</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">There's no guarantee that a judge will remove your CCJ.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In this case your only option is to make the best of a bad situation.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">First, clear the debt. CCJs that have been paid can be marked on credit files as 'satisfied', which looks better to a lender.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Apply to the court that issued the judgment for a Certificate of Satisfaction, with evidence the bill has been paid.

It may be time-consuming but the work is likely to pay off. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>John Jones, head of legal practice at TCS, said:</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">One of the distinct advantages of the land registration system in England &amp; Wales is that the property owner's title is based on records kept in an electronic register by HM Land Registry rather than through original deeds and other documents.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">However, for a sizeable minority of unregistered titles, especially those where the property has not been sold or remortgaged since 1990, those bundles of original deeds are the only proof of ownership the owner has and if they go missing or are destroyed then considerable difficulties will be experienced if the owner did look to sell or remortgage his title.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">No such difficulties will be experienced with a registered title.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Deeds that go missing or are destroyed will require the title to be reconstructed or reconstituted.</font></p><img id="i-1a3e892258b1dbc7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/17/12/0DD5089E00000514-0-image-a-20_1471431698203.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="If someone dies and you can't find the deeds to the property, what do you need to do?" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As the number of unregistered titles is diminishing, fewer and fewer lawyers today are working on them. Dealing with unregistered titles is therefore becoming something of a dying art among conveyancers. Where those deeds are missing or destroyed, it is important that owners identify and use only suitably experienced and knowledgeable conveyancers to carry out the reconstitution.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The process can be complex, involve detailed research and investigation.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The purpose of reconstitution is to effect a first registration of title at HM Land Registry by creating a registered title for the property in question. Registration confirms the ownership of the property.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For the conveyancer it is about putting together a jigsaw puzzle where you know, from the start, that the important pieces are missing. You must use other, less important pieces, to produce a picture the Land Registry will accept is close enough to the picture on the puzzle box to allow the person claiming ownership to have his title registered.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Deeds go missing or are destroyed for various reasons. Thousands of titles had to be reconstituted following destruction through enemy action during World War II. In 1998, the Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society had to reconstitute more than 100,000 sets of title deeds when a fire destroyed them at its storage warehouse in Birmingham.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">To reconstitute title the conveyancer has to put together sufficient secondary evidence to allow the Land Registry to determine if registration is possible. Each application is decided on its individual merits &amp; facts.</font></p><img id="i-759365fea2881247" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/17/12/2392968F00000578-0-image-a-19_1471431666518.jpg" height="459" width="306" alt="You need to collect as much evidence as possible to register a property with the Land Registry" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The applicant must establish the circumstances in which the deeds were lost or destroyed, provide the secondary evidence, prove that he or she is in possession of the property and provide evidence of identity (to prevent fraud). Enemy action, fire, flood, domestic accident, burglary or being lost while held by your lawyer or bank are all examples of acceptable circumstances to explain the loss or destruction of the original deeds.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The secondary evidence is used to show how the applicant acquired the property, claims ownership and has possession of it. It will be whatever evidence is available and may include historic letters from the owner's past lawyer, bank statements, mortgage payment books, utility bills, estate agent's particulars of sale, drafts of contracts or conveyances plus statements from neighbours, electoral roll records, and building's insurance policies and so on.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In this case study, steps would be taken to obtain historic documents (as mentioned above) held by the Mother that show when the Father bought the house, and his occupation of it until his death.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If necessary, adverts will be placed in local newspapers and legal journals to see if the deeds can be traced. If we did know the name of the Father's mortgage lender, then contact would be made of that lender or its successor to see if the deeds were still being held by them.</font></p><div class="moduleHalf"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The Mother would complete the ST3 (see below) and the conveyancer will submit a first registration application using Forms FR1 &amp; DL. An application fee will be payable to the Land Registry based on a scale tied to the approximate value of the Property. The Land Registry may well send a surveyor to inspect the property.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">To support the application the owner must provide a Statement of Truth (the Land Registry provides a useful proforma Statement, namely Form ST3) which gives a description of the land (usually by reference to a plan) and details how the deeds went missing or were destroyed, how long is the applicant's period of ownership, who last had possession of the deeds and why, and what steps have been taken to try and locate them. It also must confirm the property is free from mortgage and whether any rights are exercised over it (such as a right of way).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If the deeds went missing or were destroyed while in the custody of a law firm or financial institution then, if satisfied with the evidence, the Land Registry will register the property with an absolute title. If not, then it is usually the case that the property will be registered with a possessory title. Whichever title it is registered with, will, however, make it easier for the owner to prove ownership and deal with his title going forward.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The conveyancer is likely to charge fees based on the amount of time taken to conduct the investigation and prepare the application. On average a reconstitution of title will cost somewhere between £500 and £800 plus vat depending on its complexity. Disbursements will also be payable such as the application fee and search fees. In the Mother's case, she is likely to be registered with a possessory title.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>The Land Registry adds:</strong> On initial inspection, the property appears not to be registered, which means no application for registration has been lodged with us.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Where the title deeds cannot be found, an application for first registration of the property can be made using a Statutory Declaration or Statement of Truth.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The government raked in £4.7billion in inheritance tax in the year to April - up 22 per cent on the  year before and the highest take ever.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Why?

This meant that in practice those who had done no IHT planning often left their nil-rate band unused and lost its benefit.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>Other exemptions </strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The main exemption from IHT is gifts of up to £3,000 each tax year. All gifts under this total annual level made by an individual fall outside of the IHT net.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You can carry forward your annual exemption allowance of £3,000 if you don't use it, but only for one year. That means if you don't use your allowance one year, you can leave £6,000 tax-free the next year. But that won't increase to £9,000 the following year if you don't use it for two years' running.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You can also give away other money tax free. The Gov.uk Inheritance Tax page explains:</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Each tax year, you can also give away:</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>The seven-year rule (and little-known benefit of tapering)</strong></font></p><div class="money floatRHS" id="cae78e80-63a7-11e6-91c1-53281b4fc7db"> <table class="mol-table" data-swipe-article="false" width="100%"> <caption class="wocc">IHT GIFTS: THE SEVEN-YEAR RULE </caption> <tbody>  <tr>   <th>Years between gift and death</th>    <th>Tax paid</th>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>less than 3</td>    <td>40%</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>3 to 4</td>    <td>32%</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>4 to 5</td>    <td>24%</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>5 to 6</td>    <td>16%</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>6 to 7</td>    <td>8%</td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>7 or more</td>    <td>0%</td>   </tr> </tbody> </table></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">There's an additional consideration. If a person  gives away more than £3,000 each tax year - or the other exemptions - and dies within seven years of making that gift, leaving an estate worth more than the nil rate band, it is eligible for inheritance tax.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But despite the misconception that getting to seven years is an all or nothing affair, that is not the case.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The rate imposed on money given away above the nil rate band depends on how long ago the gift was made, due to tapering.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If death occurs within three years of the gift, then 40 per cent tax is payable; between three and four years, it reduces to 32 per cent; between four and five the rate is 24 per cent; between five and six years it's 16 per cent; between six and seven it's 8 per cent and after seven years, no inheritance tax is payable. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For those who know their estates will be hit by inheritance tax, giving money or assets away early can be a wise move if they are in a position to do so.  </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The taxman regards a gift as ‘anything that has a value, eg money, property, possessions’ or even a ‘a loss in value when something’s transferred, eg if you sell your house to your child for less than it’s worth, the difference in value counts as a gift.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>What are the new rules on family homes?</strong></font></p><img id="i-191447edba2af30e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/05/17/3499D60600000578-3720130-image-a-4_1470413787135.jpg" height="223" width="306" alt="Osborne: In 2020/21 a house worth £1 million could theoretically be passed on tax free" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">With house prices now significantly higher than they have been historically, more and more fairly ordinary families are finding themselves over the tax-free threshold when they inherit.  </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The former Chancellor George Osborne wanted to increase the inheritance tax allowance up to £1million to reflect that fact.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But he didn't.

When you trade in your nest egg for an annuity, you want it to be as big as possible - you don't want to risk a big drop in its value just before.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">However, if you're not planning to take all of your pension or buy an annuity when you retire, a drop in value at retirement age is not such a big deal as you still have time to bring it back up again, and it may be worth the risk in exchange for the possibility of higher returns over the longer term.</font></p><img id="i-3e28bc9eacd6d013" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/05/11/36DE962200000578-3725239-image-a-10_1470392682162.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Passing years: If you're well prepared to navigate the years between 55 and 75, you can mostly arrange your transition into retirement to your own liking and individual needs " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you have a final salary or 'defined benefit' pension, which provides guaranteed and usually generous payouts for life, this can be a good time to check what the scheme's 'selected retirement age' is and whether there would be any penalties for retiring early.

It is  topped up by additional state pension entitlements - S2P and Serps - accrued during working years.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This two-tier system has now been changed for anyone retiring from April 2016 onwards, and replaced with a 'flat rate' pension of £155.65 a week. However, people who have contracted out of S2P and Serps over the years <a style="font-weight: bold;" class="" href="/money/pensions/article-3173476/Will-lose-new-state-pension-pay-NI-35-years.html" target="_blank">will get less than this</a>.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Workers needed to have 30 years of qualifying National Insurance contributions to get the old state pension, but require 35 years to get the full flat rate state pension now. However, even if you paid in full for a whole 35 years, if you contracted out for some years on top of that it might still reduce what you get. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Rises in the state pension are presently calculated on the basis of something called the 'Triple Lock'. This means that payouts always increase by whatever is the highest of inflation, average earnings or 2.5 per cent.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Critics have pointed out that the Triple Lock could prove an unsustainable financial commitment in the longer term, but the current Conservative Government has pledged to maintain it during its current term in office.</font></p></div>            </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Just because you can start drawing your state pension, doesn't mean you have to do so at the first opportunity. If you can afford to defer it, your eventual payouts will be bumped by 5.8 per cent for each year you delay.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The increase is now much less generous that it was for those who reached state pension age before 6 April this year, but assuming you are not in immediate need of a retirement income it's still worth doing the sums to see if you would come out ahead.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The Government offers guidance about deferring your state pension <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gov.uk/deferring-state-pension">here</a>.

'Ask your pension department or administrator and check your scheme's pensions handbook if you want to retire early.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He also notes that you could lose protections built into 'section 32 pensions' - where a final salary fund has been converted at some point into an insurance policy - if you don't take the pension on the designated start date. These policies can offer protected tax-free cash which is greater than the usual 25 per cent, depending on your service and salary record.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Defined contribution' work pensions, where you and employer contribute to a pot which can be turned into an income at retirement, can have a 'selected retirement age' too.

The outcome of the EU referendum has convinced me to take the step and I am planning to move back at the end of the year. A friend has told me that I can claim back taxes for all the years I have been working in the UK. Is it true? Can I also ask for my National Insurance contributions to be paid back?For my first seven years in the UK I was employed full-time at different restaurants in London and for the past two years I have been self-employed as a tattoo artist.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>This Is Money</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Jonathon Hopkins</dc:creator><dc:modified>2016-07-23T03:21:20.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>I'm moving back to Italy after Brexit, can I claim back tax and NIC?</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2016-07-23T03:21:20.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Italy,Tax Experts</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/experts/article-3684757/My-partner-took-loan-buy-motorbike-s-told-pay-hand-bike-options.html" title="My partner took out a loan so I could buy a motorbike ¿ now she's told me to pay her back in full or hand over the bike, what are my options?"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/experts/article-3629370/Why-need-buy-travel-insurance-EHIC-cards.html" title="I've just booked our summer holiday to Italy but why do we need to buy travel insurance when we already have EHIC cards?"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/experts/article-3505750/ASK-TONY-retired-2011-working-44-years-nurse-HMRC-says-owe-money-no-savings-pay.html" title="ASK TONY: I retired in 2011 after working 44 years as a nurse but now HMRC says I owe it money but I have no savings to pay"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-3699930/Eurotunnel-expecting-boom-French-shoppers-coming-Britain-advantage-cheap-pound.html" title="Eurotunnel expecting a boom in French shoppers coming to Britain to take advantage of the cheap pound"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/news/article-3699975/Italy-s-banks-hoping-private-rescue-fund-amid-fears-lenders-collapse.html" title="Italy's banks hoping for third private rescue fund amid fears lenders could collapse"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-3698934/Budget-airline-Wizz-Air-chops-growth-plans-direct-result-Brexit.html" title="Budget airline Wizz Air chops growth plans 'as a direct result of Brexit'; Eurotunnel cuts its profit forecasts due to the weak pound"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-national-insurance-record" title="Check your National Insurance record - GOV.UK"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk" title="Tax if you leave the UK to live abroad - GOV.UK"></link></item></channel></rss>
