<p class="mol-para-with-font">When you're considering making renovations to your home, often the thought of adding value to the property when it comes to selling can be a deciding factor. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, experts have revealed that while most improvements will increase the potential asking price, the added value is not always greater than what you spend in the first place. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">GoCompare has teamed up with property expert Henry Pryor who is a regular fixture on <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/bbc/index.html" id="mol-e8829ea0-6998-11e8-a660-fd9861a9f977">BBC</a> Breakfast and Radio 4's Today programme, to identify the upgrades that are really worth your money. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His findings reveal that the most profitable home improvement is installing a new boiler for a cost of £2,000 which will add £8,000 in value, making you a profit of £6,000. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Increasing home security and energy saving measures are also worth your while, but updating bathrooms and kitchens and putting in new flooring won't add more value than what you've spent, leaving you at a loss. </p><img id="i-6cf53ba52423b9b8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/15/4CF97CE100000578-0-image-a-51_1528294216052.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="Installing a new boiler is the most profitable addition you can make to your home, adding £8,000 in value for the cost of less than £2,000" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's therefore that you think carefully why you are spending extra money and who will benefit,' he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'My advice is usually 'spend money on the things that you want and leave other improvements to the next person who may not share your taste. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Most people who are thinking of selling their home or looking to improve it to add value will consider the merits of a trip to the DIY store, some will even consider doing some building work in the hope of adding value but not all buyers will be prepared to pay for your idea of improvements or good taste. </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox femail"

She said that you should always dream big and ask yourself - 'What if your life could be anything that you wanted it to be? What if you could achieve anything that you set your mind to?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alyse said it was a lot of trial and error as well as experimenting with new things but she tries to think of everything as a learning experience because, 'even if something didn't do so well there's always something I can learn from it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A  very important piece of the puzzle that has allowed Alyse to continue growing and expanding she admits is accepting help which she has done a lot over the past few years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I have accepted help from so many different people in so many different ways. The truth is that I haven't done this all on my own that's just not possible. When we open up ourselves and accept help from others we're also opening up ourselves to so much more growth.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for people who are too scared to ask for help, Alyse said, 'I know that it could be hard to ask for support and accept help from others but if we want to grow at a more rapid rate it's essential to allow yourself to receive help.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fourth is prioritizing health which she says  is so important when it comes to manifesting your dreams and achieving your goals.</p><mol-permabox id="mol-5698bfc0-6988-11e8-a04c-7523876330f5"></mol-permabox><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Nutrition is incredibly important because fueling and nourishing your body will help you thrive. Less process food and more fresh food as well as figuring out how many hours of sleep is ideal for you and getting in tune with your body is essential she says. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When I'm feeling good in my mind as well as my body and I feel like I have a clear head, I feel like things manifest and happen so much quicker and easier,' she admits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lastly, Alyse says believing in yourself is key as well as becoming aware of your limiting beliefs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I have spent years trying to get those limiting thoughts and beliefs out of my head. Change the voice in your head and change the story. I can't stress enough how important it is to positively affirm what you are capable of instead of telling yourself that you're not worthy, you're not capable and you're not deserving,' Alyse shared.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You literally need to train yourself to think differently and more positively even if it feels like a lie in the beginning continue on with it anyway. Every single day wake up and tell yourself "I am capable and I am worthy of living in abundance and fulfillment in every single aspect of life,"' she continued.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Alyse Brautigam dropped out of college to pursue her dreams of living in Hawaii arriving with just $500 to her name.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">(Ditto the man who still lives with his parents and has never left home – not that this applies to Grant, but just so you know.)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Grant is often compared to the other (former) famous bachelor, George Clooney, but George did have a brief marriage to actress Talia Balsam before he married Amal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Grant has made no secret of the fact he's not a fan of marriage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Do I think humans are meant to be in a 40-year-long faithful relationship? No, no, no.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unlike women who will often say one thing and mean another, men who say they're anti-marriage, generally are.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Confirmed bachelors like Grant use phrases like 'I like not having to answer to anyone' and 'I like doing what I please' all the time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They also often have routines they don't like to alter.</p><img id="i-1571b46b33a73ca2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/16/4CF0A97A00000578-5807887-image-a-19_1528212343835.jpg" height="463" width="306" alt="Tracey says that being a bachelor is not the same as being a commitment-phobe " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you meet a guy who's never been married who won't change the slightest thing about their life to accommodate you, walk away if a ring is what you're after.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There's hard evidence Grant cheated on Liz Hurley - he was arrested on Sunset Boulevard for receiving oral sex in a public place from sex worker Divine Brown - and wanting to continue to play the field is another reason men give for not wanting to settle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We also know two women – one his now wife Anna - were bearing his sons at the same time, proving there was at least an overlap in his relationship with her and his previous partner (and mother of the other two of his children), Tinglan Hong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Is a bachelor a commitment-phobe?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hugh Grant might have not have believed in the institution of marriage but he definitely doesn't tick the boxes for a commitment-phobe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The two often get lumped in together but there is a difference.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A bachelor doesn't believe in marrying; true commitment phobia is a fear of any kind of commitment that involves other people – not just relationship commitment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Grant was with Liz Hurley for 13 years which is – let's face it - longer than a lot of people's marriages.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He dated socialite Jemima Khan for three years and others for years at a time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More importantly, he and Liz have remained close friends ever since the split with Grant godfather to her son Damian.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He has five children in total: two with former partner Tinglan Hong and three with his now wife.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He reputedly met Tinglan in the bar, had a 'fleeting affair' (according to a statement by his publicist) and the pregnancy was an accident.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He could easily have contested it but didn't.</p><img id="i-871289f34eb1d07d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/16/00E7D1EC00000190-5807887-image-m-21_1528212373002.jpg" height="820" width="634" alt="She points out that Hugh dated Liz Hurley for 13 years, and the pair remained friends after separating with Hugh acting as godfather to her son" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-a3717e5bd8d154a1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/16/064FE4C50000044D-5807887-image-a-22_1528212394771.jpg" height="935" width="634" alt="The actor also dated socialite Jemima Khan for three years and others for years at a time" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Grant might conduct his relationships in a way most don't.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As I said, both Tinglan and Anna were pregnant with his sons at the same time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His first child with Anna, John Mungo, was born in September 2012; his second child with Tinglan, Felix, was born three months later in December 2012.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This didn't come out until a year later, when Grant signed a birth certificate as John Mungo's father, and he was caught on camera seeing both women, apparently simultaneously.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But he didn't shirk his responsibility, acknowledges paternity of all his children and supports them financially.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also has a circle of close friends he's known for years, who are all fiercely supportive of him: few, if any, commitment-phobes can say the same.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They tend to shy away from intimate involvement with anyone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Why now?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So even if he's not a commitment phobe, Grant certainly wasn't a fan of marriage - why bother with a ceremony he doesn't really believe in, six years and three kids into a relationship, three years off hitting 60?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I think it's this simple: the timing is right for him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some people want what he's just signed up for at 25, others don't fancy it until 57.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I got married (albeit for the second time) when I was 55 because I didn't find the person I truly wanted to spend the rest of my life with until then.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sometimes it takes that long – especially if you've got a lot of other stuff going on, like a career.</p><img id="i-2c8fb8a43f845ca2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/16/4CF0A78A00000578-5807887-image-a-23_1528212422114.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Tracey says a partner who is a great mother, as Anna is to three of Hugh's children, is a compelling reason to rethink old beliefs" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Post 50, there's less need to prove ourselves, our libidos calm down and we start to realise our own mortality.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In short, we want different things from life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Things that did not appeal to me at all pre-50 – routine, familiarity, being able to second-guess how your partner will react in pretty much all situations – I now find hugely attractive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Which is a good thing because marriage is all about routine and predictability.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's also reassuring that Grant got married six years into his relationship with Anna.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Saying 'I do' to someone, six years and three children in, is a much stronger, more realistic commitment than one made when you're in the heavy idealization stage of a new relationship, brains flooded with love and sex hormones that remove rational judgement and thought.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having five children also changes you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Grant is known for being miserable and nothing like the dippy, happy characters he played in Richard Curtis movies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Having these kids has transformed him from a very miserable person into a fairly miserable person,' said Hurley, ironically, recently.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's improved him. He's gone up the scale.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Who knows - the whole idea of marriage might well have come from one of the children he has with Anna?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Why Anna?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They have three kids' is the obvious answer to anyone asking why Anna Eberstein was the one to finally tame Grant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A partner who is a great mother is a compelling reason to rethink old beliefs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anna's also bright (she's a Swedish TV producer), comes from good stock (her parents are prominent Swedish judges) and looks good, in a non-flashy way, sporting a bod to die for (and that's after three children).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you believe in the theory that we all fall for someone who looks like us, their face shapes and proportion are remarkably similar.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anna might be successful but she's not a star, so if Grant is a tad narcissistic, there's no competition for the limelight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Watching videos of them together, their body language is impressive: there don't appear to be any power plays going on and they're affectionate without suspiciously over-doing it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just as he's finally getting the roles he's always wanted, perhaps Hugh Grant is entering a more mature, contented stage of his life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I met him once, years ago in a restaurant in Notting Hill.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was sitting at the table next to me and we ended up chatting: he was charming, flirtatious without being creepy and very funny.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was around the time the media were changing their opinion of him: undecided as to whether he was a handsome playboy or seedy womanizer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Maybe I'm biased because of this, maybe it's because his characters (apart from Jeremy Thorpe) are always so loveable, but I've always been fond of him and thought his heart was in the right place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We've all made mistakes and at least he admits his.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some leopards do change their spots and I have every confidence he'll last the distance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Find more advice on sex and love on Tracey's website and her Edge and supersex ranges on <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.lovehoney.co.uk/brands/tracey-cox/">lovehoney.co.uk</a></span></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The British actor Hugh Grant and Anna Eberstein married in an intimate ceremony in Chelsea just over a week ago - here Tracey Cox reveals what prompted him to finally relinquish his 'eternal bachelor' status, and what makes a confirmed bachelor change their mind.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Martha Cliff</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T09:41:56.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Tracey Cox reveals what it took for Anna Eberstein to tame Hugh Grant</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T09:41:56.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5808363/M-S-sends-shoppers-frenzy-15-beauty-box.html" title="M&amp;S sends shoppers into a frenzy with a beauty box containing £135 worth of products for just £15 - and they're already on eBay for six times the price"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/food/article-5807813/Heinz-set-change-Salad-Cream-SANDWICH-Cream-104-years.html" title="Salad Cream set to change its name to SANDWICH Cream after 104 years on supermarket shelves (because so few people use it as a dressing)"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/food/article-5807451/The-perfect-summer-snack-Morrissons-launch-olives-infused-gin-just-2-50.html" title="The perfect summer snack?

exciting parts of becoming a new parent. However, due to a number of unusual and offensive choices made by parents in the past, governments in both Australia and New Zealand have had to ban a number of 'names' from being registered. Here, FEMAIL looks at the names banned from use across the two countries and reasons why certain monikers have been prohibited. Names like Saint (top right is Saint West with Kim Kardashian) and Queen (bottom right is Queen Elizabeth) are banned due to royal and religious connotations.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Sheree Mutton</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T08:47:19.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>The baby names BANNED after parents tried to use them</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T08:47:19.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5801823/Constance-Hall-shares-post-baby-bump-just-days-giving-birth-son-Raja-Wolf.html" title="'I still look six months pregnant but I'm going to flaunt it everywhere I go': Constance Hall shares photo of her post-baby bump to break stigma for new mums just days after giving birth to her son Raja Wolf"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5769565/The-Australian-baby-names-2018-revealed.html" title="From Bodhi and Jude to Luna and Isla: The top Australian baby names for 2018 revealed - and the monikers that are gone for GOOD"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.bdm.vic.gov.au/home/births/name+your+child/" title="Name your child - Births, Deaths &amp; Marriages Victoria"></link></item><item><title>Red hot!

And to live out her 'doll life,' she plans out three hours a day to become her doll self and wears her full doll look four to six days a week. She said: 'I think my look is really about self expression and I like being a doll because that means I can be whatever I want that day. I am pretty much using my body as the canvas to express how I am feeling.' She added that her style is a mix up of 'whimsical fairy tale Harijuku fashion that stemmed from goth, and is running into neon lights, leaving a trail of glitter'.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Charlie Lankston</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-05T17:20:13.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Meet the woman who spends hours on her makeup to transform into a doll</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-05T17:20:13.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5064137/Make-artist-transforms-living-Bratz-doll.html" title="Life in plastic!

But if there first child is a girl, she will simply be called 'Lady'. In 2013, the Succession to the Crown Act changed the law regarding succession to the throne so it is based on birth order, regardless of gender.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Jane Austen’s novels and Love Island are essentially the same thing; popular entertainment with the sole premise of following a number of couples on their path to finding love,' says Helen. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The rules and conventions governing their courtships are remarkably similar. So here, for the benefit of the class of 2018, are some rules for romance, as shared by Jane Austen and Love Island.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium femail-ccox mol-style-bold">1. First impressions are usually wrong</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Love Island begins with the girls choosing a boy to couple-up with, based on their first impression as they enter the villa. This almost never leads to them "cracking-on" and they usually seize the opportunity to dump them at the very first re-coupling. </p><img id="i-be77b40cd9dce940" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/14/013EC95100001005-5803267-image-a-49_1528117641128.jpg" height="410" width="634" alt="First impressions are often wrong, notes Helen, pointing to Lizzy Bennet and Mr Darcy (played here by Matthew Macfadyen and Keira Knightley in Joe Wright's 2005 film adaptation)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-e57984275421c746" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/14/179A13CE00000514-5803267-image-a-50_1528117648250.jpg" height="357" width="634" alt="Last year's winners Kem Cetinay and Amber Davies may have got off to a rocky start but they went on to win over fans.

I have sensitive skin, but the range is 100 per cent natural. Plus, it is super hydrating — vital for mature skin. I love the Shea Butter, Jojoba, Almond &amp; Nutmeg Day Cream, which feels light and non-greasy (£5.35, crafthouseindia.com). I’ve converted my whole family!</p><div>

My friend bought me a session at a stately home for my birthday and I’ve been hooked ever since. Now I go once a week: it’s an exhilarating workout and you really feel the part in all the gear. My arms and thighs have so much more definition now. Plus, it’s a low-impact sport, so ideal for taking up in midlife.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>TREAT YOUR FEET</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Every month, I get a pedicure at my local salon. My favourite colour is an elegant midnight plum, which flatters my skin tone. I even get it done in winter — I don’t care if no one else knows!

I went back to university to do a degree in fine art when I was 36, while bringing up young children. It was my escape and I discovered a whole new side to myself. Now I’ve built a studio at home and paint every weekend for fun. It’s my favourite way to de-stress and unwind.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Do you look good for your age?

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Writing this, I am imbued with that bone-weary yet satisfied feeling that comes after a good swim. A swimming class, actually, at my local lido. Two kilometres of 50-metre lengths as a warm-up, then various front-crawl drills involving one arm then the other, hand paddles and pull buoys.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet though sheepish to confess it, these Swim Doctor sessions have become a weekly highlight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The gently competitive camaraderie of a class has been revelatory. We each have strengths and weaknesses, but take the plunge and feel better for it.</p><img id="i-d63f2a57c0ca195d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/22/4CE2E85700000578-5801231-image-a-54_1528061282982.jpg" height="925" width="634" alt="The Lido by Libby Paige is one of the books recommended by author Patricia Nicol as she shares her favourite reads about swimming" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rosemary, the 86-year-old swimmer at the centre of Libby Page’s The Lido, knows all this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When she meets the novel’s protagonist, Kate, a stressed journalist in her mid-20s, she agrees to be interviewed only if Kate first swims in the unheated Brockwell Lido.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There was something about Kate that made Rosemary feel she was in great need of a swim.’ The two women become friends, united through their campaign to save their lido from developers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In John Cheever’s rightly classic American short story, The Swimmer, Ned Merrill, who ‘had an inexplicable contempt for men who did not hurl themselves into pools’ is out drinking at friends, one hot Sunday, when he resolves to swim home through the ‘quasi-subterranean stream’ of his wealthy neighbourhood’s pools.</p><img id="i-4e935b8cb3cc1a51" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/22/4CE2E84C00000578-5801231-image-a-55_1528061289460.jpg" height="970" width="634" alt="She also recommends Barracuda, which portrays a teenage swimming prodigy called Danny" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The day was beautiful, and it seemed to him that a long swim might enlarge and celebrate its beauty . . .’ The day and Ned start off jubilant, but the mood darkens as it becomes clear that Ned is actually drowning in problems.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Danny, the teenage protagonist of Australian Christos Tsiolkas’s Barracuda is a swimming prodigy, ‘not only is he in the water but he has become water’. But the pressure to compete destroys Danny, making him phobic about the very thing that once felt freeing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For me, swimming is a mental and physical workout.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no attempt to gloss over the relatively advanced age of the groom. He certainly doesn't try to pass himself off as younger than his years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, John Fareham, a 59-year-old local councillor in Hull and the former Lord Mayor of the city, jokes about his creaky physical state.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I did manage to get down on one knee to propose and at my age the difficulty is getting up again, but I managed it with a spring in my step.'</p><img id="i-c4b7e9ef49698e89" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/21/4CE28BE400000578-5801349-image-m-6_1528058547555.jpg" height="867" width="634" alt="John Fareham, 59, is a local councillor in Hull. Parliamentary candidate Dehenna Davidson is just 24 and has never had a serious relationship, but the couple are getting married " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">His bride Dehenna, who is just 24, tries to sum up why this — her first serious boyfriend — is the man she wants to spend the rest of her life with.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I don't know if you can always put your finger on what it is about this person that you love,' she says. 'We just click. I couldn't think of anyone I'd rather spend my time with. I have no doubt that he's going to be a great husband.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But not everyone is as chilled out about a union that involves a 35-year age difference. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dehenna lost her dad at 13, so the main father figure in her life has been her grandfather Paul, who is just eight years older than the man she is going to marry. It's fair to say he is not thrilled about the union.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Initially, I wanted to go out and strangle him,' says Paul, who is a no-nonsense truck driver. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fairness, he looks as if he could easily strangle the bespectacled and besuited John, a gentle and bookish type.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I know you've got your Rod Stewarts and your Mick Jaggers, but I don't understand why she'd be so attracted to him,' Paul rages, baffled as to why his pretty granddaughter would want to marry such a man. 'She's young enough and pretty enough to be with someone her own age.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">John, Dehenna (who is also known as Dee) and Paul are three of the people who are taking part in a rather jaw-dropping new documentary series on Channel 4 which revolves around couples who want to marry even when the idea of their union horrifies their families.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bride &amp; Prejudice follows six couples whose choice of partner has not gone down well with their inner circle, filming them in the build-up to their weddings as tension rises. </p><img id="i-7e4cea59a45fb378" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/21/4CE28BC200000578-5801349-image-a-4_1528058536257.jpg" height="443" width="634" alt="Chloe and Jack (pictured) have been together for two years.

Will Paul fulfil Dee's wishes and not only attend the wedding, but give a speech in place of her late father?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Each family has a different reason for not wanting the wedding to go ahead, whether it be the couple's gap in ages, racial or religious differences, or because the chosen partner is the wrong sex.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So heated do the arguments get that you do end up wondering if there will be any weddings at all to celebrate by the end. Yet the more we get to know John and Dee, the more they seem genuinely smitten.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They met when Dee, then a political researcher from Sheffield, attended a campaign event he was speaking at. It wasn't love at first sight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He said 'hello' and was very pleasant before waving me on to get on with work, which is very John-ish really,' she says. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their paths crossed several more times, but they insist they were just friends for a whole year before their relationship turned serious.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'At first, you start realising that something might be happening here, but I put it out of my mind,' admits John. 'The idea was absurd. It's the cliche isn't it, a man of my age and a younger woman.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">John has been married before, but divorced for 20 years. 'I thought at my age it was never going to happen again.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Actually, they make a very well-suited couple. Dee seems older than her years, at least in attitude if not looks, but both admit they knew they were walking into the lion's den — not least because of John's public profile and Dee's own political ambitions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During their engagement, she stood for political officer herself, as the Tory candidate for Tony Blair's old Sedgefield seat. </p><img id="i-e2ade3efe0a87d9c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/21/4CE28BF600000578-5801349-image-a-8_1528058567816.jpg" height="357" width="634" alt="Rob (left) has already been married to his childhood sweetheart.

'You have the thing of the younger woman with quite a wealthy older guy. You think, 'Is that what people are going to think of me?' '</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">John shakes his head violently. He certainly isn't in Mick Jagger territory in terms of wealth, either.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there is the question of children. Her grandfather is visibly distressed at the idea that she will have John's children, given that by the time those children are at school, he will be approaching retirement age.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I would like Dehenna to have children, but not with John,' says Paul. 'He will be taking the children to school with everyone thinking he is the grandad.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no doubt from the off that this wedding is going ahead, and, despite his reservations, Paul has agreed to attend.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, Dee is desperate for him to give the marriage his seal of approval by giving a speech.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet even on the morning of the wedding, when she is spinning around in her 'Cinderella shoes', he has not decided if he can do that. Other stories of conflict are interwoven over three episodes in the series.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over in Cambridgeshire, the parents of builder Rob, who is 38, are having real trouble getting their heads around his forthcoming wedding. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They have already attended one wedding as parents-of-the-groom. </p><img id="i-754de834373d54e1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/21/4CE28BD700000578-5801349-image-a-7_1528058564252.jpg" height="554" width="634" alt="Jamie and Shaaba, 23, from Essex, have been inseparable since they were 16.

But it ended after only three and a half years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Rob announced that he was seeing someone again, his mum's reaction was a breezy: 'Who is she this time?' But it wasn't a 'she', it was a 'he'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When we meet Rob and his new partner Simon, 31, who met via online dating, his parents are not only in shock, but denial.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While Rob is fuming about the fact they can't get excited about napkins and floral arrangements ('I wouldn't say they've taken a back seat; they've taken no seat' he says about their attitude to the wedding), they still can't process the fact that their son is suddenly (in their eyes) gay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Watching the filmed encounters between mother, father and son does make you rather feel like you have stumbled into an Alan Partridge sketch, such is the cringe factor. The differences between the generations are laid bare.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You don't wake up one day and think, 'Oh I wonder if I'll have a gay son,' ' admits Rob's dad Steve. 'It just lands on your doorstep and you have to deal with it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Suffice to say they are dealing with it very badly. Neither has been able to tell their friends that their son is gay, or share the happiness of the forthcoming wedding.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I feel a sort of embarrassment,' admits Steve. 'It's not like going around saying, 'I've won the lottery' is it? I'm dreading the moment where the minister says 'you may now kiss the . . . the groom . . . the bride . . . the what?' ' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The core of the problem is they simply don't believe their son is gay. 'If he was a genuine gay you would notice it from a very early age,' says Steve. 'Limp hands,' nods his wife, Linda who cares massively what the neighbours think.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They reminisce about how clearly heterosexual Rob used to be. 'When he was growing up he used to bring some cracking birds round,' says Steve.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There's an extraordinary showdown when Rob confronts them and they tell him that it isn't just them that don't believe he is gay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Nan doesn't believe it either,' they say.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Well she will when she sees us snogging at the wedding,' hits back Rob.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His dad can't countenance this. 'You aren't going to do that, that's . . . ' he splutters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Disgusting?' volunteers Rob, exasperated and hurt.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His husband-to-be, whose own mother is excited about the wedding, is furious. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I want to scream from the rooftops for them to sort themselves out,' says Simon. 'If they can't support us, I'd prefer them not to be there, but he (Rob) wants them there regardless.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the most astonishing stories, which unfolds in Essex, involves the union of 23-year-old students Jamie and Shaaba, who met at the age of 16 and are inseparable. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Shaaba is from quite a strict Muslim family and her mother Faye always wanted, nay expected, her to marry a man from within their Mauritian community. Jamie certainly does not fit the bill.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm not meaning to be racist but he is . . . white,' says Faye, who is an estate agent and quite happy to go on camera to share her disgust.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She has four daughters and has always been quite strict about the boyfriend issue.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We are old-fashioned. We believe in no sex before marriage, we don't encourage boyfriends.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shaaba sighs. 'Mum has a very set idea of the sort of man she wants for me. Someone who is brown, basically.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there is another objection that perhaps goes some way to explain the strength of Faye's disapproval. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We only learn halfway through the programme that Jamie is also transgender. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was not only born a girl but, when his friendship with Shaaba began, it was very much a female friendship.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'She came and stayed in our house,' says Faye, explaining that there is no way, under her strict no-boyfriend rules, that she would have countenanced such a thing had she known there was a relationship imminent between the two — or a sex change in the offing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet within six months of meeting Shaaba, Jamie had had an operation to remove her breasts and was taking testosterone to transition to a male. Shaaba has no issue with her partner's past.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You are a man. I am a girl. This is a straight relationship,' she says to Jamie on camera.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Quite a bit for a mother to get her head around, though, and, frankly Faye can't. 'It is heartbreaking,' she says, as the wedding preparations begin. 'I was very angry. I even disowned her at one point.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Where will they go from here? As Shaaba puts it: 'If anyone else was racist and transphobic and homophobic, I would drop them no question. But she's my mum.' And yes, she wants Faye at her wedding. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As does 20-year-old Chloe, who lives in Aldershot. She has been with her partner Jack, also 20, for two years. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He proposed just six months after they got together and they are now, despite not having any money, deep in confetti and table setting plans.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her mother Debra is appalled. 'I just didn't think she would be at this stage at this age. I thought she would be getting a steady job, a driving licence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They are all swept up in the moment and I don't think Chloe is mature enough to make an informed decision. For that matter, neither is Jack.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no way Debra, who herself married young — and lived to regret it — will support this marriage. 'I'm prepared to say, 'I'm your mother and no, you can't do this,' ' she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chloe pulls a face. 'I don't think we are too young to get married. I think that's a load of c***.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As their story unfolds, you can see why Debra has such concerns. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She first met Jack when Chloe brought him home as a friend, explaining he was a homeless orphan and had nowhere else to go. Big-hearted Debra let him move in, making sure she grilled her daughter on the true nature of their relationship.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was no romance, was there? Chloe assured her there was not. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The truth only came out when she saw her daughter had changed her Facebook status to 'in a relationship', and she went into her bedroom to confront her, finding her and Jack cuddled up on the bed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It then emerged that Jack's parents weren't dead after all, and he had concocted that story to get a place in a hostel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Little wonder Debra has objections to this wedding.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most of these weddings do go ahead, we can reveal (although we have agreed not to reveal whether the disgusted relatives all attend), but the programme is a timely reminder that along with the confetti of a wedding also comes conflict. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Happy ever afters sometimes seem a long way off.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bride &amp; Prejudice is on Channel 4 at 9pm tomorrow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Nothing sparks a family rift like an 'unsuitable' love match.

If you eat based on emotional hunger, your body will never feel satisfied by food. This is why many people think that they never feel full – they never get the signal to stop eating because they were hungry for emotional fulfilment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An emotion is a bit like someone knocking on your door to deliver a message. If the message is urgent, it knocks loudly; if it’s very urgent, it knocks very loudly; if it is very urgent and you don’t answer the door, it knocks louder, and louder, and louder until you open the door or it breaks it down. Either way, the emotion will continue to come up until it’s done its job. If you eat to try to control your feelings, you’re just trying to squash the feeling with food, and the feeling will just pop back up again, which will mean you have to eat on it again and so the cycle continues. But if you were to ‘open the door’ by listening to the real emotional message and take appropriate action, the emotion will often go away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The good news is that with an understanding of what causes emotional eating, you don’t have to be a victim of it anymore. In future, if you are tempted to go and eat a snack, stop and ask yourself this question:<strong> </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Am I really hungry, or do I just want to change the way I feel?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If it turns out that what you actually want is a change in the way that you feel, no amount of food will work as well as applying the simple techniques we are about to do.<strong> </strong></p><video preload="none" id="7839016561553486766" title="Paul McKenna on how to get freedom from emotional eating" poster="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/09/4CBF090400000578-0-image-m-10_1527668937782.jpg">

  </video><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>First, try this technique:</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many people find that when they’re feeling emotional distress or overwhelm and they want to comfort eat to change how they feel, that listening to my hypnotic trance makes all the difference. The hypnotic trance that is available here at Mail Online for seven days, will help you to relax and feel so comfortable that you won’t need to use food to change how you feel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>EMOTIONAL EATERS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are many different types of emotional eater. Many used food as a comfort when they had difficulties or even trauma in their childhood. Some started using food to cope with stress. Some people who have survived abuse found that being overweight protected them from further abuse. There are different routes to emotional eating and different emotional eaters have different relationships with their food.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">· Some have been dieters but have failed to keep the weight off in the long term.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">· Some are happy with their actual weight but are continually stressed around food because they are trying to maintain that weight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">· Some eat healthily for three weeks and then go crazy for a week, and as a result carry more kilos than they want.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All have discovered that whatever happens, they can rely on eating to make themselves ‘feel’ better. Their biggest challenge is not food, or weight, but feelings.</p><img id="i-b82b4e78a7dd2b12" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/16/4CBAC00C00000578-5783239-As_part_of_his_Slim_Down_For_Summer_series_Paul_McKenna_is_givin-m-5_1527607337784.jpg" height="1162" width="634" alt="As part of his Slim Down For Summer series Paul McKenna is giving readers healthy eating tips " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>FIVE QUESTIONS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If ever you have an emotion which seems challenging in any way, ask yourself these five questions. These questions work with any emotions at all – whether enjoyable or uncomfortable – but people mainly use them with the painful ones because they want to change them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just ask the questions and answer as best you can. Sometimes the answers seem totally obvious, sometimes they seem utterly baffling. In the end, it turns out that doesn’t matter. We just try to answer them as best we can at the time, and as more is revealed, we answer them better and better. Here they are:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="femail-ccox">1. What is the trigger of this emotion?</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="femail-ccox">2. What is the belief or judgement included in this emotion?</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="femail-ccox">3. What is the need or care beneath this emotion?</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="femail-ccox">4. What is the positive intention behind this emotion?</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="femail-ccox">5. What is the first practical action I can take now to fulfil the positive intention</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>BE AS SCEPTICAL AS YOU LIKE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A few people have said to me, "I used your system to try to prove you wrong, because I couldn't believe it would work. But it did.” If you follow my instructions, it works.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, if you are sceptical, carry on. Don't take anything for granted. Believe in this approach only when you have the physical evidence from your own body and your own life that you can eat less, weigh less, and feel better without missing out and without using food to control your feelings. Then, you are not reliant on beliefs, or outside help, or faith. Instead, you will gain the confidence and sense of achievement you deserve because you have achieved success by your own actions and power of your own unconscious mind.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Safe</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The hypnotic trance will start the process of change in your unconscious mind and establish the basis of safe new ways to experience your emotions. For the next seven days, you can use my Freedom From Emotional Eating hypnotic trance here at Mail Online for free. I hope you enjoy the changes in your thinking and emotions that you want from the trance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For information about Paul McKenna’s new online weight loss course <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.paulmckennaonline.com/slimdownforsummer">click here</a> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>EXCLUSIVE: Slim Down For Summer.

Actresses Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis, Kim Cattrall, and Cynthia Nixon immediately became household names. Since then, their careers have seen TV and movie roles, fashion collaborations, and even—in Cynthia's case—a pivot to politics. The show, which was viewed as many as revolutionary for how freely it discussed female sexuality, has left a durable mark on pop culture, and it has become common to hear someone define themselves as either a Carrie, a Samantha, a Charlotte, or a Miranda. All four actresses, of course, cemented Sex and the City's legacy by starring in the two movies derived from the show, released respectively in 2008 and 2010.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Charlie Lankston</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-01T23:55:59.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Sex and the City: Where are they now?</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-01T23:55:59.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content></item><item><title>Did they shrink in the wash?

The team made headlines in May when they wore matching Thom Browne suits to a game. The tradition to wear matching suits was started by Dwyane Wade before he was traded and his now being spearheaded by LeBron.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Charlie Lankston</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-01T18:52:29.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>LeBron James wore a shorts suit to Game 1 of the NBA Finals</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-01T18:52:29.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nba/article-5794491/LeBron-James-tells-reporter-better-tomorrow-J-R-Smith-quiz.html" title="'Do better tomorrow': LeBron James' message for reporters as he coolly walks out of press conference with his sunglasses and man bag after repeatedly being grilled over Cavs' clanger in NBA Finals "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5794125/Hilarious-memes-mock-JR-Smith-Cavaliers-guard-mistakenly-thought-team-ahead.html" title="'How you hearing yanny?': Hilarious memes mock JR Smith after Cavaliers guard mistakenly thought his team was ahead with seconds to play in a tie game - drawing priceless reaction from exasperated LeBron James"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5793607/Tristan-Thompson-shoves-ball-face-Warriors-player-ejection-overtime-NBA-FInals.html" title="Tristan Thompson shoves ball in face of Warriors player after ejection during overtime of NBA Finals"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/style/cleveland-cavaliers-lebron-james-thom-browne-.html" title="In the N.B.A., a Game of Clothes Horse - The New York Times"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.gq.com/story/cleveland-cavaliers-thom-browne-breakdown" title="Are the Cleveland Cavaliers’ Stylish-as-Hell Thom Browne Suits Helping? | GQ"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2018/05/31/nba-finals-why-did-lebron-james-wear-shorts-suit-game-1/662227002/" title="www.usatoday.com..."></link></item></channel></rss>
