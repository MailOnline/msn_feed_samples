<p class="mol-para-with-font">Eating disorders affect at least 30 million Americans and have the highest mortality rates of any mental disorder. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those who survive eating disorders often have a long, difficult journey ahead of them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eating disorders are classified as mental illnesses characterized by severe disruptions in eating behaviors. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In our diet-focused culture, many people may not realize that eating disorders still take a huge toll.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As someone who has conducted extensive research and writing in the field of eating disorder recovery, and who has ongoing personal experience in eating disorder recovery, I have found that although full recovery from an eating disorder is possible, it can take time and often requires much action. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There can be many causes of eating disorders, including genetics, personality, trauma, or often a combination of causes. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But by the time a person gets diagnosed by a doctor or therapist, the immediate causes are less relevant than how to recover. Consistent healthy habits are helpful in the recovery process.</p><img id="i-9c975f622decd06c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/15/4CD27A1C00000578-5812649-image-a-1_1528294493290.jpg" height="429" width="634" alt="By the time most people are diagnosed with an eating disorder, they are too far in to their dieting habits that recovery is incredibly difficult" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Ditch the diet</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The most important action that a person can take to recover from eating disorders is to stop dieting. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Weight loss dieting is the number one cause of eating disorders, binge eating, body dissatisfaction and low self-esteem. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In contrast, weight-neutral self-care approaches – that is, focusing on maintaining one's current weight – have been found to assist in eating disorder recovery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But ditching the diet is only the first step. It is necessary to investigate and address factors that maintain eating disorders.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Let go of safety behaviors</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many people in partial recovery from eating disorders still rely on behaviors that help them feel safe, or less anxious, about their weight or appearance. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These so-called safety behavior scan vary but might include monitoring food intake, monitoring weight, double-checking nutritional values, being very careful about food ingredients, and avoiding eating in social situations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The short-term anxiety-reducing benefits of safety behaviors are part of what makes them so hard to eliminate. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unfortunately, safety behaviors create a distraction and leave the eating disorder itself unchallenged.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In order to stop engaging in the safety behaviors that serve to maintain eating disorders, it is important to find alternate ways of thinking and acting around food, eating, body and weight. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Strategies to reach full eating disorder recovery include letting go of safety behaviors and engaging in more self-trust and self-care.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Self-weighing is a safety behavior that maintains the overvaluation of weight, which is part of the American Psychiatric Association's definition of eating disorders. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Continued concern with weight or shape at the end of treatment has been found to be a strong predictor of relapse back into an eating disorder. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A powerful strategy to reduce overvaluation of weight is to consider a personal 30-day 'no weigh' experiment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other safety behaviors that aim at gaining information about one's shape or size – such as mirror checking, pinching the fat on one's torso, feeling muscles or bone, engaging in social size comparison, and seeking reassurance from others about one's body – all have to be considered for elimination. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Each one of these examples can be a safety behavior that serves to maintain undue concern with one's weight and shape, and in turn, keeps the eating disorder alive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Practice self-trust</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Practicing self-trust around eating means giving oneself unconditional permission to eat when hungry, whatever foods are desired, in the amount desired. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Research has shown that unconditional permission to eat is the exact opposite of an eating disorder. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It can be anxiety-producing to give oneself unconditional permission to eat, but it turns out that any kind of food rules, including limits on when, what and how much to eat, led research participants to be more preoccupied with food. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Food rules prompted participants to have a much higher tendency to overindulge, especially when they broke one of their food rules. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the other hand, research participants who allowed themselves to eat when hungry and to choose foods and amounts they desired had a lower tendency to overindulge or engage in binge eating.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Trusting one's body to direct eating choices is one aspect of self-trust. Self-trust also extends to many other self-care practices.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Engage in self-care</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A person's individual relationship with their own body is the 'doorway to pathology', meaning if that relationship is not a positive one, a person is at risk of developing an eating disorder. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In order to fully recover from an eating disorder, this doorway must be filled with positive self-care practices. People in recovery can learn to engage in self-care practices that do not contain any elements of self-harm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Overindulgence in food contains both elements of self-care and self-harm. Self-care involves tuning in and listening to body signals and responding in helpful ways. For instance, being 'tired' could elicit telling yourself to 'rest a bit' or 'turn off the light and go to sleep now.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The feeling of being 'very uncomfortable' could signal it's 'time to change this situation,' and the feeling of being 'overwhelmed' could mean it's 'time to take a break' or 'time to make a list,' depending on the situation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These responses are all dependent on the assumption of self-trust. One has to trust that the body does not lie. Our bodies tell us what we need to know and responding to their messages can help us to fully recover from eating disorders</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Take some risks</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It can feel scary to let go of safety behaviors and to replace them with self-care based on self-trust. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Change is inherently risky. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But for positive change to occur, it is necessary to take some risks. And it is worth it, because full recovery involves more than just letting go of eating disorder and safety behaviors. It also involves feeling better about oneself.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Research participants who had reached full eating disorder recovery had positive self-concepts. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those who were fully recovered from eating disorders showed higher levels of self-esteem, self-efficacy, or a person's belief in his or her ability to succeed at a task, and self-directedness than those who were not in recovery or those who were in partial recovery. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another research study showed that the more positive ways that participants were able to think about themselves, the less likely they were to drop out of eating disorder treatment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Taking risks to trust one's body and to engage in responsive self-care are almost guaranteed to lead to an improved self-concept. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Taking these risks can be anxiety-producing in the short run but worth it, to reach full eating disorder recovery.</p><div class="mol-html" id="mol-b99cde40-6991-11e8-b758-37d6c46c1c1f">                            <div></div>                        </div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Catherine Gillespie, Associate Dean at Drake University, has spent years researching eating disorders - and has her own personal experience with it.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Accidental injury is one of the biggest single causes of death in the UK for children over the age of one - and kills more than leukaemia and meningitis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Every year, around 2 million children attend A&amp;E due to accidents. Around 76,000 of these require admission to hospital - the equivalent of 1,500 each week. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, in a piece for <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.hippocraticpost.com/paediatrics/how-safe-is-your-home/">The Hippocratic Post</a> for Child Safety Week, a first aid expert reveals that falls, burns, choking, suffocation, poisoning and drowning are the six most common childhood accidents. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Emma Hammett, founder of First Aid for Life, explains the simple safety precautions that all households can easily adopt to minimise the risk of children having accidents.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She argues that children should never be over-protected or wrapped in cotton wool because they need to take measured risks and the inevitable bumps and bruises are a healthy part of growing up. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, it is vitally important to have the knowledge to anticipate and prevent serious childhood injuries that can cause long-term damage and have life-changing consequences. </p><img id="i-c7f2d2e2321b5fbf" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/09/4CF7B7A500000578-5811529-Accidental_injury_is_one_of_the_greatest_causes_of_death_in_the_-a-1_1528274425239.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Accidental injury is one of the greatest causes of death in the UK for children over one" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Being one step ahead</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Children develop at different rates; they reach milestones at totally different times and some miss out stages altogether. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You will know your child well but may not anticipate at what point they will suddenly roll, become mobile or be able to reach new heights.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is exciting to see how quickly children grow, and to revel in new developments such as grabbing things, rolling over, crawling, standing, climbing, opening bottles and turning handles. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, it’s when these new abilities take us by surprise that serious childhood accidents can result.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When my children were younger, we had regular visits from older cousins and friends’ children. This gave us some insight into the next stages for our little ones. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Things of no interest to our children, or things way out of their reach, became a source of fascination for our visitors. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anticipating possible risks was incredibly useful as it meant we were always one step ahead in the battle to stay safe! </p><div>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Few foods cause as much confusion as smoothies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, they're delicious and yes, they're full of fruit. But they've also been criticised for being high in sugar, wrecking our teeth and even making us fat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what is the truth? Should we all be slurping down a daily dose of crushed fruits or steering well clear?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It may surprise you to read this, but as a public-health nutritionist, I actually believe smoothies have had a rough time in the press.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In my opinion, they provide a portable, convenient source of fruit and are a useful way to top up our fruit and veg intakes.</p><img id="i-bdffe5259ad2b77f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/08/4CF63A6A00000578-0-image-a-10_1528269625818.jpg" height="424" width="634" alt="Smoothies have been criticised for being high in sugar, leading to weight gain (stock)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Government nutrition guidelines state that a 150ml smoothie counts as one of our recommended five portions of fruit and veg a day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And given that fewer than a third of adults and just eight per cent of teenagers in the UK meet the 5-a-day target for fruit and vegetables – most manage just two or three portions – a smoothie at breakfast or lunchtime can easily help more people add an extra fruit portion to their day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not least because research now shows they can be as good as fruit when it comes to providing nutrients.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, smoothies contain a host of valuable nutrients – including folate, potassium, vitamin A, vitamin C and zinc – that many people don't get enough of.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, 75 per cent of women and girls have low levels of folate – a vitamin vital for normal cell division and the prevention of birth defects – while a fifth of adults have low intakes of potassium - a mineral crucial for muscle and nerve function, and the maintenance of normal blood pressure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not only that, but there is now increasing evidence that smoothies have been unfairly maligned for various reasons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, I reveal some of the latest research – and clarify common misconceptions…</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MYTH: Smoothies are just posh fruit juices</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Smoothies are often unfairly lumped with fruit juices, but they actually have a completely different structure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, studies looking closely at the structure of a well-known commercially available brand of smoothies – innocent - found their cell structure is just like chewed fruit. And that makes sense, as no one swallows an apple whole!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many smoothies provide 2-to-4g of fibre in a 250ml serving, which is far higher than 100 per cent fruit juice which contains just 0.5g per 250ml.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is important because a lack of fibre is one of the most overlooked dietary gaps in the UK – a staggering 90 per cent of us do not get enough.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dietary fibre is important for a range of health reasons extending far beyond digestion. It can regulate blood glucose response, lower cholesterol levels and new evidence shows it could have a positive effect on gut microbiota, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alongside this, increased dietary fibre has been linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MYTH: Smoothies don't fill you up/Smoothies cause a spike in blood sugar leveals</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Due to smoothies being blended fruit – meaning the body doesn't have to break down the fruit itself – it's often claimed that smoothies have a high glycaemic index (GI); something that causes blood sugar to spike and has been linked with a host of conditions ranging from diabetes to heart disease and cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the latest research shows this not  the case.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's also often incorrectly believed that fibre is lost during smoothie processing. But again, the latest research suggests otherwise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fibre is key here as it is known to reduce the GI of food and drinks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Research carried out at the University of Leeds has shown that the cell wall structures of fruits - which are one of the most fibrous parts – do remain intact after smoothie processing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The experiments carried out also showed the cell wall structures were similar to those found in crushed fruits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, research at Oxford Brookes University has found that some smoothies (specifically strawberry and banana and mango and passionfruit) retain a considerable amount of fibre after processing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is often thought smoothies have a high GI due to the presence of natural fruit sugars which are 'released' during the production process.</p><img id="i-3f887e0ffcc28d84" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/08/4CF63A4C00000578-0-image-a-2_1528269597332.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Smoothies have had a 'rough time in the press', according to Dr Emma Derbyshire (stock)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, what we are actually seeing here is that the dietary fibre naturally present in fruits appears to be being retained during smoothie processing, which has a glycaemic-lowering response.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Furthermore, new research from Bristol University, published in the journal Nutrients last month, found drinking a smoothie before eating a meal can reduce the number of calories consumed later on in the day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Specifically, the study examined the satiety effects – i.e. how hunger satisfying – smoothies were compared with water, squash and regular fruit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The researchers found that smoothies and fruits were similar in how they filled us up and reduced feelings of hunger.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Smoothies also had an officially 'low' GI of below 40. An apple, for example, has a GI of 38.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This research is great news, as until now, we didn't really know whether smoothies were regarded as more of a drink or a food.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These results show that young adults see them as being more 'food like', which means other foods are less likely to be eaten.</p><mol-permabox id="mol-3ca1b090-695b-11e8-b493-fd01660eb44b"></mol-permabox><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MYTH: Smoothies are bad for your teeth</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Contrary to popular belief, there is no significant difference between eating whole and juiced fruit when it comes to the effect on our teeth, according to research carried out by the Leeds Dental Health Institute and published in the journal Caries Research.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Specifically, the research looked at 'demineralising' of the enamel and the effects of sugars when comparing whole or juiced apples, oranges, grapes, carrots and tomatoes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dental experts believe that any fruit or drinks that contain sugars or acids - including fruit - could damage your teeth if you do not look after them properly. So always brush your teeth twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Also, only consume foods and drinks that contain sugars or acids at mealtimes, use a straw while drinking them and avoid swishing liquids around your mouth,' advises Professor Robin Seymour, from the School of Dental Sciences at Newcastle University.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MYTH: Smoothies can lead to weight gain</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no secret as to why we put on weight – if we eat or drink more calories than we need, then our bodies store them for later, no matter where the extra calories come from. The crucial thing is to get the balance right.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, several studies have shown that children and adults who drink fruit juice actually have better quality diets and higher intakes of certain vitamins and minerals. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other work shows fruit juice has a neutral effect on blood sugar levels and is not linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also, because smoothies are packed with nutrients, with each calorie that you consume via a smoothie, you also get important nutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin C, folate and fibre.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>According to London-based Dr Emma Derbyshire, smoothies provide a portable, convenient source of fruit and are a useful way to top up our fruit and veg intakes.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The researchers excluded from their results those who had stopped drinking explicitly for the sake of their health, but warned that abstinence could be linked to a number of medical reasons that were included in the study.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lead author Dr Jenni Ervasti, of the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, said: ‘Some diseases, or their treatment, prevent alcohol use, which may explain the excess risks among abstainers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Moreover, participants to whom at-risk drinking causes health problems may retire early or become unemployed. Then the adverse effects are not seen in absence from work due to illness.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr James Doidge, senior research associate at University College London, also warned that the results may not be as clear-cut as they seem. He said: ‘This study showed that people who abstain from alcohol are absent more often than people who consume alcohol in moderation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The most plausible explanation for this is reverse causality: health problems cause people to drink less, and not the other way around.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The best evidence we have on the effects of alcohol consumption comes from genetic studies which, sadly, indicate that any level of alcohol consumption increases your risk of health problems.’</p><img id="i-cbb3bda542a8b689" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/01/4CF49C2B00000578-5810381-image-a-3_1528244875415.jpg" height="396" width="634" alt="Researchers were keen to stress that the findings did not definitively prove 'alcohol is good for you'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The research, published in the journal Addiction, compared women who drank one to 11 units of alcohol a week and men who reported drinking between one and 34 units.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">What are the hallmarks of a good doctor? Technical expertise and skill, of course — but someone who understands you, someone you trust, is also vital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, research shows that a good relationship with your doctor can actually improve the chances of a successful outcome. But how do you find a specialist who fits the bill?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That’s where this unique series of guides, running every day this week in the Mail, can help. We’ve identified the country’s top consultants — as judged by their peers. We’ve canvassed the views of more than 260 consultants across seven specialties from around the country and asked them this very simple, but key, question: If your own nearest and dearest were to need treatment in your field, to whom would you refer them — and why?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The consultants who earned the most votes from their peers are the ones who made it into our guides — though patients should bear in mind that this is not a scientific study.</p><img id="i-10a8091395501bf7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/01/4CF4989200000578-5810027-image-a-6_1528244220258.jpg" height="480" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, of course, there are many superb and highly skilled specialists all over the country who didn’t make it on to our list, but who spend every day of their working lives transforming patients’ lives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To help you make informed decisions about your care, we’ve also talked to experts about the latest thinking on treatment. Today, we focus on breast reconstructive surgery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">Why implants are more common</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-64505a60-6983-11e8-a9ad-a708fb59dc8a">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">HOW DO I SEE THE SPECIALIST I WANT? </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s a little known secret, but, under the NHS Constitution, patients in England have the right to choose where to receive their NHS treatment — which means you can ask to have your treatment in any hospital or clinic in the country if it has the necessary expertise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your GP can help arrange a referral to the specialist you would like to see. You (and your doctor) can access the electronic national referral service called the NHS e-Referral Service — this allows you to select your hospital or clinic as well as the date and time of your first appointment. This is not a guarantee that you will see a specific consultant — and there may be a waiting list for that specialist.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You must also consider other practical reasons for not travelling too far; if you need hospital treatment, you may not want to be hundreds of miles from family and friends.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Note that many of the specialists in our guides also work in private practice, so seeing them privately may also be an option.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just at the point when a woman can be at her most vulnerable, dealing with a breast cancer diagnosis, she is likely to be confronted by further bewildering choices on a matter to which she’s probably never given much thought: Would she like breast reconstruction?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some women may consider this a distraction; others see it as a step to aiding their self-confidence and recovery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Under National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, all breast cancer patients should be offered the full range of breast reconstruction procedures.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Broadly speaking, these fall into two main categories: implant-based reconstruction, or using the woman’s own surplus tissue, known as flaps, harvested from areas such as the abdomen, inner thigh or the back, to rebuild the breast.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Reconstruction can be carried out at the same time as the cancer surgery, or it can be delayed until all other treatment, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, is completed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although all options should be on the table for each woman, in practice it’s far less clear-cut.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most good surgeons will want to take the woman’s preferences into account, but a number of factors will influence which reconstruction option is best. The stage of cancer, the woman’s size and shape, where in the breast the lump is located and whether radiotherapy is necessary — this can scar and shrink tissues and interfere with blood supply to the breast, making reconstruction more difficult — these are all key factors in determining which type of reconstruction will produce the best cosmetic result, and whether it can be done immediately.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A woman with a smaller lump in the lower part of a medium to large, pendulous breast may be a good candidate for therapeutic mammoplasty — where the lump is removed with a cancer-free margin of tissue around it (i.e., a lumpectomy), allowing the surgeon to reshape the remaining tissue into a smaller breast.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a slim and smaller-breasted woman, breast conservation can be more of a challenge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘In a small breast, removing even a 1cm lump can leave a big defect,’ says Simon Smith, a breast surgeon at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford. ‘So then you have to think about whether you can move a bit of tissue from elsewhere to fill this, or consider whether that patient might be better with a mastectomy, then an implant reconstruction.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, 70 per cent of patients electing to have breast reconstruction end up with an implant. It is probably the simplest, most straightforward route and ‘it can get a lovely result’, according to Stephen McCulley, a breast surgeon at Nottingham City Hospital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, it is unlikely to age as well as a flap reconstruction, and if radiotherapy is needed, this may shrink the skin and harden the implant, in which case further surgery may be needed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With own-tissue breast reconstruction, the DIEP flap — where tissue and its blood supply is taken from the abdomen — is the gold-standard treatment. It is ideal for women with surplus fat around the abdomen, providing a soft, natural-feeling breast without any muscle-loss.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The key benefits of such microsurgical procedures — and only plastic surgeons are able to undertake these — is that they can provide a natural-looking and feeling breast which will gain and lose weight with the woman.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there are drawbacks — these are lengthy, complex operations and if some muscle has to be taken to boost blood supply in the breast, it can weaken areas where the tissue was mined.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Breast surgeons are the first port of call in the referral process. They diagnose suspicious lumps, carry out all necessary cancer surgery and also orchestrate chemotherapy and radiotherapy when it’s needed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Breast reconstruction is done by breast surgeons and plastic surgeons, sometimes called oncoplastic breast surgeons.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-b39eaf60-690e-11e8-a048-b7bd339fadd4">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">A tummy tuck can help with rebuilding your breast </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The aim of reconstruction is to restore a natural symmetry to a woman’s figure,’ says Steven Thrush, a breast surgeon at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘So if she’s having a mastectomy and has a generous breast, we might reconstruct a smaller breast and do a reduction on the other side.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, we look out the main available options.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>RECONSTRUCTION</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Partial: This can be an option when the cancer is on the outside of the breast and clearing it involves removing more than 15–20 per cent of the breast, but leaving more than 50 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tissue from elsewhere, such as the fatty pads in the armpits, is used to ‘fill in’ the missing parts — this is known as LICAP flap breast reconstruction.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">PROS: The healing process is quicker, though surgeons are limited by how much tissue is available, says Mr Thrush.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">CONS: There’s a risk that breast tissue that’s left behind contains cancer cells. And as more breast tissue is left with this technique, the risk may be increased, so patients tend to have radiotherapy afterwards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">FULL: This involves removing as much breast tissue as possible — the skin is retained, but the nipple may be removed if the cancer is close.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">THE DIEP FLAP: Here, fat, skin and blood vessels are lifted off the wall of the lower belly and are rejoined near the chest to rebuild the breast. This technique involves an automatic tummy tuck.</p><img id="i-2f9610a52b497b7c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/01/4CF497A100000578-5810027-image-a-3_1528244154590.jpg" height="537" width="586" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">PROS: ‘As this procedure uses fat from the patient’s body, the reconstruction feels and moves like breast tissue,’ says Mr Thrush. ‘It’s warm, changes in shape and ages with the woman’s body.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘If you lose or put on weight, the flap does, too. This is considered the gold standard in breast reconstruction.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">CONS: It’s not suitable if you have a flat tummy. Also, the operation lasts six or seven hours, patients need to be in hospital for six days and it can take three months to recover fully, says Mr Thrush, and some women may not want a long recovery time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Due to its complexity, only some hospitals offer the procedure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The biggest problem is that, because it’s such complex surgery, it doesn’t always work — one in 40 fails,’ adds Mr Thrush. ‘This is devastating for the patient, who’s gone through all that surgery for nothing.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">THE LATISSIMUS DORSI FLAP: The latissimus dorsi is a muscle in the back, just below the shoulder and behind the armpit. We need it for twisting movements, such as opening a door.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, the muscle, along with skin and fat, is moved to the chest to build a new breast. It remains attached to the arm for its blood supply.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">PROS: Unlike the DIEP flap, the blood vessels don’t have to be rejoined, so it’s less complex surgery, explains Mr Thrush.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The operation takes three to four hours, patients stay in a hospital for a few days and recovery time is usually six weeks, quicker than with the DIEP.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">CONS: There’s less fat on the back to create the breast, which can affect the shape. And as the new breast is made with muscle, it can behave like one. ‘So doing movements that affect the muscle can cause the breast to twitch,’ says Mr Thrush.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also, that side of the body might not be as strong as before.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>BREAST IMPLANTS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Implant surgery involves using a silicone gel or a saline-filled silicone shell.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">PROS: It causes very little scarring and is a much simpler operation than flap options.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The implants are anatomically shaped [they mimic breast shape] or are round,’ says Ruth Waters, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and BMI The Priory Hospital in Birmingham.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most surgeons usually use textured implants, which allow tissue to ‘stick’ to them, so they’re less likely to move or rotate. Smooth implants, which move freely inside the breast capsule, may create a rippling effect.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">CONS: The breasts can feel colder or less mobile.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The body can form hardened tissue around the implant [capsular contracture], which makes the breast uncomfortable and distorts its shape,’ says Ms Waters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Implants need to be replaced after ten to 20 years. They can change in size and sometimes rupture without symptoms, so surgeons should recommend regular MRIs.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Oncoplastics is effectively a hybrid of oncology (cancer care) and some types of plastic surgery; oncoplastic breast surgeons are experts in clearing cancer and can undertake implant reconstructions and breast conservation surgery, with the aim of creating the sort of cosmetic result the patient can live with.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, it’s worth noting that the term ‘oncoplastic’ commonly tagged on to the title ‘breast surgeon’ does not necessarily signify any further qualification — many breast surgeons who have adopted the term have had no formal training in oncoplastics, although the majority may well have done courses or visited hospitals to learn from experienced surgeons and have become very good in the process.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Plastic and reconstructive surgeons are qualified to carry out the most complex microsurgical breast reconstructions, but not to remove the cancer, for example with a lumpectomy or mastectomy (although some now do extensive further training for this, too).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In large breast units, oncoplastic breast surgeons work with the plastic surgeons as a team; breast surgeons in smaller hospitals, which are unlikely to have an on-site plastic surgeon, may well refer patients suitable for flap reconstructions to larger regional units providing such services.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘This in itself is a quality indicator, the sign of a hospital wanting to provide the full spectrum of reconstructions for their patients,’ says Mr McCulley.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what are the hallmarks of the best breast and plastic surgeons? ‘Cancer clearance is absolutely the number-one priority,’ says Jo Skillman, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at University Hospital in Coventry.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It has to be safe — but it is a fine balance. We have to take enough tissue, but not overdo it. If we don’t take enough, we can compromise cancer clearance. If we take too much, we compromise the aesthetic result.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To identify the country’s very best consultants in breast reconstruction, we canvassed the views of around 40 breast and plastic surgeons themselves.

Matching the two can be technically difficult for even the most experienced surgeons and some patients are left with a lack of ‘fullness’, or dents or hollows emerge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A newish technique known as lipomodelling can rectify this. It involves harvesting fat from the woman’s stomach or thighs, which is then used to reshape any irregularities in the reconstructed breast.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s a straightforward procedure that most reconstructive surgeons can do — it’s usually performed by the original surgeon. ‘The fat is removed under general anaesthetic using liposuction [i.e. a needle],’ explains Steven Thrush, a breast surgeon at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘A rough estimate will have been made of how much is needed and slightly more will be taken.

While some women won’t want it, there are concerns that the rate of immediate reconstruction is lower than it should be. Sometimes this may be down to cost — this type of surgery can cost up to £20,000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Ruth Waters, a consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon who specialises in breast surgery at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, every woman diagnosed with breast cancer should be offered all the options. ‘Obviously some types of reconstructive surgery are better for certain patients. But every patient should at least have the chance to be offered what is now available.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Reconstruction may be delayed until all other treatment, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, is completed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">IF YOU’RE HAVING CHEMOTHERAPY . . .</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many breast units around the country offer patients chemotherapy or hormones prior to surgery to shrink the tumour. Depending on the aggressiveness of the cancer, ‘this can be very successful,’ says Geraldine Mitchell, a breast surgeon at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Between 33 and 46 per cent of patients will respond to this to the extent that under the microscope we can no longer spot any cancer cells.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘That doesn’t mean there will be no surgery — because there could be tiny satellite cancer cells remaining — but it does mean we can save those patients from a disfiguring operation or mastectomy.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This may mean the patient may need a less extensive reconstruction operation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The order of chemotherapy and surgery very much depends on the type of breast cancer being treated,’ explains Lester Barr, a breast cancer surgeon at the Genesis Breast Cancer Prevention Centre at Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘So for example with HER2-positive breast cancer [which tests positive for a protein that promotes the growth of cancer] we like to give chemotherapy first, as it shrinks the tumour and makes the surgery easier.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘And also the chemotherapy is the priority — we have drugs such as Herceptin which work effectively in treating this cancer because they specifically target the HER2 molecule.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘So we like to get the chemotherapy in early.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With triple negative breast cancer, chemotherapy is also suggested before any surgery, he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But with women with certain types of oestrogen receptor positive breast cancers, it’s more usual to wait until after the surgery to decide if chemotherapy is needed, explains Dr Sacha Howell, a consultant in medical oncology at the Christie and Wythenshawe Hospitals in Manchester.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It’s important to look at the biology of the tumour. If it’s a small tumour, less than 2 cm in size, chemotherapy may not be needed unless it is an especially aggressive cancer or if it has spread to the lymph nodes.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If chemotherapy does take place first, it can take up to a couple of months after treatment has finished for a woman to be well enough to go ahead with surgery, adds Mr Barr.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘By then haemoglobin levels — needed for red blood cells — will have recovered and white cells, needed to fight infection, are functioning well.’ Of course, the order of treatment is ultimately the patient’s decision — some will want to have reconstruction first to get all their surgery ‘out of the way’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It’s important to remember that if you do a simultaneous immediate reconstruction as part of a mastectomy operation there’s a chance chemotherapy will be delayed because you are making a recovery from quite a big operation,’ says Mr Barr.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It’s one of the reasons, if chemotherapy is strongly advised, to have it first.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the chemotherapy is to be given after the surgery, the timing depends on the procedure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Recovery of about four weeks is needed after a mastectomy before chemotherapy can begin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The same is true if the operation also includes implant surgery. For more extensive reconstructive surgery using the patient’s own tissue, recovery before chemotherapy can take between four to ten weeks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">IF YOU’RE HAVING RADIOTHERAPY . . .</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If radiotherapy is needed, different factors have to be taken into account for reconstructive surgery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The treatment can mean the surrounding tissue on the breast won’t heal well, says Dr Howell. ‘If you have had radiotherapy prior to reconstruction, it limits the wound healing ability.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Reconstruction is possible before radiotherapy, but the treatment may spoil the cosmetic outcome, as radiotherapy can change the shape or size of the reconstructed breast, explains Mr Barr. (See reconstruction options, on the previous page.)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The job of the team is to calculate the risk of local recurrence and long-term survival when deciding treatment options,’ adds Dr Howell.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘This should be discussed very early after diagnosis.

A 2015 study conducted by the University of Michigan Medical School found that women who slept longer had more sexual desire the following day. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For every hour longer the women slept, the odds of having sex with their partner increased by 14 percent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The same study found that more sleep also equated to better genital arousal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There's so many women who say they're struggling with low sexual desire,' said Dr Mintz, who has written <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://drlauriemintz.com/books/a-tired-womans-guide-to-passionate-sex/">A Tired Woman's Guide to Passionate Sex</a> and <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://drlauriemintz.com/books/becoming-cliterate/">Becoming Cliterate</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Women are balancing different demands whether it's work or children. They feel tired and stressed out.'  </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Mintz says there are two things that can be done to improve a woman's sexual desire.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'First, sex doesn't have to happen during the night when you're tired. Find a different time of day,' she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The second is what the sex therapist calls the 'just do it approach'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Mintz says that research has shown that a majority of women in long-term relationships stop feeling spontaneously horny.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They don't realize that diminished sexual desire is to be expected and end up feeling something is wrong with them, </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We think we first need to feel horny, then have sex. But it doesn't have to follow that basic format,' she explained. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Reverse the equation because, once you do have sex, you'll feel aroused and all those hormones will be released and you'll feel good once you're in the moment.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>HOW BETTER SLEEP IMPROVES SEX FOR MEN  </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lack of shut-eye translates to lack of sex drive in both genders because it raises levels of cortisol, also known as the stress hormone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While this can affect women, it has a particularly powerful effect on men's libido.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Coupled with the fact that insufficient sleep also decreases levels of the sex hormone testosterone, the impact is significant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A study from the University of Chicago looked at men's sleep time and quality and found that men who slept four hours showed significantly lower T-levels than those who had slept eight hours.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The problem is that cortisol and testosterone work against each other, according to several studies. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">High testosterone levels allows men to decrease body fat, build muscle and keep a high libido.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cortisol works just the opposite and induces muscle breakdown and visceral fat gain as well as slow down <span style="font-size: 16px;">the immune system.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Not getting enough sleep could also diminish sexual functioning in men, Dr Mintz pointed out.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One study conducted at Donaustauf Hospital in Germany in 2009 found that men who suffer from sleep apnea are more likely to have erectile dysfunction and overall sexual dysfunction.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>BETTER SEX ALSO LEADS TO BETTER SLEEP </strong></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Just as better sleep can lead to better sex, the inverse is also true both immediate and in the long-term.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The reason is mainly biological. Post-orgasm, our body releases a hormone called oxytocin, also known as the 'cuddle hormone'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Oxytocin triggers sleepiness immediately because it counters the effects of cortisol.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Mintz explains that the physical contact partners experience during sex can also help improve sleep in the long-term.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When you're having physical contact, you feel reduced stress, which, in turns, helps you relax and therefore fall asleep,' she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Studies have shown that intimate touching can help lower blood pressure and heart rate, relieve pain and reaffirm bonds within relationships.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are also gender-specific benefits to how good sexual intercourse helps us sleep.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In women, sex increases the levels of the hormone estrogen. Estrogen is a sleep-maintaining hormone and high levels of it have been shown to improve the quality of sleep, reduce time to fall asleep, and increase the amount of REM sleep. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The effect for women is long-term. There is a natural decrease of estrogen levels after women enter menopause, which is why post-menopausal women are more likely to suffer from insomnia.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For men, among the many hormones they release during ejaculation,  one is a biochemical known as prolactin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prolactin levels are naturally higher during sleep, and research has shown that  animals injected with the chemical become tired immediately.    </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>There are plenty of reasons to get a good night's sleep.  Snoozing for at least eight hours can help improve memory, curb inflammation and sharpen your attention.

Mrs Horsley claims on one occasion her mother scalded herself because staff gave her hot tea in a cup instead of a beaker. They say she was left to sleep in tea-stained pyjamas that caused ‘blisters the size of oranges’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mrs Horsley also claims it took three weeks for staff to notice her mother had broken her arm, and she never found out how that injury occurred. ‘People don’t know how bad the quality of care really was and I think they should,’ she said. ‘Even now, I go to bed and I think about it.

For example, if you are busy focusing on a task you may be less likely to be tempted by food smells. Or if you don’t want your friend to guess you are baking them a birthday cake in the other room, you could distract them with a puzzle for about 20 minutes.’<strong> </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The study paves the way to test how busy people react to ‘threat smells’ like smoke and gas.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How they carried out the study </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The researchers asked participants to carry out a demanding task where they were asked to search for an object in a room that smelled strongly of coffee.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After leaving the room participants were asked to describe the room, and then asked follow up questions to determine whether or not they had noticed the smell.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those participants whose attention was occupied by the task were 42.5 per cent less likely to notice the smell. The participants were typically really surprised when they returned to the room afterwards to discover the strong coffee smell, which they had previously missed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The second finding - that people may never notice a smell if they have habituated to it - was tested in a follow up experiment in which participants were asked what they could smell while they were still sitting in the room which smelt of coffee. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The majority (65 per cent) couldn’t detect the coffee because they had habituated while they were doing the task.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In vision, the task is known as the ‘perceptual load hypothesis’ - the idea that people can only perceive sensory information until their capacity is full.</p><img id="i-3423bd8fc022552d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/16/4CF11CC800000578-0-image-a-21_1528214159080.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The study represents the first time that the condition ‘inattentional anosmia’, has been proven" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-d4434de0-68da-11e8-83ed-7106447a48d5">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">COULD YOUR SENSE OF SMELL TELL YOU WHAT WAY YOU WILL VOTE?</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">A person's sense of smell can predict how they will vote in political elections, a study suggested in February.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Researchers at Stockholm University in Sweden found that the way people react to body odor in particular is a psychological indicator of their political preferences.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Participants were given a survey that paired questions about smell with questions about which candidates they planned to vote for in 2016.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The results revealed that people who were more disgusted by certain odors such as urine and sweat were also more likely to vote for Donald Trump than those who were less sensitive.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">It explains the well-known ‘Did you see the gorilla?’ inattentional blindness study, where observers are asked to focus on the number of ball passes between players wearing white, and almost always miss the person in a gorilla suit who walks across the scene, does a little dance in the middle and walks off.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Forster said: ‘In the case of visual or auditory information, we tend to notice it once we are no longer busy. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'However, the brain can habituate to smells so strongly that they cannot be detected even when we are specifically asked about smells in the room.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘If this habituation occurs during the period that people are distracted by a task, the opportunity to detect a smell may be missed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It is thought that the reason that there is a time limit for detecting smells relates to fact that the olfactory system evolved before the other senses, and therefore is more basic and animalistic.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The research, conducted with Professor Charles Spence of Oxford University, is published in Psychological Science.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Scientists from the University of Sussex have found that you can temporarily lose your sense of smell when your attention is diverted.

A 2017 video was leaked of Jonathan Bush (left) at a healthcare industry event dressed in a race car driver outfit saying he wants to 'jump down on' one of his female employees and ‘do inappropriate things'. Last week, it was reported that Bush assaulted his ex-wife, Sarah Seldon (right), including 'repeatedly slamming his closed fist into her sternum' and once causing her a black eye. Two complaints were also filed against Bush in 2007 and in 2009 by two former female employees. The 2009 complaint stated Bush stared at her breasts and made lewd comments about her. This all occurs as Bush is trying to prevent a takeover of his company by Elliott Management, a New York hedge fund. The firm, run by billionaire Paul Singer, offered to buy Athenahealth in a $7billion all-cash deal in May.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Mary Kekatos</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-05T22:37:54.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Athenahealth CEO faces new allegations of inappropriate behavior</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-05T22:37:54.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5805261/Victims-recount-sex-abuse-Canadas-ex-national-ski-coach.html" title="'My childhood was STOLEN': Four ski stars abused by Canada's former national coach 20 years ago speak out about the trauma they experienced one year after his conviction"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5803403/Bill-Clinton-insists-doesnt-owe-Monica-Lewinsky-apology-HES-victim-too.html" title="Sorry for what?

<p class="mol-para-with-font">What are the hallmarks of a good doctor? Skill and technical expertise, of course. But also vital is someone who understands you and someone you trust.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, research has proved that a good relationship with a doctor can actually improve your chances of a successful outcome. But how do you find a specialist who fits the bill?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That’s where this unique series of guides, which started in Saturday’s Mail and continues every day this week, can help you out.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We have identified the country’s top consultants — as judged by their peers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’ve canvassed the views of more than 260 of them, across seven specialities, and asked them this very simple, but key, question: ‘If your own nearest and dearest were to need treatment in your field, to whom would you refer them — and why?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The consultants who earned the most votes from their peers are the ones who made it into our guides.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Patients should bear in mind, though, that this is not a scientific study and there are many superb, highly skilled professionals nationwide who didn’t make it on to our list, but who are making a real difference to patients every day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To help you make informed choices about your own care, or that of your loved ones, we’ve also talked to experts about the very latest thinking on various treatment options.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, we look at the best doctors for heart rhythm problems.  </p><img id="i-30d542db9cda2bf5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/17/4CF1488300000578-0-image-a-9_1528216144166.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The good doctors guide: Meet the best heart rhythm surgeons in Britain and learn the cutting-edge treatments used to correct flutters" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">More than two million people in the UK have a faulty heartbeat, or arrhythmia. Unfortunately, up to half-a-million go undiagnosed and, as their condition hasn’t been spotted and, therefore, treated, their risk of stroke is significantly raised.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The good news for those who have been diagnosed is that there’s been a revolution in the treatment of heart rhythm disorders in recent years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These disorders occur when the heart’s electrical circuits, responsible for keeping it pumping, become scrambled, sending faulty messages that override the heart’s natural pacemaker, a cluster of cells known as the sinus node. This problem can be something you were born with or a consequence of coronary heart disease or ageing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Arrhythmias can range from a slow heartbeat, where the organ can’t pump enough blood around the body, to the most dangerous form, ventricular fibrillation —the latter can be fatal without rapid emergency treatment.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Symptoms range from the mild to the alarming. Your heart may seem to flutter or skip beats. Or it can race like mad, even though you’re just quietly watching TV. Or you might find yourself suddenly exhausted, short of breath and prone to fainting.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The most common arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation, which causes a fast, chaotic heartbeat. This tends to occur mostly in people over the age of 60 and affects around a million Britons.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, random electrical charges cause the upper chambers of the heart (called the atria) to quiver, affecting the heart’s ability to pump blood efficiently.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The most serious consequence of untreated atrial fibrillation is stroke, because the heart’s feeble pumping action allows blood to pool, causing clots, which can break off and travel to the brain. This is why one of the first steps in treating the condition is blood-thinning medication.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whatever the type of arrhythmia, medication can be used to try to control or prevent it.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-7cb7c6c0-68dd-11e8-bf92-f723a1384c47">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">WHAT IS ARRHYTHMIA? </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">More than two million people in the UK have a faulty heartbeat, or arrhythmia.

This non-surgical procedure is becoming the gold standard way to resolve problems with heart rhythm, particularly atrial fibrillation, says Philippa Hobson, a senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is performed by an expert cardiologist, known as an electrophysiologist, and takes between two and four hours. A thin wire with an electrode at its tip is threaded through the veins — usually starting in the thigh — to the heart to create scar tissue, either with heat or freezing, to destroy rogue tissue responsible for sending faulty signals, or effectively block abnormal electrical circuits in the heart.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, as one leading cardiologist told us, it would be a dreadful shame ‘if the technological demands eclipsed the human side’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Edward Rowland, who is based at St Bartholomew’s Hospital in London, says that empathy and a caring attitude are important, too — particularly when patients are worried.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Successfully treating patients, he suggests, is not just about the ablation operation, but how the patient is treated in the run-up to it and their aftercare.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘When your heart starts going crazy and you think you are going to die, it is not surprising that patients can become very anxious,’ says Dr Rowland.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Technical expertise is very important — but this has to be accompanied by other human factors to produce the best results possible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There are some cardiologists who are excellent technically, but you would not necessarily send your closest family to them.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, how do you find an electrophysiologist equipped with not just the technological nous, but also the bedside manner that can help people conquer a distressing, and sometimes disabling, disease?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We asked 40 consultants across the country who they believe are the top performers.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">What are the hallmarks of a good doctor? Technical expertise and skill, of course — but someone who understands you, someone you trust, is also vital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, research shows that a good relationship with your doctor can actually improve the chances of a successful outcome.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But how do you find a specialist who fits the bill? That’s where this unique series of guides, running every day this week in the Mail, can help.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’ve identified the country’s top consultants — as judged by their peers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’ve canvassed the views of more than 260 consultants across seven specialties from around the country, and asked them this very simple but key question: ‘If your own nearest and dearest were to need treatment in your field, to whom would you refer them — and why.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The consultants who earned the most votes from their own peers are the ones who made it into our guides. Though patients should bear in mind that this is not a scientific study and there are many superb and highly skilled specialists all over the country who didn’t make it onto our list but who spend every day of their working lives making a real difference to patients.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To help you make informed decisions about your care, we’ve also talked to experts about the latest thinking on treatment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, we look at the best prostate cancer surgeons.</p><img id="i-1f52e7591cdbdf06" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/17/4CF14EDB00000578-0-image-a-1_1528216917176.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The good doctors guide: Meet the best urologists in Britain and learn the pioneering treatments used in the battle against prostate cancer" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ask most people how prostate cancer is treated and the chances are they’ll say ‘surgery’. In fact, surgery — removal of the prostate — is just one weapon in the arsenal of procedures.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone treatment have as big a part to play for many patients and, increasingly, urologists advocate ‘active surveillance’, where patients are regularly monitored to keep tabs on the tumour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This means they can avoid unnecessary treatment, but it gives them the option to decide on surgery in the event the tumour changes. Active surveillance is earmarked for patients with low-risk cancer which hasn’t spread beyond the prostate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘In the past, we’ve tended to couple cancer diagnosis with treatment,’ says Anthony Koupparis, a urological surgeon at Southmead Hospital in Bristol.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘What we are now doing is disconnecting that process so, at the point of diagnosis, we put the brakes on and have a discussion with the patient and explain the type of cancer they have. If it’s not life threatening, I will tell the patient they genuinely don’t need an operation.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Every now and then I will get a man who, despite the very early low-grade nature of their cancer, cannot deal with the thought of living with it,’ adds Mr Koupparis. ‘I will give him lots to read on the subject and if he returns and says he can’t deal with living with an untreated tumour, then I will definitely operate, if that’s what he wants.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avoiding needless treatment is driven by the fact that surgery to remove the prostate (radical prostatectomy) and radio-therapy can leave men incontinent and impotent as a result of damage to muscles and nerves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Around 15 per cent of prostate cancer patients have surgery. Up to a quarter will suffer temporary urinary leakage afterwards, although only two out of 100 men have major problems with urinary incontinence one year after surgery, according to Cancer Research UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Erectile dysfunction can also be a problem. It is ‘realistic’ to expect some problems with erectile dysfunction after surgery, according to Jane Brocksom, a senior nurse specialist in urology and Vice President of the British Association of Urological Nurses. But ‘most men will have only mild issues’ and sexual function can return.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, it’s important to note that many men may have had such problems before diagnosis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘A lot of prostate patients say that their waterworks and erections are fine, but when we check the questionnaires we ask them to complete, you can see those functions aren’t normal,’ says Mr Koupparis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The risk can be reduced with a technique known as nerve-sparing prostatectomy (which may be possible when the cancer is low grade and hasn’t spread beyond the prostate).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Around six out of ten men will be able immediately to have an erection if the surgeon is able to spare the nerves during surgery, says Cancer Research UK. The technique involves protecting the nerves by peeling them away before removing the prostate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The prostate is removed with a small rim of surrounding tissue and sent to a pathology lab where it is examined under a microscope to see how close to the margins of the gland the cancer has spread.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Surgeons want a cancer-free margin of tissue around the prostate to be certain no cancer cells have been left behind.</p><mol-permabox id="mol-ba77cfd0-68df-11e8-bf70-93c99a3e706e"></mol-permabox><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, labs take three days to process the result, so in borderline cases — men with larger and more aggressive tumours which might pose a threat to the nerves — the surgeon makes a judgment based on what he can see and scans and tests carried out beforehand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Does he take a belt and braces approach, and sacrifice the nerves to be sure the cancer is controlled? Or should he spare them to optimise potency?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A new form of nerve-sparing surgery shows promise in helping men preserve their erections without compromising their long-term health.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">NeuroSAFE speeds up the pathology process so that conclusive results are given to the surgeon while the patient is still on the operating table. A study at the NHS Lister Hospital in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, where NeuroSAFE is now routinely offered to all patients who stand to benefit, 74 per cent of men who were able to have erections before surgery were still able to a year after, compared with 45 per cent of men not assessed with it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the real seismic shift in prostate cancer treatment has been the arrival of the Da Vinci robot — where a surgeon remotely controls three or four robotic arms over the patient lying a few feet away. Robot-assisted prostatectomies now constitute 80 per cent of all prostate removal procedures in the UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The £1.5 million cost of a robot has led to prostate cancer treatment shifting to major centres in cities such as London, Bristol, Newcastle and Canterbury. This in turn has reduced complication rates and improved outcomes for patients, because the number of prostatectomies each surgeon performs has soared.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As Declan Cahill, a urological surgeon at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, explains: ‘The link between high volume [large number of operations performed per year] and good outcomes is undisputed.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Professor Chris Eden, a urological surgeon at the Royal Surrey County Hospital, says he wouldn’t ‘send my own relative to anyone doing fewer than 100 prostatectomies a year — that’s what you need to maintain consistently good results. That may seem unfair to urologists doing fewer, but surgeons have no God-given right to do an operation.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can check how many prostatectomies each surgeon carries out on the British Association of Urological Surgeons website (baus.org.uk — search under Patients).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Surgeons are also required to submit some of their results on the website. Good urologists will record not just their mortality and complication data but also the ‘functional outcomes’ — in other words, results for continence and erectile function.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In any event, prospective patients should certainly ask a urologist about their results — and be cautious about anyone who is less than forthcoming.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what are the other hallmarks of a good urologist? We set out to identify not just those consultants who get consistently good results but those judged to be outstanding by their peers. We canvassed the views of around 40 urologists from around the country on who are the top performers — here we reveal their choices, with a selection of the personal comments about why they chose them.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-55d34e20-68de-11e8-bf70-93c99a3e706e">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Prostate cancer surgeons and their peers rate the best in their field</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><img id="i-ccfaafd1c38532aa" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/18/050C7A5D000007D0-5808997-image-a-18_1528219315069.jpg" height="284" width="284" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>DECLAN CAHILL</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Royal Marsden Hospital in London</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT HIM:</strong> ‘An incredibly talented young surgeon and one of the highest volume surgeons for prostatectomy in the country [ie, he performs a large number of operations],’ says one urologist. ‘I’ve seen him operate and he is outstanding.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He pays great attention to detail and is passionate about getting good outcomes and striving to do better — he’s extremely self-critical and analyses his results, which is the only way of assessing your performance to see how you can improve it.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Declan is very approachable and caring and patients love him,’ says another. ‘He is open to discussing anything with his patients: his aim is not just to do the surgery but to look after the whole person.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">PRIVATE PRACTICE: The Royal Marsden Hospital (private care), London Bridge Hospital, The Princess Grace Hospital, Parkside Hospital, both in London.</p><img id="i-6a313598255244ff" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/18/050C7B3D000007D0-5808997-image-a-20_1528219324135.jpg" height="362" width="284" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>PROFESSOR CHRIS EDEN</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT HIM</strong>: ‘He was the leading keyhole surgeon with prostatectomies — his cancer margins were one of the lowest in the country [in other words, no cancer cells were found at the edge of the removed prostate] — and has since switched to the robot,’ says one urologist.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He’s excellent, immensely skilled, very tidy and does a large number [high volume] of prostatectomies,’ says another.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He has pioneered retzius-sparing prostatectomy in this country —where the prostate is approached from beneath the bladder rather than above, which shows promise in providing early return of continence, although other surgeons are sceptical about the technique.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">PRIVATE PRACTICE: BMI The Hampshire Clinic in Basingstoke, BMI Mount Alvernia Hospital in Guildford, London Bridge Hospital, Nuffield Health Guildford Hospital.</p><img id="i-5e8c062117d8b288" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/18/055F82E6000007D0-5808997-image-a-12_1528219229792.jpg" height="213" width="284" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>JIM ADSHEAD</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lister Hospital in Stevenage</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT HIM</strong>: ‘A very high quality surgeon.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Only between two and five percent of people manage to keep weight off after a diet. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A major reason for this is that diets don't help us deal with the underlying emotional, psychological and habitual triggers for overeating.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most of us can stick with a diet for a few weeks, or to get into that dress or pair of skinny jeans for an important event – but after that, research shows that we not only gain the weight back, but pile on more.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Calorie restricting diets can feel like punishment, so as soon as the goal weight is achieved, we slip back into old habits. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Without really figuring out why we overeat, it's impossible to make changes to eating habits that will last.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, psychologist and well-being expert for Healthspan and author of <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Shrinkology-Solution-Dr-Meg-Arroll/">The Shrinkology Solution</a> Dr Meg Arroll reveals a quick trick to tell if you're hungry and the easy tips you need to shed the pounds – and keep them off for good.</p><img id="i-e1385bbdaeda662c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/17/4CF1641300000578-5808935-image-a-9_1528217701325.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Often we're not hungry for food but we eat because of boredom, stress or emotions" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Are you REALLY hungry?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most people don't even know what true physiological hunger is any more. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We are all born with the need to eat but over time our hunger signals can become mixed-up and no longer be a sign that we need food.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Due to constant grazing, often triggered by the 24/7 food adverts and messages that bombard us every day, many people don't know what it feels like to be hungry.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead the desire to eat comes from associations we have between food and love – for example sweet treats given to us as children to soothe a scratched knee, trip to the doctors or hurt feelings. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then later in life we feel the need for comfort, our brains trick us into thinking that a cake or ice cream is what we require.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We also commonly eat as a distraction from boredom or in response to stress. Next time you feel hungry try this quick mental exercise, The Broccoli Test. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Why do we crave foods that make us overweight?</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There's a very good reason why foods high in calories (usually fat and sugar) are so attractive to us. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In evolutionary terms, our ancestors would have sought energy dense foods out in order to survive. </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-dc6137a0-68dd-11e8-ba70-31421815ee1e">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">DO YOU NEED A SNACK?

When you start to feel hungry, do the Broccoli Test.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2. If you find you're not really hungry, but the craving is driving you mad, distract yourself by reading a paragraph of text backwards. This will occupy your mind and soon the craving will pass.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">3. If you're out and about, try wearing an elastic band on your wrist and ping this when a craving strikes – the mild pain will shock your senses and refocus your mind.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">4. Tell your family and friends that you're starting a new, healthier lifestyle. Social support is key to a lasting lifestyle change so get them on board.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">5. Stick with it, a new habit takes on average 66 days to form.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">6.

She has taken to blogging to share her experience and warns others who may be dealing with something similar to trust their gut instinct.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Mary Kekatos</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-05T18:42:10.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Woman finally diagnosed with rare spinal disease</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-05T18:42:10.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5806763/Woman-64-dies-hepatitis-outbreak-linked-national-recall-frozen-fruit.html" title="Woman, 64, dies of hepatitis A due to outbreak linked to national recall of frozen fruit"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5803633/The-world-cancer-league-tables-Scientists-calculate-best-worst-performing-countries.html" title="The world cancer league tables: Scientists calculate the countries with the best and worst performing statistics for 29 forms of the disease"></link></item><item><title>Boozing may lead to Alzheimer's: Alcohol stops the brain from clearing away toxic clumps that lead to the memory-robbing disease, reveals study</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5807317/Boozing-contribute-Alzheimers-stops-brain-clearing-away-toxic-clumps.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jun 2018 14:12:47 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5807317</guid><description><![CDATA[Boozing may contribute to Alzheimer's disease by causing inflammation in the brain and reducing its ability to repair itself, according to researchers from the University of Illinois in Chicago.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

North American triple reassortant H3N2, Eurasian avian-like H1N1, and pandemic H1N1.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the H1N1 viruses had mutated with H3N2 viruses, producing three new genotypes of flu -

  </video><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some older people may also lack folic acid. But should others be taking the pills to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Studies highlighting the potential benefits for cardiovascular disease first emerged more than 20 years ago. These suggested the vitamin pills might work by lowering levels of homocysteine in the blood, a type of amino acid that occurs naturally as a result of proteins in the diet being broken down in the body. Folic acid releases an enzyme that stops the formation of homocysteine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some studies suggest eating excessive amounts of protein — such as red meat — can increase homocysteine levels, and that this damages the walls of arteries, leading to increased risk of heart disease and stroke.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A 2014 U.S. study published in the journal Cerebrovascular Diseases found taking daily folic acid supplements could cut the risk of a heart attack by around 25 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, a review published in 2017 by the highly-respected Cochrane Library analysed findings from 15 trials involving more than 70,000 people taking blood pressure tablets and folic acid, or blood pressure tablets alone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It concluded that folic acid supplements had no additional impact on the risk of suffering or dying from a heart attack and only a minimal impact on stroke. In fact, it said, doctors would need to treat 143 people for more than five years to prevent one stroke.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Furthermore, the Chinese study on which the recommendation is based is flawed, claims Catherine Collins, a registered NHS dietitian and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, she says, researchers failed to take account of whether patients did regular exercise — if they did, this could be the reason why some had lower stroke risk, not taking folic acid.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also, the study failed to allow for how much folate there was in each person’s diet. If they ate plenty of greens, this could be why their stroke risk was lower instead of popping folic acid pills. In other words, there is little proof it was the supplements having the benefit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But one leading cardiologist believes the evidence on stroke at least is overwhelming.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">David Wald, a professor of cardiology and a consultant cardiologist at Barts Health NHS Trust, says the case for supplementing diets with folic acid is conclusive.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Professor Wald was involved in a study nearly 20 years ago which showed harmful homocysteine levels could be lowered by taking folic acid and that the minimum effective dose was 800mcg a day — four times the recommended daily allowance for an adult.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Taking too much folic acid can cause stomach cramps, diarrhoea and sleep disorders. But the Department of Health says anything up to 1 milligram (or 1,000 mcg) is perfectly safe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘At this level, there are no adverse effects but homocysteine levels are reduced,’ says Professor Wald. ‘One would have to eat approximately 4kg of broccoli to get the equivalent amount of folate, which is impractical. I take a daily supplement of 800mcg to protect myself against strokes and think most people should do the same.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Professor Wald, one reason research has failed to show any major benefit in the prevention of heart attacks is because many patients in trials were also taking aspirin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Folic acid and aspirin can both lower levels of platelets — cells involved in the clotting process — reducing the chances of a life-threatening clot blocking the blood flow to the heart.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In other words, the potential benefits of folic acid were masked by those of aspirin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘If you look at the trials where patients did not take aspirin, then folic acid did have an impact on heart attack reduction.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Treating high blood pressure and lowering cholesterol are still the most effective ways to tackle cardiovascular disease.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But increasing folic acid intake could reduce the number of strokes by an additional 10 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The UK’s failure to fortify foods with folic acid has been described by some as a public health failure. Not only would it reduce the risk of birth defects, but I believe there would also be significant benefits in stroke prevention.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other experts believe folic acid could have a major impact on dementia, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Research by David Smith, professor of pharmacology at Oxford University, suggests that giving patients with mild cognitive impairment (a very early stage of Alzheimer’s) a daily supplement with folic acid and other B vitamins slows the decline in memory, and the rate the brain shrinks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But only the patients with high homocysteine levels to begin with saw any benefit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Professor Smith believes the NHS should routinely screen older people to see if they have higher homocysteine — using a £10 blood test — and advising those who do to take folic acid tablets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It’s estimated up to 20 per cent of Alzheimer’s is caused by raised blood levels of homocysteine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We’ve published a cost-benefit analysis which showed testing and treating this way would save the country many millions of pounds each year and have I presented these findings to Public Health England and to NICE.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Neither showed any interest, even though many thousands of elderly will suffer from dementia who could well have been protected by this simple approach.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>A major new study published last week by scientists from the University of Toronto found that pills taken by millions of people in Britain — from multivitamins and vitamin D, to calcium and vitamin C — won’t reduce the risk of heart disease or help you live longer.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Three women are to become the first in Britain to have womb transplants.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They will undergo pioneering surgery within the next few months using wombs donated by a mother or sister. Doctors believe the procedure may allow thousands of women to realise their dream of motherhood.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It’s a truly exciting time,’ said Richard Smith, the consultant gynaecologist leading the project. ‘We have the opportunity to make a real difference.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It’s a major step forward for women with absolute uterine infertility. Until now their only options have been adoption or surrogacy, which is not always easy.’ It means the first British baby could be born as a result of the procedure by early 2020. The surgery will take place at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The world’s first successful womb transplant took place in Sweden in 2013. The UK has led the way in research but red tape and lack of funding have let other countries forge head.</p><img id="i-7b8a25bfbaf6e87b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/23/4CEA685D00000578-5805569-image-a-20_1528152726521.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The UK has led the field in terms of research into womb transplants but has lagged behind in the implementation of procedure" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-e7e625c6df570b6e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/23/4CE9757800000578-5805569-image-a-2_1528149767587.jpg" height="438" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The treatment, which costs around £30,000 per patient, is being funded by the charity Womb Transplant UK because it is still too experimental for the NHS.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For Mr Smith, an award-winning surgeon from Imperial College London, it is the culmination of 20 years of research by him and his unpaid team. The women are expected to be chosen within weeks from a waiting list of around 50.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All want children but were either born without a functioning womb or have had it removed due to illnesses such as cancer.</p><div>

The baby will need to be delivered by caesarean section because the transplanted uterus is likely to become detached during childbirth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once a patient’s family is complete, the womb will be removed to stop the need for anti-rejection medication.</p><video preload="none" id="3825603406001" title="Woman born without womb gives birth after transplant in 2014" poster="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/07/video-undefined-2206012400000578-677_636x359.jpg">

  </video><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eleven babies have been born worldwide as a result of 42 womb transplants, mostly in Sweden, the US and the Middle East.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2014, Malin Stenburg, then 36, became the world’s first woman to have a baby following a womb transplant from a donation from a 61-year-old family friend.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Vincent was born two months prematurely following treatment by Gothenburg University, which has higher success rates than traditional IVF.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although permission was granted in the UK in 2015 for transplants using dead donors, experts generally prefer live family donors to minimise the chances of rejection. While previous transplants have taken surgeons up to 13 hours, a technique Mr Smith helped develop while treating a patient with cervical cancer will reduce this to between three and four.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Two babies have already been born using the procedure – abdominal radical trachelectomy. Womb Transplant UK has now been given the green light by the NHS to test the technique on UK patients.</p><img id="i-56129464cee19ddc" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/23/4CEA680D00000578-5805569-image-a-21_1528152734476.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The treatment costs £30,000 a pop and is currently only available through private sources" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although many patients on its waiting list have relatives who are willing donors, the charity has only enough money for three procedures.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It hopes today’s announcement could generate the £400,000 needed for a further two live transplants – and ten more from dead donors – in the next two years. If the research is successful, doctors suggest the procedure could become available on the NHS by 2022. Mr Smith warned the whole process would be ‘far from easy’ for those selected for the life-changing procedure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the father of four added: ‘Anyone who sees the suffering these women go through – not only being unable to physically carry a child but relationships destroyed, and their heartbreaking sense of somehow being an “incomplete” – would know these are a group of women who we really do need to strive for. It is up to me and other doctors to do the best we can by them and help them to become parents.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some doctors have warned that womb transplants require more strictly controlled clinical trials before they can be used more widely. Experts from Japan reviewed the findings so far and said while the technique offered ‘great hope’ for women, little was known about factors which can affect its success.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They say a more targeted approach is needed to see whether factors such as the age of donors and recipients and other health conditions are important.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Writing in the international Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, they said complications have included urinary tract problems, thrombosis, infection and haematoma in those receiving the transplant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Immuno-suppressants, which are used to reduce risk of rejection of a transplanted womb, may also play a role in the development of pre-eclampsia, and high-risk pregnancy monitoring is necessary, said the authors. Measures for the management of treatment-resistant rejection of the womb during pregnancy were required and this remained a major task, they add.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Japanese scientists said there had been only ‘limited success’ since the first womb transplant in 2013.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">It's taken 20 years.

At last they will be able to carry their own baby. We literally can’t wait.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Around 50 women aged between 24 and 38 are on our waiting list, some of whom have been on it for over five years. All of them are in a long-term relationship, all of them yearn to have a baby. They find themselves in this heartbreaking situation for a variety of reasons: some were born without a womb, some had their womb removed because of cancer; others have a womb that does not ‘work’ – possibly lacking the lining needed for an embryo to embed into it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From that list we will select three women for surgery because that is all we have the money for right now – each operation costs £30,000. We will start using live donors – either the woman’s mother or sister – but from the autumn it will be possible for us to do transplants from dead donors too. By joining the national donor register we will be alerted if a womb becomes available.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At last we are at a point that I wondered if we would ever reach. I have been involved in this project for 20 years, during which time we have experienced many setbacks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what has kept me going are the times when I have found myself sitting opposite women who, for whatever reason, need a womb transplant. It is so humbling to hear what they’ve been through. As a father of four, I could not and would not want to imagine life without children.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Anyone who sees the suffering these women go through – being unable to carry a child, relationships destroyed, a heartbreaking sense of somehow being ‘incomplete’ – would know they really deserve this chance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It will be far from easy for those selected – they face multiple and sometimes arduous operations. There is the transplant itself, followed by the implantation of the embryos they’ve conceived with IVF, then a caesarean birth (a vaginal delivery would put too much strain on the uterus that has been stitched into place). And when their family is complete they will need to have the womb removed, to avoid a lifetime on immune suppressing drugs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I hope that when they are able to feel their baby’s kick and experience the thrill of pregnancy it will all be worthwhile.</p><img id="i-ec00e6095f569972" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/23/4CEA681F00000578-5805569-image-a-22_1528152752117.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="It is hoped the new procedure could be refined to the stage where it is available on the NHS by 2020" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the main reasons it has taken us so long to get to this point has been financial – the NHS has not funded the 20 years of research nor will it fund the operations themselves. It does not normally back work on ‘blue sky’ surgical techniques.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead the money has come via the charity Womb Transplant UK from fundraising – volunteers running marathons, baking cakes and hosting dinners.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">None of the team – including five senior gynaecological surgeons, two transplant surgeons and three junior surgeons – and at least ten others including infertility and obstetrics specialists, pathologists and psychologists – has been paid. We’ve also had to go through layers and layers of regulation and consult with interested parties such as the British Transplant Society and NHS England.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We had intended using only brain-dead donors but this has been limiting, because we have to ensure that we did not disrupt the national organ programme.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Everyone knows there is a shortage of organs for life-saving operations, and a womb will not save lives (though that is not to say that this is not vital, life-changing surgery).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other countries have largely avoided this issue by sticking to using mainly live donors. We too are now moving toward using live donors – and the reason we are able to move ahead confidently is we now have a way of retrieving the womb that dramatically reduces the time involved and the risk to the donor.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Surgeons working with live donors in Sweden, which led to their first live birth in 2014, were using the ileac artery and vein, the blood vessels that take blood to and from the main organs in the pelvis, to carry blood to and from the transplanted womb.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But removing the ileac vein from the live donor is difficult because it runs very close to the ureter, which takes urine from the kidney and the risk of damage is high. The surgery itself is also long and complex. To extract the womb and blood vessels takes up to 13 hours, and the risk of blood clots forming starts to increase after around seven hours of surgery to over 1 per cent. In our view the risk was too high for a woman donating her womb and not benefiting in anyway.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My eureka moment came last September when I heard Liza Johannesson, a gynaecological surgeon from the Baylor University Medical Centre in Dallas, give a talk about a new simpler technique to plumb in the new womb from a live donor that resulted in two live births.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I realised what she was talking about was essentially radical abdominal trachelectomy – a technique that I had invented with two other colleagues some years ago, as a way to operate on a patient with cervical cancer!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It involves plumbing in the new womb using the ileac artery to take blood into the uterus and then the ovarian vein to take blood away. The ovarian blood vessel is much easier to reach so the retrieval time drops from at least eight hours to just three or four. I was so excited by the possibilities that this opened up that after she had finished talking I ran after Dr Johannesson and said: ‘Can I just check I have this right?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I couldn’t believe I hadn’t thought of using this method myself – not least because I had first thought womb transplants might be possible many years ago when doing cervical cancer surgery. For this you sometimes have to remove the patient’s womb, still attached to two blood vessels, and stitch it back into place once the cancer is cleared.</p><img id="i-cdd367d22af05576" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/23/4CEA689C00000578-5805569-image-a-23_1528152759221.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Doctors say there has been limited progress since the world's first womb transplant was carried out in Sweden in 2013" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">With this new approach now a possibility, I started to put the wheels in motion. Using a related live donor is a major advantage because there is less risk of the woman’s body rejecting the donated womb.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We already had women who had contacted us with a mother or sister willing to donate their womb, so all we had to do was ensure they were a good match.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is exciting to be at this stage but we still need to be cautious and careful about selecting the right women.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They should be in a stable relationship; they must have their own ovaries and eggs, be aged 24 to 38 (or 40 if their eggs were frozen before 38) and have no significant health problems such as diabetes or a high Body Mass Index.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those on our list have been interviewed by myself and others to check on this. They then go for formal psychological assessment because it’s vital to ensure these women (and their partners) are in a suitable mental state.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The live donor needs to be seen by a psychologist as well. And obviously there are blood tests to ensure the living donor is a good match.

Hot flushes be controlled with a new device that's currently being trialled " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Around 50 women are now taking part in a clinical trial of the device in the U.S.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hot flushes are a common symptom of the menopause. A rise in skin temperature in the face and upper body causes blood vessels just under the skin to dilate, leading to the characteristic ‘flushed’ look, as well as a feeling of intense heat and sweating.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While the exact cause of this is not known, one theory is that it involves a malfunction of the heat control mechanisms in the brain, possibly as a result of the changes in hormone levels that occur around the menopause.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The autonomic, or involuntary, nervous system, which regulates unconscious bodily functions such as heartbeat, is also involved in hot flushes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new device, which is known as HIRREM (high-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring), works by detecting changes in the brain’s activity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has three components: scalp sensors, a small computer and headphones. First, sensors on the scalp monitor electrical activity in the brain. These signals are sent to a small computer, which is programmed to translate them into sounds. This series of sounds is then sent through wires to headphones worn by the patient — the whole process takes less than eight milliseconds.</p><img id="i-881d994dd1cfa2e2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/23/4CEA6AF800000578-5805167-image-a-10_1528152973505.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Common: Hot flushes are a common symptom of menopause and affects millions of women" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The theory is that hearing the sounds alerts the brain to any malfunction in the autonomic nervous system, which it then corrects. For example, if the tones are too erratic, it will reset the signals to make the pattern more regular and balanced.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This technique is also being investigated for post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia and high blood pressure — all thought to be linked to irregular signals in the autonomic nervous system.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Research last year at Wake Forest University in the U.S., where the new hot flushes trial is being held, showed that the brain recognises the tones as reflecting its own electrical activity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a pilot study of 12 menopausal women given the treatment, researchers found it led to significant reductions in the frequency and severity of hot flushes, as well as reduced symptoms of insomnia and depression, reported the journal Menopause in 2015.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the new study, 48 women will be given 20 sessions over three months, each roughly 90 minutes long, or continue with standard care, such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Symptoms will then be compared.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Commenting on the research, Haitham Hamoda, a consultant gynaecologist at King’s College Hospital in London, said: ‘This explores the theory that reflecting electrical activity in the brain may help reset the autonomic nervous system response to hot flushes and provide symptomatic relief for these.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Other studies along similar lines have shown a beneficial effect with cognitive behavioural therapy in managing hot flushes and, therefore, there is merit in further exploring this concept.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The results from the study are awaited with interest.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Special headphones that allow patients to ‘listen’ to their brainwaves could be a new way to tackle hot flushes.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">A scar is testimony to the incredible power of our bodies to heal. As soon as a wound occurs, our skin tries to close it as quickly as possible, to prevent infection.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The body gets to work rebuilding tissue by sending out fibroblasts, cells that make collagen, which is the support structure of the skin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, in this race to repair itself and replenish tissue, new cells aren’t always laid out in the neat pattern that makes up the rest of the skin — resulting in a visible scar.</p><img id="i-c085e4c29c660760" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/23/4CC31E2200000578-0-image-a-1_1528151982814.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Brainy body: A scar is testimony to the incredible power of our bodies to heal. As soon as a wound occurs, our skin tries to close it as quickly as possible, to prevent infection" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the fibroblasts make too much collagen, this leads to a raised scar. These fall into two common types: keloid scars, which are red, thick and bumpy and spread beyond the original wound; and hypertrophic scars, which are also raised and red, but more contained, and often follow surgery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We don’t know what causes keloid scars to form, and anyone can get them after any type of wound, but they are more common on the upper chest and shoulders and in people with darker skin.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">A third common scar type is atrophic. These pitted scars are caused by skin damage as a result of inflammation, typically following chickenpox or acne. Here, not enough collagen is produced during rapid healing, creating a ‘divot’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many scars will fade on their own as, over time, some collagen breaks down and the blood supply reduces, causing the scar to become smoother, softer and paler.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Scar healing actually continues long after a wound closes, but is usually complete after 12 to 18 months,’ says Dr Nevianna Bordet, a consultant dermatologist at West Suffolk Hospital. After 18 months, it’s unlikely a scar will fade any further by itself — but their appearance can be improved.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here, we asked Dr Bordet, who also works at Spire Cambridge Lea Hospital, to review a selection of scar treatments, and we then rated them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="health-ccox">Homecraft Scar Management Mini Massager</span></strong></p><img id="i-688a21de4f70d4d1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/23/4CE972F000000578-5805683-image-a-25_1528152353613.jpg" height="195" width="306" alt="Help?

The maker recommends using it three to five times a day, with a water-based skin lotion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>EXPERT VERDICT</strong>: There is a lot of evidence showing that massaging a scar on a daily basis helps to reduce its height, restore tissue flexibility and ease pain or itching — the latter is common as new cells are produced to pull together the wound, activating nerves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Firm massage at the early stage of a scar is thought to increase new cell growth and promote collagen ‘re-modelling’, so that it forms a neater, smoother pattern.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some people don’t like directly touching their scars, so this device could be helpful with that, and also isn’t too pricey.

It works by creating a protective layer over the scar, to stop it losing water.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Damaged skin needs moisture to heal, as dry skin has tiny cracks that can allow bacteria to enter — this can slow down healing by causing further inflammation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One benefit of silicone is that the layer is porous, allowing skin to ‘breathe’, which helps to speed up healing. Dermatologists typically use a silicone-based treatment, such as this affordable gel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Because it provides a flexible and transparent layer, it can be used on the face and other visible areas — even under make-up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I like the fact that, unlike most products, this contains silicone and nothing else, which means it is less likely to cause the skin irritation that can slow healing.

It’s not advised for use on raised scars.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>EXPERT VERDICT</strong>: Evidence suggests micro-needling — which has been offered in salons as a cosmetic treatment since the 2000s — works by creating tiny wounds, which the skin sees as trauma and reacts by producing more collagen in a bid to heal the ‘damage’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As this is ‘micro’ trauma, the amount of collagen produced is enough to improve skin’s texture, but not enough to cause more scarring.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, devices designed for home use can have shorter needles: here, they are 0.5 mm, compared to 3 mm in some salon devices. Longer ones may be more effective, as they reach a deeper level of the skin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Salon treatments tend be every four to six weeks. This product says it can be used up to three times a week, which could cause irritation if your skin is sensitive. Another worry with home devices is that they are not used in a sterile environment, so bacteria could penetrate the skin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This device could benefit pitted scars, but should be used with caution and sterilised between uses (the maker does advise this and provides a hand sanitising spray with the kit).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, I can’t find independent scientific evidence that argan oil would improve results more than a normal moisturiser. 6/10</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Dr Organic Scar and Stretch Mark Serum</strong></p><img id="i-fabd39756dcc37e7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/23/4CE9737C00000578-5805683-image-a-23_1528152340360.jpg" height="306" width="306" alt="DIY: Any benefit here is likely to be down to the action of massaging in the cream and improving the skin’s moisture levels" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">50ml, £4.49, Holland &amp; Barrett</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">CLAIM: A blend of vitamin E, algae and natural ingredients said to aid scar healing by ‘restoring the skin’s natural moisture levels’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>EXPERT VERDICT</strong>: The theory is that vitamin E penetrates the skin and improves the way that new collagen is laid down as wounds heal, thereby helping new skin to look flat and smooth.

As soon as a wound occurs, our skin tries to close it as quickly as possible, to prevent infection. The body gets to work rebuilding tissue by sending out fibroblasts, cells that make collagen, which is the support structure of the skin. However, in this race to repair itself and replenish tissue, new cells aren’t always laid out in the neat pattern that makes up the rest of the skin — resulting in a visible scar. Here, we asked an expert to review a selection of scar treatments, and we then rated them.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Peter Lloyd</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-05T00:45:15.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>How silicone is the key to erasing ugly scars</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-05T00:45:15.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5804011/Womans-late-stage-breast-cancer-cured-breakthrough-immunotherapy-treatment.html" title="'It feels miraculous and I am beyond amazed': Breast-cancer victim who was on the verge of dying reveals she has been CURED by a new immunotherapy treatment in a world first"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5803581/Furious-medics-flock-Twitter-blast-Jeremy-Hunt.html" title="'The main reason the NHS is in crisis’: Jeremy Hunt sparks a backlash from furious medics on the day he becomes the longest-serving health secretary in history"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5803491/Zapping-mans-private-parts-combat-erectile-dysfunction.html" title="Zapping a man's private parts with a mild electric current could be a real turn on: Unlikely therapy combats erectile dysfunction, scientists claim"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5802729/Mother-43-left-paralysed-bitten-GARDEN-tick.html" title="Mother, 43, is left paralysed, unable to speak and forced to eat food through a straw after being bitten in her GARDEN by a tick"></link></item><item><title>For years, we’ve exposed how mesh implants used to treat women incontinent after childbirth have left many in agony.

I just didn’t know what to do. She tried so hard to live with it but, in the end, she just gave up.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Philip, 59, a sculptor from the Gower Peninsula in remote South Wales, is describing the final years of his former partner, Lucinda Methuen-Campbell, the mother of their son, Angus, who is now 19.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lucinda, 58, committed suicide earlier this year. She was one of more than 100 patients to have complained of crippling pain after they received implantable surgical mesh to treat bowel problems.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The material used is the same as the controversial gynaecological mesh used to repair post-childbirth incontinence. In some women treated for incontinence, this material has fragmented and ‘migrated’, leaving many in permanent, agonising pain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some have suffered such severe nerve damage that they cannot walk and rely on wheelchairs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Following a long campaign by Good Health, the use of the vaginal mesh is now the subject of a government inquiry, but no date has yet been given for its conclusion.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But now, there are concerns about the mesh used in rectal surgery (rectopexy), with up to 100 patients given the mesh by a Bristol surgeon, Anthony Dixon, embarking on legal action — against Mr Dixon himself, as well as Southmead Hospital in Bristol where he worked for the NHS, and the Spire Bristol Hospital, where he practised privately.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most are patients who developed constipation and extreme pain in mid-life, which subsequently turned out to be the symptom of a prolapsed bowel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lucinda was a private patient of Mr Dixon. ‘She developed a bowel problem in 2013 and said she was in terrible pain,’ recalls Philip.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘She found Mr Dixon on the internet and went to see him as a private patient in December of that year.

Mr Dixon told me the bowel was going to be pulled up and stapled with titanium tacks to the base of my spine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I was so pleased something was being done. I didn’t question whether it would work.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But she says she’s been left in agonising pain, which has affected her marriage and her ability to work. She has since undergone further surgery to remove the embedded mesh, which has caused permanent nerve damage. ‘This has ruined the past eight years of my life,’ she adds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another of Mr Dixon’s patients, Ian Waterfield, 56, a former chef from Huddersfield, is one of the first men to report life-limiting damage caused by mesh surgery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A sports enthusiast who travelled the world swimming, skiing and attending music festivals, he developed digestive problems in mid-life, with bouts of projectile vomiting and severe constipation that began 14 years ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite several spells in hospital, his symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as irritable bowel syndrome — until 2009, when he was diagnosed with a prolapsed bowel. He was referred to Mr Dixon through the NHS and underwent the mesh repair operation in 2010. But the procedure did not work and led to repeated operations and the removal of a section of his bowel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I have been a complete wreck ever since,’ he says. ‘I don’t have a life, I have an existence. I can’t work and my relationship broke down because of this. I am in constant pain — it’s like bits of broken glass sticking into me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Some nights, I don’t bother going to bed. I only sleep for five minutes at a time.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sohier Elneil, a London-based gynaecologist who specialises in repairing injuries linked to implanted surgical mesh, has become a vociferous campaigner against its use for women with incontinence.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She believes rectopexy is now unravelling as a potential problem area, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘In the past year, I have done repairs on 15 of Mr Dixon’s patients,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There is a problem with the material itself — disintegrating and moving around inside people’s bodies — and with the technique being used to insert it.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to lawyer Madeleine Pinschof, of Thompsons Solicitors, who is representing 61 of Mr Dixon’s patients, the complaints about Mr Dixon ‘are mostly about whether the operations were appropriate in the first place’. She says some of the complaints relate to surgery that was performed up to ten years ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last August, restrictions were placed on Mr Dixon’s practice by the General Medical Council, preventing him from carrying out bowel repair surgery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chris Burton, the medical director of North Bristol NHS Trust, which operates Southmead Hospital, would not tell Good Health when Mr Dixon had stopped treating patients at the hospital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: ‘[Mr Dixon] is not currently providing any clinical services to patients at our hospital. We would like to reassure patients that we are taking this very seriously and our investigations are continuing. It would be inappropriate for us to comment on specific details while our investigations are ongoing.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Jean-Jacques de Gorter, medical director of the Spire Group, said it had suspended Mr Dixon’s practising privileges pending the investigation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As the Mail has reported, last Friday, an inquest into Lucinda Methuen-Campbell’s death concluded she had taken her own life because of intractable pain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lucinda’s family say she had experienced mental health problems — which worsened after the death of her own mother in 2013 — before she saw Mr Dixon.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her sister, Catherine, 53, a mother-of-four who lives in Lewes, East Sussex, says: ‘We can’t say if she killed herself because of the mesh. Mr Dixon should never have touched her, but he wasn’t to know she was mentally ill because she saw him as a private patient and her GP would not have told him.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Details of patients’ complaints were put to Mr Dixon by Good Health through the Medical Protection Society, a doctors’ insurance company which is co-ordinating his defence. He declined to comment, citing patient confidentiality.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman for NHS Resolution, which deals with litigation by patients, said it is currently negotiating a group ‘protocol’ to cover the various types of compensation claims against Mr Dixon, but he said as more claimants are continuing to come forward, the process is ‘ongoing’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">For confidential support in the UK, call the Samaritans on 116 123 or visit a local Samaritans branch — see samaritans.org for details.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Lucinda Methuen-Campbell, 58, from the Gower Peninsula in remote South Wales, committed suicide earlier this year.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Carbs have been my downfall — I love eating them so much that my 6ft frame once ballooned to 19st as a result (egg fried rice and custard tarts, if you must know). I dropped that to 13st through dieting, but still constantly have to watch my weight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In making my new <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/bbc/index.html" id="mol-5b229250-6843-11e8-9d95-43ff4b3e4088">BBC</a> television programme, The Truth About Carbs, I went on a mission, talking to leading experts to find out how to be clever with carbs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So much dieting nowadays is all-or-nothing. People often try to banish all carbs from their diets. As I know from personal experience, this can just make people miserable — and is therefore almost impossible to sustain.</p><img id="i-d8eda58af923d77" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/22/4CE978F800000578-5805491-image-a-3_1528148427999.jpg" height="599" width="634" alt="Test: The cracker test is a quick and easy way to see how many carbs you should be eating" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But as I’ve now learned, not all carbohydrates are created equal. Some are very good for us, though many are indeed bad, causing us to pile on weight, raise our risk of diabetes and even threatening our fertility.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Learning to eat carbs more intelligently has helped me control my weight more easily. As a medical doctor with a degree in public health, I’m convinced it could bring similar benefits to millions of Britons. Here’s how to live happily on good carbs — and avoid the worst.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>TEST THAT REVEALS IF CARBS MAKES YOU FAT </strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A lucky few can eat carb-heavy foods without piling on fat — because our bodies can process them very efficiently.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many of us aren’t so fortunate. The cracker test is a quick and easy way to see how many carbs you should be eating.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Simply chew on a plain cracker until it changes in flavour from a bland biscuit to quite sweet. If the taste changes in less than 30 seconds, your body probably processes carbs quite effectively.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But if the cracker hasn’t changed taste after 30 seconds, then you should seriously consider eating a lower carb diet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Sharon Moalem, the Canadian geneticist who created this test, says a very slow (or no) taste change shows that your body doesn’t process carbs efficiently. This leads to perilous weight gain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The physiological mechanisms behind this test have not been nailed down completely — it’s probably genetic, reflecting levels of amylase, an enzyme in saliva, which breaks starch down into sugar for the body to use for energy. Some people have saliva that’s loaded with amylase (up to 50 times more than others) and break down carbs more readily, hence the sugary taste.</p><img id="i-3d4d2bb5ed66023b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/22/4CBD918700000578-5805491-image-a-11_1528148524242.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="How does your body react? But if the cracker hasn’t changed taste after 30 seconds, then you should seriously consider eating a lower carb diet" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you notice the sweetness within 0 to 14 seconds, your body processes carbs efficiently for use as energy — you can have 250g of carbs a day (roughly four slices of wholewheat bread).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If it takes 15 to 30 seconds, you can have 175g of carbs a day (around three-and-a-half slices of wholewheat bread).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More than 30 seconds, you’re not a great processor of carbs so the body is less able to use the excess as energy, and so stores it as fat. So you can have just 125g of carbs a day (around three slices of wholewheat bread).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When I did the test, it took me 34 seconds to taste the sweetness — unsurprisingly, given my history of weight gain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>CUT BACK ON BEIGE AND WHITE CARBS </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Beige’ carbs and ‘white’ carbs are the bad carbs and we eat far too much of them. Beige carbs are those in foods with lots of starch, such as potatoes, pasta, rice and white bread.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">White carbs are found in sugary foods such as fizzy drinks, sweets and processed and refined foods including cakes and biscuits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The problem is that most of the starch and sugar in bad carbs are broken down into glucose for energy. If you eat too much, the glucose is stored as fat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there are some carbs we’re not getting enough of — ‘green’ carbs. These are the dietary fibre found in fruit and veg, which releases energy very slowly. It’s good for our gut and doesn’t tend to make us fat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>GOOD CARBS HELP PREVENT CANCER </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most starchy carbohydrates — such as potatoes and white bread — are easily and quickly digested. But about 5 per cent of it is far less digestible: it gets right through the stomach to the bowel. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We call this ‘resistant starch’. This type of carbohydrate is particularly bountiful in high-fibre foods such as lentils, beans and unprocessed whole grains.</p><img id="i-34c52b9230046129" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/22/4CC2F5F500000578-5805491-image-a-1_1528148375577.jpg" height="634" width="634" alt="Slice of life: Scientists have discovered that cooking and cooling turns some of the beige and white carbs into resistant starches" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Resistant starch feeds the growth of beneficial bacteria in the bowel. These bacteria in turn produce chemicals that prevent diseases such as cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This explains why eating the recommended 30g a day of dietary fibre can reduce your chances of bowel cancer by 30 per cent.What’s more, these resistant starches have another key benefit — our bodies take only around half the calories from them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="health-ccox">RE-HEAT PASTA TO MAKE IT 'GOOD'</span> </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can turn ‘bad carbs’ into good ones. Scientists have discovered that cooking and cooling turns some of the beige and white carbs into resistant starches. The effect works best if you reheat carby foods such as pasta, rice and potatoes (make sure everything, especially rice, is piping hot).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What happens is that when the food is cooked and then cools down, fats and oils in the surrounding food attach themselves to the starch molecules, which makes them harder to digest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So when you pop last night’s lasagne into the microwave the following day, you’re doing your health a favour. Yes, it is all right to eat bread!</p><img id="i-48f7688a759eec91" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/22/152F3B38000005DC-5805491-image-m-14_1528149591332.jpg" height="875" width="634" alt="Food for thought: Dr Xand van Tulleken (right) with his doctor brother, Christopher" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But you should switch from mass-produced breads to rye bread or stoneground wholemeal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These are still deliciously bready but are much better for your weight and gut health — and keep you feeling fuller for longer. Sixty per cent of the bread we eat is white. It’s full of starch that turns into fat-producing glucose before it reaches your bowel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, stoneground wholegrain and rye breads contain the fibrous resistant starch that our bodies struggle to break down into glucose, and which instead feeds our gut bacteria.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But check the sugar content on the packaging of wholemeal breads because some large brands add sugar to counteract the bitterness of the whole grain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>EAT WHITE BREAD FROM THE FREEZER </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many of us maintain that only white bread will do when it comes to toast. If you must have it, there is a way of making it a little healthier (though it’s still not as good as wholemeal or rye). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And that’s to freeze your white bread first. Then stick it in the toaster straight from the freezer. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Freezing turns ordinary starch carbs into resistant starch, so your body gets far fewer calories from the bread. In effect, the resistant starch feeds your gut bacteria not you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>SPIT-OUT THOSE SPORTS DRINKS </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Carb-laden sports drinks claim to give you extra energy to exercise, but do you need them?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the TV programme, I completed two gruelling half-hour time trials on an exercise bike. Each time I swilled my mouth with water or sugared water. But I didn’t swallow any of it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just rinsing my mouth with sugared water enabled me to cycle 600m more than with water alone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That’s a massive difference. And it comes down to a brain trick. Sugary sports drinks prompt receptors in your mouth to tell your brain to expect a burst of carbs. Your brain then tells your body it’s OK to expend more energy, because fresh sugary carbs are on their way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But you don’t have to swallow the liquid to get this effect. And just a solution of sugar in water will do just fine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>HOW CARBS CAN HURT FERTILITY </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Recent research shows that overconsumption of refined ‘bad’ carbs can lead to fertility problems. We’re still in the process of discovering precisely how these mechanisms work, but Grace Dugdale, a reproductive biologist and researcher at the Leeds Centre for Reproductive Medicine, told me that if you eat lots of refined carbs, they rapidly convert into blood sugar and create spikes of energy that damage the mitochondria — the batteries that provide power for the cells in eggs and sperm, which are really important for their quality.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Grace is using a low-carb diet to help couples become fertile.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>SMALL STEPS FOR A BIG DIFFERENCE </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eating carbs more intelligently involves making small dietary adjustments. This may mean, for example, eating cauliflower (green carb) cheese rather than macaroni (beige) cheese.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A few of the bigger changes I’ve made include:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">- Making a big pot of porridge that I reheat in batches so it’s full of resistant starch;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">- Eating much more celariac than I ever did — it’s a great substitute for roasties</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">- Buying my bread from a baker and getting them to slice it — making one trip per month — and then freezing it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">- Swapping good carbs for bad not only slims you down but improves your blood-sugar levels, crucial for beating diabetes — without making you hungry or miserable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">The Truth About Carbs, BBC1, 8pm, tomorrow.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Learning to eat carbs more intelligently has helped Dr Xand Van Tulleken control his weight more easily.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The brain scans revealed that when the volunteers smelled the infected samples, there was heightened activity in an area called the intraparietal sulcus — involved with filing sensory experiences into our memory — labelling the smells’ owners as people to avoid.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Professor Olsson believes that we instinctively do this to avoid catching their bugs. He says: ‘The human brain is actually very good at discovering infection and this motivates avoidance behaviour.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other research he has done indicates that people’s repulsion to disease odour may stimulate a mild immune reaction, to protect them further against disease.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Emotional disgust is there to keep us healthy,’ he adds.

A study in March claimed to have the answer: it’s a protein that plays a crucial role in our bodies’ defence systems, called tumour necrosis factor (TNF).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The TNF protein signals to tissues in the body to become inflamed, in order to produce chemicals that fight infections.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">U.S. biologists at Wake Forest University in North Carolina have discovered that when TNF prompts inflammation in infected people, it also changes the chemical signature of their body odour, by subtly altering the normal ratios of chemicals that comprise it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This changed signature may be interpreted by others as an ‘avoid’ sign, to prevent disease spreading, says Dr Patrick Millet, who led the research, published in the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He hopes to learn to read these chemical messages in detail as a new way of providing early diagnoses of illness. Meanwhile, a British scientist believes that she can already achieve this, to diagnose Parkinson’s disease long before symptoms start.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Professor Perdita Barran, an analytical chemist at the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, was inspired by Joy Milne, 67, who made headlines last year by demonstrating that she could discern a distinct odour on people with Parkinson’s.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the Eighties, Joy complained to her husband, Les, then in his mid-30s, that his sweat smelt bad. Ten years later, he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Joy, a retired nurse, only linked the distinctive odour to the disease after meeting people with the same smell at a support group for the charity Parkinson’s UK.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since then, Professor Barran’s team has collected more than 800 samples of sebum, an oily substance secreted by the skin, from volunteers. In those with Parkinson’s, preliminary tests have found significantly raised levels of several molecules. These could create a unique diagnostic ‘nose-print’ for the disease, says Professor Barran. Her full results are awaiting publication.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It seems we can detect good health from each other, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Two years ago, researchers asked 82 women to rate the attractiveness of sweat samples taken from 42 men. The University of Stirling study, published in the journal Appetite, found that samples from men who habitually ate the most garlic were rated the most pleasant, attractive and least intense-smelling.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why should this be? The study suggested that garlic’s antioxidant and antimicrobial properties may foster low levels of inflammation and this may be transmitted through sweat as a sign of robust wellbeing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>You don’t consciously notice the danger signs: they are too subtle.

Elaine says:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'One of the biggest shocks about being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes was learning that the low-fat yoghurts I’ve been eating because I thought they were ‘healthier’ could have contributed to my hidden sugar intake and to me then getting the condition.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Two years ago, I started feeling really tired.

I only found out by chance, after a private health MOT six years ago revealed my blood sugar was high.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The diagnosis seemed to come out of nowhere, with no obvious symptoms — though, in hindsight, I’d been waking up in the morning feeling thirsty and sometimes at night too.

Even he can’t understand why a young woman who is a size 8-10 and does cardio workouts at the gym four times a week should develop the condition.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was picked up quite randomly two years ago. I’d gone to see my GP for a thyroid test as I’d been feeling tired. He did tests and said my blood sugar was a touch high, but because I was such an unlikely candidate for diabetes, he said he’d see me again a few months later to check if it was just a blip.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is diabetes in my family, but type 1. My father was diagnosed when he was a teenager and has been taking insulin since.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Further blood tests a few months later confirmed I did have type 2. (They said it wouldn’t be type 1, as typically it’s diagnosed younger and makes you ill very quickly.)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It took me about six months to come to terms with my condition — both physically and emotionally. I cut out carbs and ate more protein, such as chicken and eggs, to prevent spikes in blood sugar, but I couldn’t get my levels within the recommended range, so I was prescribed gliclazide and metformin. Now I’m at normal levels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I can’t help wondering, over and over again, why it has happened</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>EXPERT COMMENT</strong>: Francesca’s situation is by no means typical, since she is not only slim and healthy but also so young, says Dr Maksoud. Type 2 usually happens in people from the age of 40.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cases like this could be a condition that behaves like but isn’t type 2 diabetes. One possibility is maturity onset diabetes of the young, which is a form of diabetes caused by a gene mutation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Or it could be latent autoimmune diabetes of adults — a form of type 1 diabetes that develops later in adulthood and is treated with injected insulin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Alternatively, Francesca may have a health issue linked to insulin production, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, which can cause insulin resistance,’ he suggests.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He advises Francesca to raise this with her consultant, so she can get tested for these conditions, just to be sure that she does have type 2 diabetes — as if not, she may need different medication or insulin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>RUNNER TREATED WITH STEROIDS</strong></p><img id="i-a0ff39b9c5ae74b1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/21/4CE9286800000578-5805317-image-a-9_1528144856310.jpg" height="682" width="306" alt="Side-effect: Stewart Jeffries, 54, developed it after having chemotherapy for leukaemia" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stewart Jeffries, 54, a sales rep, lives in Manchester with his wife Janice, 60, a radiographer.

Twelve years ago, I was successfully treated with chemotherapy for leukaemia, and ever since I’ve been determined to stay fit. I was never overweight but I took up running in 2011 and now run three times a week. I don’t smoke and I’ve also never been more than an occasional drinker.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before my diabetes diagnosis, my only ‘bad’ habit was drinking sugary cola sometimes and eating chocolate a few times a week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I hadn’t been feeling unwell, but on quite a long car journey four years ago, I found myself needing the loo every hour or so. I assumed it was a prostate issue, but blood tests revealed I had high blood sugar and type 2 diabetes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They didn’t really know why I’d developed it, although my brother, who’s 18 months older, also has it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was able to control it through diet until three months ago, when my blood sugar levels became a nudge too high and I was put on metformin to help control them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>EXPERT COMMENT</strong>: Stewart’s treatment for leukaemia involved steroid drugs to protect him from the effects of chemotherapy, and this might have affected the function of the pancreas — insulin is released from the cells in the pancreas, says Dr Sharma. This can also happen with long-term use of steroids for other conditions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, having sugary drinks little but often, as Stewart did, may have had an impact too, as this can lead to a reduction in insulin production.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Short bursts of high levels of glucose, as you’d get from a sugary drink, over time can reduce the body’s ability to produce insulin and can, in some people, precipitate diabetes,’ Dr Sharma says</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The fact that his brother has type 2 could suggest a genetic link. ‘If you have a parent, brother or sister with type 2 diabetes, then that increases your risk by 6 per cent.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MOTHER WHO GOT IT IN PREGNANCY</strong></p><img id="i-a1822360f63f03fa" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/21/4CE9283F00000578-5805317-image-a-13_1528145009842.jpg" height="519" width="306" alt="Motherhood: Jenna Russell, 28, developed the condition during her pregnancy" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jenna Russell, 28, is a stay-at-home mother and lives near Grimsby with her partner John, 35, and their son Max, nine.

Basically, your body can’t produce enough insulin to meet the extra needs of the growing baby. It was quite unexpected.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it didn’t worry me too much as I was told it would disappear once I’d had the baby. I was told to eat healthily and keep active.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After my son was born, I was tested every year for diabetes as a precaution My blood sugar readings were fine, though I did keep getting urinary tract infections. They could sometimes be really bad and I’d get pain in my kidneys too. At the age of 26, tests showed I had sugar in my urine and I was diagnosed with type 2.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Frankly, I was devastated. I was a young woman with a young child. It didn’t make any sense.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was put on metformin but it made me terribly sick and I gave it up after several months. Now, I inject Victoza every day, which increases insulin production.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I try to keep active by swimming and going to yoga but I also suffer with unrelated fibromyalgia, which causes pain throughout the body, so it’s not always easy to exercise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I think all this is especially hard for my son. When my diabetes causes an unexpected ‘hypo’ — when blood sugar falls too low, a side-effect of the drugs used to control the condition — I slur my words and I’m wobbly on my feet, which is quite scary for Max.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>EXPERT COMMENT</strong>: Gestational diabetes affects 4 to 5 per cent of pregnant women and a third of them are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes within five to ten years, says Dr Sharma. It can be random but high blood pressure or family history of type 2 may increase risk.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Jenna’s case, her urinary tract infections were a sign she was developing type 2, as increased sugar in the blood and then the urine enables bacteria to multiply.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jenna’s fibromyalgia can make it difficult to stay active but she should try to get outside as much as she can as vitamin D is good for insulin resistance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Maksoud adds: ‘Jenna eats healthily but it’s important to eat more vegetables than fruit, as dates, grapes, melon, bananas and mango can all raise blood sugar.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">For more information, visit: diabetes.co.uk</span></p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-c3f56750-6837-11e8-a69e-a3c68f51b5b6">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">THE TEST EVERYONE MUST HAVE</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Diabetes is diagnosed in a number of ways, but traditionally this has been with a urine or blood test to check glucose levels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The HbA1c blood test is a newer, more accurate test which can be used to diagnose the condition, though it’s more commonly given to monitor people already diagnosed with type 2 as it gives a picture of their blood sugar levels over 12 weeks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the body processes sugar, glucose in the bloodstream naturally sticks to a protein in red blood cells called haemoglobin, and the HbA1c test checks on how much of the haemoglobin has been ‘glycated’ in this way.

Training outside in the park, with your kids, in a family class, is an epic thing to do.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2) Volunteer</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>One lesson I’ve learned as Chief Scout is that the happiest people I meet are those who give up time for other people. Volunteering changes people’s lives. We just launched this new initiative with thousands of Scouts going into homes and helping those with dementia. Lead by example as parents. I’m not very good at sending my kids out to go and do something. I’m much better at saying: ‘Kids, come and join me, let’s do something all together.’</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">3) Dig it</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A vegetable patch is great. There’s nothing better than growing your own, even if it’s just watercress. It’s primal and makes you feel good inside.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4) Down on the farm</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Visit an open farm. It’s a really interesting day out. And it’s important for kids to actually see what happens with animals and to understand a bit about where food comes from. You’re outside, you’re educating them, it’s fascinating. The parents win. The kids win. The farmer wins. Everyone wins.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">5) On your bike</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s a network of incredible bike trails all over the country. Cycling’s always fun to do together. There are places now where you can just turn up, rent a bike for a few hours and do some downhill descents. But even in the city, going along a canal in Manchester or London, kids never tire of riding bikes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>6) Park up</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>National parks are the under-appreciated heroes of our country. I’ve travelled all over the world but I still come back and go: ‘Wow!’ We really, truly live in the most beautiful country. So get into the National Parks and just explore and use your imagination a bit.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">7) Go down to the woods</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The forest is where you get to camp, to sit by the brook, to look at the birds. And like Hansel and Gretel, make sure you mark your route when you go in and go out. There’s nothing better than saying to kids: ‘Every 200 metres we’ve got to build a little cairn of twigs in the shape of an arrow to point the way we’ve come, so we can get back.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>8) Sleep under the stars</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Spend the night outdoors – it can even be in your own garden. It’s amazing how many people have never actually slept outside. Even if it all goes wrong and pours with rain, you get soaking wet and end up running for cover, you’ll end up laughing about it.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">9) Watch a film outside</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Make an outdoor cinema. Pin out a sheet between two trees. Get a little cheap projector and show a great movie. There’s something great about doing that sitting outside with a drink, with your family, on beanbags.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>10) Climb a mountain</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>There’s something symbolic for man, woman and child, just standing together at the top of a mountain.</strong></p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘When we first had children here, my mother and Shara’s mother were saying, “You’ve got to move off the houseboat – they’ll fall in the river.” It’s a ripper of a tide. It’s dangerous water. For half the day it’s racing past us.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But I always said, “Tarzan grew up in the jungle but he figured out how to stay alive and manage risks.” ’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The boys are better for the experience, he insists. ‘They are all super-savvy around boats. They’ve got great balance. So we’ve done them a service.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wouldn’t he be saying something different if one of them had fallen overboard?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘No, because you’re with them. They fall off when you take your eye off the ball.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bear admits he was often absent in those early years, leaving Shara to struggle on her own. ‘The first seven years I was away all the time, because I had no control over anything. Now we own all the TV shows, we plan when we do them and we film super-fast. The priorities for all the people in the office are really clear: “Number one, stay safe. Number two, time with family. Number three, what I’m doing has to be fun. Number four, it’s got to be empowering for other people. And number five, it’s got to earn well.” Don’t put the earning at the top just because the deal is great. If I’m away too much, then it’s not fun.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now this very wealthy family also has a swish London apartment, an estate in Wiltshire and that island near Anglesey. They also spend the winter months in the Alps, where Bear films many of his survival shows and two of his sons go to an international school.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jesse is at boarding school in this country, despite Bear admitting in his autobiography that he loathed being a boarder. ‘Jesse didn’t start off as a boarder but after a year he said, “I really want to board, a lot of my friends are.” You’ve got to listen to your children.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What does he think about teenagers being constantly glued to their mobile phones? ‘I’m not militant about phones but you’ve got to teach kids how to use them responsibly and respectfully. Phones are there to serve you rather than for you to serve them.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That said, he’s not above playing the strict father. ‘I did this thing with friends of Jesse when they came round: if I caught them looking at their phones at supper, they’d have to do press-ups.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bear is a Christian, so are his home values based on faith? ‘The heart of my faith says I’m loved despite my failings and that we’re called on this Earth to try to shine light and love other people. I suppose those values are at the root of how we like to try to bring up our children.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Does that mean going to church? ‘Not very often. I’m not very good with church. Sometimes you come across these wonderful churches, but for me church is something that’s often put me off faith. It’s been a life journey to realise that’s OK.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is a surprise, given that his face is all over the posters for the Alpha Course, designed to introduce people to Christianity – and ultimately get them into church.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Alpha is wonderful,’ he says. ‘It’s a way of helping people understand that faith is in here [the heart] and it’s a stumbling journey, but it’s certainly not about bricks and mortar.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Is it hard bringing up kids without spoiling them if you’re rich? ‘We set the boundaries. Our eldest says, “I get the smallest amount of pocket money of all my friends.” But I want to teach him there’s value to money, so the boys have a star chart: if they want shoes that are £80, they need 30 chores to get there, or whatever it is.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I say, “Whatever you save, I’ll double.” There’s quite a lot of cheating that goes on, but it’s all part of the experience.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for family holidays, Bear offers his top tips, above, for making the best of the British outdoors. Surprisingly, the rest of the family have to work really hard to get him to the beach. ‘I actually don’t like sand,’ he laughs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hang on. This is the man who famously taught us how to survive in a sandstorm by sleeping inside the carcass of a dead camel, and who even made a show training with the French Foreign Legion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘On day one, they go, “Right, for the next six hours, we’re going to shovel sand from here to the other side of the barracks.” I said, “It’s a desert!” but they replied, ‘Don’t answer back!’ So I’m not great with sand. That’s why I love where we live in Wales. Straight off the rocks, dive into the sea. Epic. I have to get dragged to a sandy beach by my family.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This all sounds very macho but what if one of his boys would rather stay in and read a book? ‘We totally have that, and that’s wonderful. In our house there is so little pressure to be outdoorsy. I happen to have two boys who live for the outdoors, but the other one loves his cooking and stuff like that. Lucky us!’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it turns out that when he’s not up a mountain, the mighty Bear likes nothing better than to end the day with a cuddle. ‘We love being cosy as a family. Nothing nicer than all getting into bed together and reading books. It’s heaven.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Bear Grylls looks like a man who has everything: fame, fortune, friends including Barack Obama, a wife he loves and three young boys. But the world’s best-loved adventurer is keen to let his sons know that it wasn’t always like this. As Bear prepares to join us as a new Life columnist, writing about his family and other adventures, it’s time to find out the truth about the home life of the former SAS soldier best known for climbing mountains, surviving in the wild with A-listers and being a rather handsome devil. Bear was an SAS reservist and survival instructor, broke his back in a parachuting accident and climbed Everest just 18 months later – all before he was spotted making a motivational speech by a television producer. Initially he was too shy to want to appear on TV, but his wife Shara (inset) said he should have a go, not least because at the time, in 2005, they had no money.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Rod Ardehali</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-03T08:28:07.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Bear Grylls champions the joy of outdoor living as a parent</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-03T08:28:07.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5787775/Made-Chelsea-Melissa-Tattam-bikini-Melissa-Jay-calls-Size-10-Large.html" title="Made In Chelsea star Melissa Tattam's bikini brand is selling UK size 10 bottoms as LARGE - and campaigners warn she's setting an 'unhealthy' example to teenage fans "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5797989/How-woman-21-converted-10-000-savings-booming-3-MILLION-bikini-label.html" title="How a glamorous university student, 21, turned a bikini label she started in her parents' laundry into a multi-million dollar juggernaut - as she reveals her next daring move to expand the ever-growing empire"></link></item><item><title>Go wild this summer!

But is eating it doing us any good? Here we examine the facts (and some myths) to help you decide if you need to get some in…</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>LESS PAINFUL JOINTS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Numerous trials have concluded that the spice – or rather, its active ingredient curcumin, which makes up around three per cent of the powdered spice – could help ease the pain of arthritis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most arthritis studies have used a concentrated extract of the spice containing at least 500mg curcumin, which would equate to over five and a half teaspoons of turmeric powder. But at these sort of levels it’s a promising treatment. In a small 2012 pilot study, a concentrated pill form of curcumin under the brand name BCM95 reduced joint pain and swelling in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis better than diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Biocurcumax (£21.99 from bioturm.co.uk) supplies the BM95 form with 650mg in a daily dose of two capsules.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>LOWER DIABETES RISK?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A study published in Diabetes Care in 2012, found that people with prediabetes who took curcumin for nine months had improved function of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. About 240 people were involved in the study and, after nine months of treatment 16 per cent of subjects in the placebo group were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, but none in the curcumin-treated group.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The results sound impressive but need replicating, ideally with lower dosages, as the amounts used in this study were in a concentrated curcumin supplement form – equating to 16 teaspoons of turmeric powder. It’s more easily achieved by taking three capsules daily of a 500mg supplement such as Opti-Turmeric (£18.95 for 50 capsules from health span.co.uk) – though the recommended daily dose is two.</p><img id="i-6a5d145b7987495" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/20/4CD6E44400000578-0-image-a-40_1527966636415.jpg" height="433" width="306" alt="A study published in Diabetes Care in 2012, found that people with prediabetes who took curcumin for nine months had improved function of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>BALM FOR THE BOWELS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A handful of small clinical trials suggests that curcumin can help people with ulcerative colitis. A study in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology in 2015 found that for people with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis taking the standard medication of mesalamine, the addition of a high-dose curcumin supplement (equivalent to 30-plus teaspoons of turmeric powder) helped half of them achieve remission after four weeks. None given a placebo benefited.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More trials are needed to confirm the findings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>CALM THE BLOOD PRESSURE</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Curcumin supplements may improve the ability of blood vessels to dilate and expand, which enables blood pressure to normalise during stress. In a 2012 Japanese study involving 32 post-menopausal women split into three groups, those who took high- dose curcumin supplements had the same improvement in artery flexibility as those who did aerobic exercise. A placebo group saw no improvement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An Iranian study reported in Phytotherapy Research in 2013 also found a reduction in triglycerides in those taking 1g curcumin a day – about 11 teaspoons of turmeric powder or 2 x 500mg curcumin capsules. Elevated levels of triglycerides make the blood sticky and thick, increasing the risk of clots.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WHAT DOESN’T IT WORK FOR?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite some promising laboratory research on brain cells, studies looking at turmeric and brain functions have mostly found little or no benefit. As for people with Alzheimer’s disease, studies ‘have not been able to generate the anticipated benefits of curcumin’, a review in the British Journal Of Nutrition in 2016 found.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cancer Research UK say that studies with cancer and turmeric look promising but that more clinical trials in humans are needed before we will know if it has any potential to treat cancer. Generally speaking, a minimum dose of two 500mg capsules of curcumin per day may give you the best chance of reaping health benefits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>CAN’T I JUST STIR IT INTO FOOD?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2016, The Mail on Sunday’s health columnist Dr Michael Mosley and Newcastle University, demonstrated how one daily teaspoon of turmeric, taken for six weeks, has the power to manipulate genes – even those involved in depression, asthma, eczema and cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The study used a smaller, more achievable dose than other studies, and still showed a benefit. But that was with turmeric added to food – neither a supplement of the same dosage nor a placebo showed this beneficial effect. One theory is that adding oil or heating (as in a curry or stir-fry for example) could make the curcumin more soluble and easier to absorb. Curcumin dissolves in fat, not water, and studies show that consuming it with black pepper boosts absorption by 2,000 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So having turmeric in food is probably the better bet, but consistency of intake is key. Anything from one to five-and-a-half teaspoons of 90-500mg curcumin taken every day is the suggested minimum dose of turmeric powder.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When scouring high street and online stores for turmeric-containing products we went with the achievable one teaspoon a day yardstick for measuring potential benefit. We know this amount may have beneficial effects and doesn’t cause known downsides such as reduced iron absorption and gastric reflux.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In reality, you’re more likely to be getting too little than too much from everyday products.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So which are going to leave you glowing and which were little more than fool’s gold?

<p class="mol-para-with-font">A report last week, written by obesity experts at the University of Oxford, hailed rigorous ‘crash diets’ as effective tools for reducing the waist lines of our increasingly obese nation. Professor Susan Jebb, who wrote the report, suggested that strict, 800-calorie diets should be prescribed on the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-0c5f9650-66a8-11e8-87f3-99ed43d7c56f">NHS</a> to individuals in need of dramatic <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-0c5fe470-66a8-11e8-87f3-99ed43d7c56f">weight loss</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite the expert backing, many have been up in arms, claiming that crash diets trigger ‘starvation mode’ which causes the metabolism to crash, meaning you end up putting all the weight back on.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the first study, called ‘Direct’, by Professors Roy Taylor and Mike Lean took 298 people with type 2 diabetes and randomly allocated them to an 800-calorie diet or standard care. At the end of a year, those on the 800-calorie diet were, on average, 1½st lighter and almost half had restored their blood sugars to normal without the use of medication. Those getting standard advice lost just over 2 lb and only four per cent of the group had put their diabetes into remission.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-2789f400-6696-11e8-9085-e9501fd60126">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Fruity Granitas </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><img id="i-a256d8261e4dd3e7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/19/4CD6E50400000578-0-image-a-26_1527965625177.jpg" height="197" width="128" alt="Fruity Granitas: Serves 6" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Serves 6</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">100g blueberries, (save some to serve)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">1 kiwi, peeled, (save some slices to serve)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">100g raspberries (save extra to serve)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Blitz the fruit separately, each with 100ml water, into purees and put into separate containers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Freeze for two hours then fluff up with a fork before freezing for three more hours.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Allow to sit out of the freezer for ten minutes before using a fork to scrape into a fluffy snow-like texture. Serve topped with the extra fruit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Higher-calorie version: Serve with 1 tbsp of natural yogurt per serving and a drizzle of honey.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The results of the second study, the Droplet trial, were announced as part of the report by Prof Jebb. It was also an 800-calorie diet, carried out for eight weeks, followed by a behavioural support programme. After a year Prof Jebb discovered that the 800-calorie group – all of whom were originally obese – had lost, and kept off, an average of 1½st, compared to ½st in obese individuals on a standard diet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She declared the results ‘phenomenal – extraordinary – like nothing we’ve seen in primary care before’. I was delighted because both studies support the rapid weight loss approach that I wrote about in my 8-Week Blood Sugar Diet book and in these pages when I revealed The New 5:2. The diets result in a rapid change which motivates people to continue.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That said, a rapid weight loss diet will not suit everyone including those under 18, who are not overweight or who have previously suffered from an eating disorder. If you are on medication you should also talk to your doctor before starting. Although 800 calories a day sounds like a ‘crash diet’, Prof Taylor says there is a world of difference between his precise recommendation and those low calorie diets that involve cutting out all food and guzzling glasses of green juice instead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We recommend a planned approach,’ he says. ‘Reduce food intake to 800 calories. Keep it low for eight weeks. Then have a stepped return to eating less than you used to.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I asked Dick Collard, a friend of mine who lost over three stone on my 800-calorie diet three years ago how he keeps the weight off. ‘It’s quite simple’, he told me. ‘I weigh myself every day, eat a relatively low-carb diet and walk three miles every day. I am never going back to the way I was’. And I wholeheartedly believe him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Time to give up fruit juice?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When my kids were young, my wife and I banned them from drinking fruit juice. Given the chance, they would drink gallons of the acidic stuff which would undoubtedly do terrible things to their teeth. But a recent survey has revealed that guzzling fruit juice can dramatically increase the risk of obesity too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Researchers at the Medical University of Vienna questioned 652 children about their breakfast habits, and found that those who drank fruit juice more than three times a week were twice as likely to be overweight or obese than those who didn’t. Children who opted for water slashed their risk of obesity by 40 per cent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One would think fruit juice is healthy given the quantity of vitamin-heavy fruit, but there are around 100 calories in a small, 200ml glass of apple juice and the equivalent of seven teaspoons of sugar. In addition, it doesn’t satisfy hunger pangs because almost all the fibre is stripped out via the juicing process. It is the fibre that fills you up and slows the rate of sugar absorbion, as well as fuelling the good bacteria that live in your gut.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The lesson must be: eat fruit rather than drinking it.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Your questions answered </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>I am a 55-year-old type 2 diabetic man and have eliminated my diabetic symptoms with diet, following your recommendations. But my GP tells me total elimination of this disease is impossible, even if I undertake the 800-calorie regime. Is she correct?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A plethora of new research by people like Professor Taylor (see above) provides evidence for the reversal of type 2 diabetes using dietary restriction, particularly if caught early. Despite this widely available information, most doctors still remain unaware of the therapeutic power of diet for this condition. A fact sheet detailing both the evidence, and guidance for implementing the diet is available to download from thebloodsugardiet.com. Show this to your GP.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>I am keen to try your 800-calorie diet to lose a stone, but I don’t like fruit, vegetables, salad or pasta. I like cod, chicken, meat, eggs, potatoes and tinned tuna/salmon. Can I still do the diet?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A diet filled with fresh fish, lean meat and eggs is a relatively healthy one and most suggested recipes in my 12-week plan feature these ingredients. I would encourage you to have another go at vegetables because they contain lots of fibre and other important micronutrients that can reduce the risk of some cancers, protect your bones and boost the immune system. Try veg when you’re particularly hungry. As as the French say, ‘hunger is the best sauce’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My 67-year-old wife is gluten intolerant and if she had regular pasta she would suffer stomach cramps, but with spelt pasta, she’d be fine. Is it true that not all gluten is the same?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Gluten intolerance is still an under-researched phenomenon, meaning it’s difficult to decipher if it is gluten, or other ingredients in food that is the direct cause of the gut symptoms. The best way to find out is to remove these foods from your diet and then, gradually reintroduce them – one by one – and record reactions in a food diary.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>A report last week, written by obesity experts at the University of Oxford, hailed rigorous ‘crash diets’ as effective tools for reducing the waist lines of our increasingly obese nation.

In many of them, the cancer had spread to their bones, usually a sign there is no more hope.</p><img id="i-49c0dd56e3d02ca0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/18/1AB2C3B100000514-5798717-image-a-22_1527961940021.jpg" height="412" width="634" alt="Men with otherwise untreatable prostate cancer could halt its spread and survive longer by undergoing immunotherapy treatment, a major trial in London has shown" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But according to results being presented in detail tomorrow at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago, more than a third of those treated with pembrolizumab were still alive after a year. And one in ten were still actively benefiting from treatment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Researchers found those with the best response had types of prostate cancer with ‘ultra-mutant cancer cells’ which change their genetic make-up quickly. Among these types are those linked to the BRCA gene, the mutation carried by actress Angelina Jolie, which is best known for raising the risk of breast and ovarian cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The results will bring hope to men such as BBC presenter Bill Turnbull, 62, who in March revealed that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer which had spread ‘to the bone’. Last month he told how he had ‘just had six rounds of chemo’ and was expecting to undergo more.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">World-leading prostate cancer expert Professor Johann de Bono, of the Institute for Cancer Research, said: ‘We hope for a cure but we can’t call it that yet. However, many of the men who were at death’s door have been on the drug for more than 18 months and show no signs of the disease.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Such patients had experienced ‘an amazing response’, he said. ‘Some of the patients on this trial are like Lazarus – they were dying of advanced disease. Some were almost too unwell to have any treatment at all and they have been resurrected.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pembrolizumab, also known by its brand name Keytruda, is one of a new class of drugs called ‘checkpoint inhibitors’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prof de Bono said the drug was ‘well tolerated’ by patients ‘with relatively few severe side effects’. He added: ‘The next stage is to try and develop tests to help us better identify which patients will benefit most.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prostate expert Dr David Graham at Levine Cancer Institute, North Carolina, said: ‘These men have the most aggressive type of disease and have been through the gamut of what we have available now. These findings show the glimmer of promise for them.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Further trials will be needed before the drug, already licensed for certain types of skin cancer, lung cancer and lymphoma, is approved for routine clinical use in prostate cancer. It will then have to be assessed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to see if it is cost-effective enough for prostate NHS cancer patients to receive it.</p><img id="i-c8e9e994fd26348a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/18/04D45D4A000007D0-0-image-m-4_1527961165177.jpg" height="406" width="306" alt="Former BBC presenter Bill Turnbull, who revealed in March he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is not a given, as a course of treatment in other cancers typically costs tens of thousands of pounds per patient.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The news comes as a major new study reveals that a simple blood test carried out in the GP’s surgery could detect up to half of deadly lung cancers in the earliest stages.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Experts say the findings should pave the way for routine screening for heavy smokers and others at high risk of lung cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite falling smoking rates, lung cancer is still Britain’s biggest cancer killer, claiming 35,000 lives every year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But now results from the ongoing Circulating Cell-Free Genome Atlas study, also presented at ASCO, offer hope of much earlier diagnosis – and so better survival.

More excitingly, it identified up to 50 per cent of early-stage tumours too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Professor Geoffrey Oxnard, of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in the US, said: ‘The beauty of a blood test is it could just be done in a local GP office.’</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Men with otherwise untreatable prostate cancer could halt its spread and survive longer by undergoing immunotherapy treatment, a major trial has shown. More than a third of men with a very advanced form of the cancer were still alive and one in 10 had not seen it grow after a year on the drug pembrolizumab, the study found. It is the first time immunotherapy has been shown to benefit some men with prostate cancer, the researchers said. The results of the trial, led by a team at the Institute of Cancer Research, London, and the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in Chicago.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Phoebe Southworth</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-03T01:37:06.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Men with untreatable prostate cancer could live longer</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-03T01:37:06.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5730609/Palestinian-president-hospital-minor-ear-procedure.html" title="Mahmoud Abbas, 82, is admitted to hospital for third time in less than a week in latest health scare to hit the Palestinian president"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5693251/James-Brokenshire-MP-beat-lung-cancer-got-Cabinet-four-months.html" title="From lung cancer to Cabinet in just four months: How James Brokenshire MP had a deadly tumour and a third of his organ removed, then went back to work"></link></item><item><title>DR MAX THE MIND DOCTOR: Why your teenager’s brain can’t cope with adult life </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5797331/DR-MAX-MIND-DOCTOR-teenagers-brain-cope-adult-life.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jun 2018 00:44:33 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5797331</guid><description><![CDATA[Being a teenager is tough.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Being a teenager is tough. When we think back to adolescence, most of us recoil at the horror of it all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Raging hormones and an unsettling awareness of our burgeoning sexuality. A body that seems out of control. Uncertainty about who we are, what we want in life and where we fit in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Throw into the mix the pressure of exams with the potential to dictate the rest of one’s life — well, who on earth would want to go through it again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Seriously, it is unquestionably bad timing that, just as young people are contending with huge emotional and physical change, we burden them further with the curse of GCSEs.</p><img id="i-da362849bd4565df" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/01/4CD43FA600000578-0-image-a-53_1527899509889.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="GCSEs could not be scheduled at a worse time for teenagers because of their hormones " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Neuroscientist Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore certainly thinks so. This week, she went so far as to suggest that from a neurological perspective, the exams should be scrapped because they come at the worst possible time in adolescent development.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While I wouldn’t predict the death of GCSEs any time soon, Professor Blakemore is right. Key parts of the teenage brain are still quite immature.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your child might look and talk like an adult, but scans show the prefrontal cortex is the last part of the brain to fully develop, and is undergoing change until well into the 20s. This part of the brain is emotional high command; the seat of impulse control, of foreseeing and judging consequences of behaviour, of initiating appropriate behaviour and inhibiting inappropriate behaviour, and of controlling our reaction to people and events.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Its relative immaturity is why teenagers behave the way they do. A teenager may understand that a particular action is wrong or dangerous, but they lack the hardwiring in their brain to properly process these thoughts in the way an adult does.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is why youngsters make particularly good Army recruits, because the prefrontal cortex that assesses risk is still immature (and why so many have quit by their mid-20s as the risk assessment part of the brain matures). Our greater understanding of the adolescent brain has many implications; for example in debates around the age of consent or giving the vote to 16-year-olds.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-7b0d18e0-65fc-11e8-91b8-995489d30900">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Here's one pill I love popping! </h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">I take a multivitamin every morning — but yet another study this week tells me that I am wasting my time and my money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Researchers found no clear benefit in taking vitamin supplements (except for vitamin D), and say that we should focus instead on improving our diet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But isn’t that the point? While we know we should be gobbling up plenty of fruit, veg, fibre, oily fish, beans and lentils etc, all too often, our busy lifestyles intervene.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So do I feel better since I started taking a dietary supplement? The answer is a resounding yes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In my view, the psychological power of pill-popping cannot be underestimated — and my daily multivitamin is why I feel entirely relaxed about opting for a banoffee pie instead of a banana. </p></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I know most teenagers would be furious at the suggestion, but brain scans don’t lie. From a neurological perspective, youngsters are impaired in their judgment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That’s why I worry about their easy access to online pornography. While an adult can view porn and, in the majority of cases, understand that this is not a blueprint for human relationships, the thinking of teenagers can be warped by this exposure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The impact of violent video games on young brains is also a concern, while the uninhibited use of social media, posting messages and, in some cases, inappropriate pictures of themselves, should alarm every parent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That’s the downside, but there is a positive to be taken from this. I’ve seen many teenagers with severe mental health problems who, given time, get better. Of course, mental health support helps, but really what’s happened is their neurological development has caught up and enabled them to regulate their emotions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’ve noticed this particularly in cases of self-harm, in which some youngsters resort to injuring themselves as a way of coping with stress or emotions that threaten to overwhelm them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When I worked in A&amp;E, we had one young woman who racked up more than 150 attendances. She was 17 and her forearms were covered in scars.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I eventually left that hospital, but returned a few years later. On my first night shift in A&amp;E, I noticed that same girl in the waiting area and my heart sank: nothing had changed for her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She recognised me, so I went over. ‘I think I’ve sprained my ankle,’ she said. ‘Oh, I assumed …’ I began. ‘No, I don’t do that now, not done it for ages,’ she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I asked how she’d stopped and she shrugged: ‘Don’t know, something in my head just sort of clicked.’ She gives me hope for even the most troubled teenager.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Gender gap that's unfair to MEN...</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was only a matter of time before the gender pay gap furore hit my profession. Cue the announcement this week by the Health Secretary that there is to be a review of an apparent 15 per cent pay gap among doctors.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let’s be sensible here. The pay scales for doctors are very clear. They are agreed nationally and are dependent on the number of years a doctor has spent in the NHS, irrespective of the speciality.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So an NHS consultant plastic surgeon earns the same pro rata as a consultant community paediatrician.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nor is gender a factor. It’s an entirely transparent and equitable system.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That’s not to say there isn’t a pay gap. On average, women are paid less than men — but they are not being paid less for doing the same job. That’s illegal. The reality is that, on average, male doctors work longer than women and so take home a higher salary. It’s not sexism — it’s just life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A 15-year follow-up of doctors after graduation showed that, after career breaks and part-time working are taken into account, women on average, usually because of family commitments, work 25 per cent less than their male counterparts. Put starkly, the average male medical graduate will work full-time, while the average female won’t.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is a gender issue in the health service, but it’s not the one that’s being discussed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More female students are accepted at medical school than male students, with a ratio of 60:40. A few institutions boast a 70 per cent female intake.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So shouldn’t we be looking at why boys are being out-performed by girls in the education system, why fewer young men are applying to, or being accepted at, medical school?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why aren’t we trying to address the clear gender inequality that is emerging in schools?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We are letting down an entire generation of young men because of a politically loaded agenda that is entirely deaf to their needs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong> It's dopey to claim cannabis is safe</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Can cannabis cure cancer? There’s not a shred of evidence to support such a claim, but that doesn’t stop the shrill pro-cannabis lobby from claiming otherwise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Campaigners have jumped on the case of 32-year-old Tiffany Youngs, wife of England rugby star Tom, who said this week that she believes cannabis oil helped to cure her of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Her claim has reignited the debate around cannabis, its alleged anti-cancer properties and, therefore, the case for decriminalising it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But contrary to what the pro-cannabis lobby would have you believe, this is a well-researched drug. There are over 10,000 studies into its medicinal properties and we know it contains many useful compounds.</p><img id="i-6ea968ae5b7cd965" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/01/4CD43DA400000578-0-image-m-57_1527899646580.jpg" height="428" width="634" alt="Can cannabis cure cancer? There’s not a shred of evidence to support such a claim, but that doesn’t stop the shrill pro-cannabis lobby from claiming otherwise" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just this week, researchers showed how cannabidiol, which is derived from cannabis, is effective in managing a rare, severe type of epilepsy called Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. And another derivative, dronabinol, is used in treating nausea.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So yes, cannabis — or rather its extracted constituents — have a therapeutic value.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But let’s not forget that it also contains harmful compounds. People who smoke cannabis are at increased risk of lung cancer and chronic respiratory diseases. And there are a host of mental health problems that cannabis is associated with, from anxiety to psychosis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hyping the medical benefits of cannabis — to the point of recklessly claiming a cure for cancer — is just a cynical attempt to push an agenda to decriminalise it for recreational use.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I only wish everyone would be honest about it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Being a teenager is tough.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Baking soda could help fight cancer by making cells easier to target, a study has found.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Drinking the powder dissolved in water could make cells inside a tumour more active and easier for chemotherapy drugs to kill, according to researchers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a tumour grows bigger it cuts off the blood supply of cells inside it, causing them to effectively shut down and hide away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Baking soda, however, could trick them into acting normally and becoming an easier target for chemotherapy drugs, which target active cells.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">US scientists at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research hope their findings could pave the way for a cheap but effective boost for cancer treatment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The concept is so easy,' says study author Chi Van Dang. 'It's not some $100,000 per year drug. It's literally just baking soda.' </p><img id="i-1332f823071d5f55" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/14/4CC8EE5000000578-5791377-image-a-47_1527775146948.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Baking soda, also known as bicarbonate of soda, is widely used in baking but some people use it outside the kitchen as mouthwash or to exfoliate their skin" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The study looked at breast and colon cancer tumours in mice, and showed drinking water with baking soda boosted  cell activity in tumours where there had been less activity before.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Because the cells are more active when baking soda – also known as bicarbonate of soda – is consumed, in theory they are more susceptible to cancer therapies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chemotherapy and immunotherapy may therefore be able to target more of the tumour, including dormant cells which cause the disease to come back.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How baking soda weakens tumours</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ability of baking soda to neutralise acids is key to the success of Dr Van Dang's research.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In solid tumours large numbers of cells have their oxygen supplies cut off – a condition called hypoxia – which causes their pH level to drop and they become acidic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When this happens the cells stop working properly – they stop producing proteins and their metabolism and body clock is disrupted, so they become inactive, or dormant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Cells don't want to make proteins or other biomolecules when they're under stress,' says Dang. 'They want to slow things down and only awaken when things return to normal.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If these dormant cells are cancerous and are not reached by treatment, they may reactivate after the original tumour is removed and make the cancer grow again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However,  baking soda is good at neutralising acid so drinking it could reduce the acidity of a tumour and bring the dormant cells back to life, the study suggests.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Therapy could target hard-to-beat cancer cells </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The findings – published today in the science journal Cell – are important because dormant cells cannot typically be killed by chemotherapy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The <span style="font-size: 16px;">team also found that activation of T cells – a type of white blood cell – which is essential to most immunotherapies, is also reduced by acidity. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Van Dang, scientific director of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research said: 'In tumors grafted into mice, we see [cell] activity in spotty places where there's oxygen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But if you add baking soda to the drinking water given to those mice, the entire tumor lights up with  activity. </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-12758130-64e1-11e8-b9a1-15e54704b386">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">BAKING SODA'S MANY USES</h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">The kitchen staple can be used for:</p></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The prediction would be that by reawakening these cells, you could make the tumor far more sensitive to therapy.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Baking soda has previously been reported to enhance cancer immunotherapy – in which the body's own immune system attacks the tumour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the co-authors of the new study, Robert Gillies of the H.

The international group of researchers, who come from six continents, carried out a major review of evidence before reaching their conclusions.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Lara Keay</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-05-31T01:09:29.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Vaping is highly addictive and a one-way street to smoking</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-05-31T01:09:29.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5785989/Its-never-late-try-Worlds-oldest-man-wants-stop-smoking-aged-114.html" title="It’s never too late to try! ‘World’s oldest man’ wants to stop smoking, aged 114 "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5778473/San-Francisco-mulls-ban-flavored-vaping-liquids-menthols.html" title="Tobacco companies pour £12million into ‘NO’ campaign as San Francisco seeks to BAN all flavored cigarettes and vaping liquids in landmark vote "></link></item><item><title>The roll out of 5G wireless service is 'a massive health experiment,' public health expert warns as cell companies install 800,000 towers across the US</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5784487/The-roll-5G-wireless-service-massive-health-experiment-public-health-expert-warns-a.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 May 2018 22:10:25 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5784487</guid><description><![CDATA[Wireless service providers are rolling out 800,000 cell towers to support the new 5G network, but a University of California, Berkeley public health expert warns the radiation may be dangerous.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Wireless carriers are constructing cell towers a stronger, faster 5G network, but some experts warn that the updated service's health effects are unknown and potentially dangerous.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today, there are 154,000 cell towers in the US, according to wireless communication association, CTIA. By 2026, it estimates another 800,000 will be needed to support 5G. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The network update will bring more Americans into closer proximity with milimeter waves, very short-wave radiation. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Research on cell phone radiation has yielded mixed findings, but some studies have linked older wireless service generations to cancers of the heart and reproductive organs, and 5G's health effects have hardly been studied. </p><img id="i-18cd67f920d4a2df" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/23/4CBD38B800000578-5784487-image-a-21_1527631519860.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Wireless providers have begun installing 800,000 'small cell' towers to support the roll out of the new 5G cellular network, but some public health experts warn they may endanger humans" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new network is slated to support at 100 billion devices, connecting to the internet at anywhere between 10 and 100 times the speeds that information travels through the 4G network. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In order to facilitate these speeds, the new network communicates through millimeter waves (MMWs) rather than microwaves, as previous generations have. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The microwave networks are nearly saturated, hence the switch to the virtually untouched, lower frequency MMWs for 5G. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But smaller waves cannot travel as far, or through as many types of materials. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This means that there will need to be far more individual 'small cell towers' closer together - some have suggested they will be on every street corner in the US.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 5G technology is too new to have been thoroughly tested and studied by many parties outside of cell service providers. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Dr Joel Moskowitz, a public health professor at the University of California, Berkeley, MMWs could pose a very real danger. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The deployment of 5G, or fifth generation cellular technology, constitutes a massive experiment on the health of all species,' he told Daily Mail Online. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> Because MMWs are weaker than microwaves, they are predominantly absorbed by the skin, meaning their distribution is quite focused there,  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Since skin contains capillaries and nerve endings, MMW bio-effects may be transmitted through molecular mechanisms by the skin or through the nervous system,' Dr Moskowitz writes on his blog.     </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also told Daily Mail Online that he's concerned that '5G will use high-band frequencies, or millimeter waves, that may affect the eyes, the testes, the skin, the peripheral nervous system, and sweat glands.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Millimeter waves can also make some pathogens resistant to antibiotics,' he added. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Moskowitz is not alone in aprehensions. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The International Society of Doctors for the Environment, its subsidiaries in 27 countries and more than 200 doctors and scientists are all calling for a stop to be put to the roll out of 5G, 'due to concern that 5G radio frequency radiation will have adverse health effects,' Dr Moskowitz says. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So far, their warnings have gone unheeded.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Verizon began rolling out their 5G small cell towers in 11 cities 2017, and AT&amp;T started installing the new generation of service in Waco and Dallas, Texas, as well as in Atlanta, Georgia this year. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Wireless service providers are rolling out 800,000 cell towers to support the new 5G network, but a University of California, Berkeley public health expert warns the radiation may be dangerous.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Natalie Rahhal</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-05-30T00:21:53.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>The rollout of 5G is 'a massive health experiment,' expert warns</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-05-30T00:21:53.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5757461/Humans-causing-cancer-ANIMALS-surge-plastic-waste-light-pollution-pesticides.html" title="Humans are causing cancer in ANIMALS with a surge in plastic waste, dirty oceans, pesticides and even STREET LAMPS "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5742405/Hawaiis-new-ban-sunscreens-kill-coral-outlawed-effective-sunscreens.html" title="Hawaii¿s new ban on sunscreens that kill coral has outlawed the most effective sunscreens for preventing skin cancer, experts warn "></link></item><item><title>Revealed: What causes cystitis, how to treat it successfully and why 'holding it in' rather than using the loo could trigger a flare-up</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5782089/Why-getting-cystitis-treat-successfully.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 May 2018 11:12:08 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5782089</guid><description><![CDATA[Women's health experts Nina Brochmann and Ellen Støkken Dahl explain why cranberry juice is futile and Ibuprofen may slow recovery, and what you can do to prevent it or ease the pain of cystitis]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Some describe it as peeing on barbed wire. Others feel that passing 'burning knives' or 'flaming arrows' is more accurate. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However you refer to the physical sensation of trying to wee while you have cystitis (trying being the operative word- sometimes only an excruciating drop comes out), it's an ordeal that you probably wouldn't wish on your worst enemy. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Given that at least 50 per cent of women will experience it, it seems especially unjust that treatment options are limited and often reduced to old wives tales.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Interstitial cystitis (long-term pelvic pain combined with issues/ actual torture when peeing) is particularly poorly understood. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now the authors of a new book, Wonder Down Under, aim to counter underwhelming sex education and a lack of research in women’s health and anatomy. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here in a piece for <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="https://www.getthegloss.com/article/why-you-keep-getting-cystitis-and-how-to-treat-it">Get The Gloss</a>, Nina Brochmann and Ellen Støkken Dahl dispel the myths about what works and what doesn't when it comes to cystitis. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From cranberry juice to painkillers to methods of contraception, here's what helps to put out the fire, what could make the flames worse and possible reasons you're cursed with cystitis in the first place. </p><img id="i-75650bbbfbb6733" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/11/4CB94AA700000578-5782089-Treatment_options_for_cystitis_are_limited_and_some_of_them_are_-a-27_1527589606000.jpg" height="350" width="633" alt="Treatment options for cystitis are limited, and some of them are not better than old wives tales" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What is cystitis?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a nutshell, your bladder in a very distressed state. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to the NHS, cystitis is typified by bladder inflammation, usually triggered by a bladder infection. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your bladder can become infected due to bacteria being where it shouldn't (more on that in a moment), and once it's there, causing mild discomfort or sheer agony, depending on how severely you're suffering and how often you get it. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There's a biological reason you get it and your boyfriend/ husband/ brother don't. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Why women get cystitis? </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's pretty much down to anatomy, as Wonder Down Under authors, doctors and women's health experts Nina Brochmann and Ellen Støkken Dahl explain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They say: 'Urinary-tract infections are crappy and as a woman you're particularly prone to them. Our short urethra is to blame. As is the fact that our anus is in close quarters to the urethral opening. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Bacteria from our anus work best if they stay where they belong, but it's difficult to fence bacteria in. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They can easily climb into the urethral opening and move up through it until they have settled on the mucous membranes inside the urethra and bladder. Once there, they cause inflammation.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Male cystitis is possible, but it's rarer and more often an indicator of an underlying condition, so the NHS recommend that men always see their GP if they suspect that they're suffering with cystitis (you can also find more information on UTIs in men on the Patient Info website).</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">You're more prone to cystitis if you:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At this point, what doesn't invite cystitis may seem like a more pertinent question, but if you're in any doubt, here's how to tell if you have it, if the pee sting hasn't given the game away yet…</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="health-ccox"><strong>How to know if you've got c</strong></span></strong><strong><span class="health-ccox"><strong>ystitis</strong></span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tiny knives aside:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's all in all pretty horrible, but that should be your lot for your average case of cystitis, although be on wary of worsening symptoms. Nina and Ellen explain the rarer implications of cystitis:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The vast majority of urinary-tract infections in young women, as many as 95 per cent, are what we call uncomplicated. This simply means that the infection is considered to be less dangerous and requires simple treatment or none at all.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Of course, you should always be alert to any deterioration. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you develop a fever or the pain worsens, especially if it moves up towards your back, you must visit your doctor as soon as possible, at the out-of-hours surgery if need be. </p><mol-permabox id="mol-f53c46d0-6328-11e8-9fae-490708496c50"></mol-permabox><p class="mol-para-with-font">This may be a sign that the bacteria have caused pyelonephritis and there's a risk that you may end up with a messed-up kidney.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By that, they mean that you could be at risk of developing a kidney infection, which can make you feel extremely unwell, or if left untreated, permanent kidney damage. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is rare, but if your cystitis symptoms have progressed to intense pain, fever or you notice blood in your urine, get thee to the doctor's. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Equally, if you're pregnant and have cystitis, don't hesitate to get it checked out by your GP, and if you experience symptoms frequently, you could be suffering with interstitial cystitis. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As above, this punishing condition is somewhat shrouded in mystery, but Nina and Ellen shed a bit of light:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's often necessary to investigate more closely what kind of bacteria are involved, and sometimes checks will be carried out to see if you have an underlying condition that makes it easier for you to become infected. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Having said that, some women get urinary tract infections again and again without our knowing why. It is suspected that these women may have slightly different immune defences in the mucous membranes of their urinary tract, which makes it easier for the bacteria to gain a foothold.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Joy of joys, and at present there's no cure for interstitial cystitis- your GP or specialist will devise a plan of action depending on your individual medical history and any test results, but lifestyle changes are almost always recommended to ease your pain, possibly combined with painkillers, physiotherapy, medication to relax bladder muscles and repair the lining and, as a last resort, surgery, which could involve stretching the bladder, cauterize ulcers or inflamed areas and even using Botox for pain relief. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Be reassured that this type of cystitis is rare, but if you are a sufferer, or know one, you can seek support through the Bladder Health UK charity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How to cope with and treat cystitis</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cystitis and I are familiar bedfellows, in that the dreaded pee knives have left me bedridden on more than one occasion. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One particularly memorable cystitis flashback was when it decided to aggressively come along for a short holiday with my boyfriend and I in Rome. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I'd actually felt the twinges before I left, but like 31 per cent of women, according to a survey of 2000 adults by Pharmacy Outlet, I ignored it, and merrily continued swigging espressos and red wine as my main fluid intake while shunning sleep for more fun activities and trying to hold the sensation of needing a wee (s) while we queued our way around the Vatican. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Boy did I pay for that lax behaviour. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I ended up feverish in my Best Western, with blood in my wee that eventually led to a trip to A&amp;E, where I was leap frogged by nuns in the queue (true story) and then had to mime my issue to the bemused and time pressed nursing staff. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the best part of a day I was duly dispatched with antibiotics after a urine test confirmed the bacterial invasion, plus a list of 'do's and don'ts' in Italian. I speak Spanish and French so roughly deciphered through Latinate similarities that this meant I should avoid coffee, wine, tomatoes, lemons, sweet things and sex. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So basically all of the things you came to Italy to enjoy in the first place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 'do's' corresponded with sensible NHS advice - to recover fully, R&amp;R is essential, as is…</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Take painkillers if you need to, but this is where recent research gets interesting, in a bad way for cystitis sufferers. A recent Norwegian trial involving 383 women diagnosed with cystitis showed that taking ibuprofen delayed recovery compared to antibiotic treatment. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Half of the women involved in the study took ibuprofen, while the other half were given a standard three day course of antibiotics. After four days, 74 per cent of antibiotic takers had made a full recovery, compared to 39 per cent in the ibuprofen group. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Overall, women taking ibuprofen took three days longer to recover, with 46 per cent needing to make a return trip to the GP within a month to treat symptoms that had either gotten worse or recurred, compared to just 10 per cent of those who had taken a course of antibiotics.</p><img id="i-1e1e4a3f598453e6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/11/4CB9546C00000578-5782089-image-a-26_1527589324644.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Studies have not shown that cranberry juice actually helps with the symptoms of cystitis" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Considering the growing danger of antibiotic resistance, GPs and doctors are now increasingly reluctant to prescribe antibiotics for mild cases of cystitis, and more often than not the infection clears up by itself when following the lifestyle guidance above. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Painkillers can help to reduce discomfort, but the study's authors caution that, until cystitis is better understood, ibuprofen in particular (often recommended as it's an anti-inflammatory) can't solve your cystitis woes:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Reducing the use of antibiotics came at the cost of stronger symptom burden, longer duration of symptoms, and more complications.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Until we can identify those women who will develop complications, we cannot recommend ibuprofen alone as initial treatment to women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Researchers point out that following lifestyle advice, taking ibuprofen and having a 'sit it out and see' approach could help to cap antibiotic use, as over 50 per cent of women did see cystitis symptoms clear up without antibiotic treatment, but always make an appointment with your GP if your cystitis doesn't clear up over three days, if symptoms worsen or if they keep returning.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You may also be five liters into the cranberry juice by now, but unfortunately, we've got bad news in that department too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The cranberry juice fable</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If, like me, you may as well have bought shares in Ocean Spray with your cranberry vs. cystitis chugging over the years, you'll be disheartened to hear that new draft guidelines issued at the beginning of this month by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence state that there's not sufficient evidence to recommend cranberry juice as a means of relief from cystitis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Further consultation on the guidelines will close on the 5th of June, so if there are any berry related breakthroughs between then and now we'll let you know, but it's looking unlikely. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That said, Ellen and Nina reassure us that a glass of cranberry juice shouldn't do any harm either:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's a common folk remedy that's been used for centuries, and while it's been indicated that cranberries have no protective effect, if you like cranberry juice there's nothing to stop your trying it, and there are no side-effects.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More recently, taking concentrated aloe vera has been suggested as a means to improve symptoms, reduce pelvic pain and decrease the frequency, urgency and burning sensation of peeing in interstitial cystitis sufferers in particular, although the latest study results were based on a self-reporting survey and further clinical research is required. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Consult your doctor before downing aloe vera juice, but a little every now and again is unlikely to do any harm. H2O is probably just as helpful to flush the bacterial buggers out, however, and at least it costs sweet nothing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>This article was originally published by </strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.getthegloss.com/"><strong>Get The Gloss</strong></a><strong> and reproduced with their permission.</strong></strong></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The 'every two seconds' toilet trips, stinging when you pee and constant fatigue: at least half of women can relate to the limiting symptoms of cystitis. Women's health experts, and authors of Wonder Down Under Nina Brochmann and Ellen Støkken Dahl explain why cranberry juice is futile and Ibuprofen may slow recovery, and what you can do to prevent it or ease the pain of cystitis</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Stephen Matthews</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-05-30T00:20:08.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Why you keep getting cystitis and how to treat it</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-05-30T00:20:08.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5771933/Your-diet-not-genes-controls-body-stores-fat-study-says.html" title="Your diet, not your genes, control how your body stores fat: Food and drink consumed alters chemicals in the gut and influences weight gain, reveals study"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5780413/Hair-raising-treatments-finally-stop-baldness.html" title="The treatments that could finally stop baldness - from 'clones' of your follicles to a 'Miracle Gro' made from chip-pan oil"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5779951/Most-popular-vitamin-mineral-supplements-provide-no-health-benefits-study-finds.html" title="Most popular vitamin and mineral supplements provide no health benefits and could even be increasing your risk of death, study finds"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5780597/Britains-child-obesity-disgrace-Figures-reveal-170-000-leave-primary-school-overweight.html" title="Britain's child obesity disgrace: First official figures reveal 170,000 leave primary school overweight - and 22,000 are dangerously fat "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.getthegloss.com/article/why-you-keep-getting-cystitis-and-how-to-treat-it" title="Why you keep getting cystitis and how to treat it"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.getthegloss.com/" title="Expert Health and Beauty | Get The Gloss"></link></item><item><title>The treatments that could finally stop baldness - from 'clones' of your follicles to a 'Miracle Gro' made from chip-pan oil</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5780413/Hair-raising-treatments-finally-stop-baldness.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 May 2018 21:43:44 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5780413</guid><description><![CDATA[Currently, only two licensed drugs exist for hair loss in the UK, minoxidil and finasteride.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The facts are brutal: almost 40 per cent of men in Britain have lost some or all of their hair.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Baldness is usually due to genes inherited from both parents and triggered when levels of testosterone surge from puberty onwards. These genes shorten the hair’s growing phase — called the anagen phase — and lengthen the period between a hair falling out and a new one starting to grow, known as the telogen phase.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">High levels of testosterone make the problem worse by shrinking the size of hair follicles, the tiny sacs from which hairs sprout.</p><img id="i-a635450f030706a7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/28/21/4CB621B400000578-5780413-image-a-1_1527540200920.jpg" height="634" width="634" alt="Follicle fact: Baldness is usually due to genes inherited from both parents and triggered when levels of testosterone surge from puberty onwards" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It doesn’t just affect men — around eight million women in the UK have some degree of hair loss, usually after the menopause.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Currently, only two licensed drugs exist for hair loss in the UK, minoxidil and finasteride. Minoxidil, an over-the-counter rub-on foam or lotion (sold under the brand name Regaine), works by increasing blood flow to the scalp, nourishing the hair follicles.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It helps about two-thirds of patients, men and women — but can have side-effects ranging from rapid heartbeat to swollen feet and stomach pains. And you have to keep taking it to maintain the effect.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finasteride (Propecia), is available only on private prescription for men. It works by blocking an enzyme that converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), another form of the hormone that triggers baldness.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Research shows finasteride triggers some hair growth in up to 80 per cent of men, but one in 60 experiences impotence — and the risks increase the longer you’re on the drug.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, caffeine-enriched shampoo is a popular over-the-counter remedy. Studies have been small and produced conflicting results, although the latest earlier this year suggests caffeine is at least as effective as minoxidil.</p><img id="i-8fa50fbbe820a118" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/28/21/4C8C1FC800000578-5780413-image-m-18_1527540356297.jpg" height="455" width="634" alt="Prince William: Shockingly, almost 40 per cent of British men have lost some or all of their hair" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">For a study at Mumbai Municipal General Hospital in India, 210 men washed their hair with caffeine shampoo for six months and for the following six months used minoxidil every day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The results, published in Skin Pharmacology and Physiology, showed both treatments triggered an 11 per cent improvement in the time hair spent growing rather than resting. The theory is that, like finasteride, caffeine blocks the effects of DHT.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another treatment is platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy.

A UK company, called HairClone, is being set up to allow users to deposit a hair sample that can be frozen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the 30-minute procedure, around 50 hair follicles are harvested from an area the size of a 1p piece by a surgeon under local anaesthetic. The follicles are then cryopreserved — stored in liquid nitrogen — until the patient needs them. Some can then be thawed and specific cells involved in the production of the hair will be isolated before being cultivated in the lab for two to three weeks, where they multiply.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The cells will then be injected back into the scalp to hopefully produce new follicles.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">AVAILABLE IN: 2-3 YEARS</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="health-ccox">THE CHIP PAN OIL REMEDY</span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Earlier this year, researchers found that a chemical widely used in frying oil stimulated hair growth in mice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Called dimethylpolysiloxane, it’s a type of silicone oil used by the food industry.

It’s thought to work by ‘tricking’ the body into thinking there is a shortage of oxygen in the affected area, so that the brain sends out an instruction for oxygen-rich blood to be increased so damage can be repaired.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In February, researchers at Tanta University in Egypt tested it on 80 men and women with hair loss. Half had the gas jabs and the rest a dummy version.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The results, in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, showed that three months later, hair density improved significantly in those given the gas jabs but not those on the placebo.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Carboxytherapy can have side-effects such as swelling around the site of injection, bruising and pain.

Baldness is usually due to genes inherited from both parents and triggered when levels of testosterone surge from puberty onwards. These genes shorten the hair’s growing phase — called the anagen phase — and lengthen the period between a hair falling out and a new one starting to grow, known as the telogen phase. High levels of testosterone make the problem worse by shrinking the size of hair follicles, the tiny sacs from which hairs sprout.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Peter Lloyd</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-05-29T07:08:37.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Hair-raising treatments that could finally stop baldness</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-05-29T07:08:37.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5772393/Behind-scenes-25-year-old-womans-groundbreaking-brain-surgery.html" title="EXCLUSIVE - Inside the operating theater where 3D TV is revolutionizing brain surgery: Rare glimpse at operation to remove an olive-sized blood clot that caused woman's shock seizure"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5779325/Beauty-queen-undergoes-ground-breaking-surgery-gives-50-electric-shocks-DAY.html" title="Beauty queen, 21, is given 50 electric shocks a DAY from two implants in her chest and brain to stop her from having an epileptic fit"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5777727/Yes-die-broken-heart.html" title="Yes, you CAN die of a broken heart and women are twice as vulnerable as men: Cardiac surgeon reveals how our hearts govern our emotions"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5772463/Cancer-sufferer-describes-15-milk-donors-helped-feed-baby-girl.html" title="'I couldn't give her what she needed... but these women stepped in': Cancer sufferer describes how 15 milk donors across the US helped her feed her baby girl after a double mastectomy "></link></item><item><title>Most popular vitamin and mineral supplements provide no health benefits and could even be increasing your risk of death, study finds</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5779951/Most-popular-vitamin-mineral-supplements-provide-no-health-benefits-study-finds.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 May 2018 18:00:20 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5779951</guid><description><![CDATA[A new study has found that most vitamin and mineral supplements do not provide any health benefits nor help prevent cardiovascular disease, heart attacks, strokes or premature death.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

You could just give people a probiotic capsule but yoghurt has added protein and calcium, amongst other things — and it comes with the pleasure of eating, which means people are more likely to have it.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what is it that makes yoghurt beneficial — and are all yoghurts equal?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>IT’S ESPECIALLY GOOD FOR WOMEN</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Certain groups at higher risk of osteoporosis — such as post-menopausal women, teenage girls and pregnant women — need yoghurt more regularly as it is one of the richest sources of the nutrients these groups tend to lack, says Ibolya Olah, a dietitian based in London.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In particular, yoghurt contains a significant level of iodine, essential for the production of thyroid hormones; women can lack iodine because they tend to avoid dairy, wrongly thinking it’s unhealthy and fattening.</p><img id="i-a2168f3d59000572" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/22/4C6F950A00000578-5755199-image-a-49_1526939954012.jpg" height="357" width="634" alt="Healthy: Yoghurt contains a significant level of iodine, essential for the production of thyroid hormones - which women can lack  because they tend to avoid fatty dairy" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">A 150g serving (roughly a small pot) of plain yoghurt provides around a third of our daily iodine and bone-building calcium, and nearly 15 per cent of our daily protein, similar to a boiled egg.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yoghurt also provides 30 per cent of our daily phosphorus, needed for healthy bones and teeth and around a fifth of our recommended amount of vitamin B12 (to release energy from food) and potassium (for healthy blood pressure).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>YOGHURT’S SECRET WEAPON</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s thought that yoghurt was discovered by accident in around 5,000 BC. With the domestication of milk-producing animals, herdsmen would store the milk in bags made of gut tissue after they found it caused milk to curdle and preserved it for longer. The word yoghurt is thought to come from the Turkish yogurmak, which means to thicken or curdle. It’s this curdling that makes yoghurt so useful.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Yoghurt is unique because it brings the benefits of dairy in general together with its own,’ says Ditte Hobbs, a post-doctoral research fellow in human nutrition at the University of Reading.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What sets it apart is the fact that it’s been fermented and contains bacteria. Most milks and cheeses are pasteurised by heating to 72c, which kills off a lot of the bacteria, good and bad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yoghurts are made by fermenting milk with two bacteria called Streptoccus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, which produces an acid that preserves the yoghurt and kills off harmful bacteria such as Salmonella.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The fermentation also produces good bacteria called probiotics, which contribute to our gut health, and prebiotics, which feed the good bacteria and help them thrive, says Dr Cunliffe. This community of bugs — which he calls ‘the beast inside us’ — affects all our body systems. The protein in yoghurt has a protective effect on bacteria, helping it pass through the stomach into the colon where it’s needed, explains Alan Mackie, a professor of colloid chemistry at the University of Leeds.</p><img id="i-ac0b40867d1d2c28" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/22/4C4062DA00000578-5755199-image-a-48_1526939863578.jpg" height="413" width="634" alt="Did you know? A major analysis in 2014 found higher intake of yoghurt was associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the systems the bacteria in yoghurt may help is immunity. ‘There’s evidence that yoghurt will protect us from infections as the gut lining, packed with bacteria from the yoghurt, works like a primer for the immune system and keeps it on its toes ready to fight off infection,’ says Dr Cunliffe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Probiotics can also fight specific bacterial infections such as C.difficile, Salmonella and H. pylori (which can lead to stomach ulcers), adds Professor Whorwell. ‘If you want to lower the risk of infections such as these, have a yoghurt a day and keep your immune system ready to fight them off.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As well as the bacteria produced by fermentation, some commercial yoghurts have extra bacteria added — these are usually displayed on the label. For example, many contain Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus acidophilus strains.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Some of these microbes produce acids that kill undesirable bugs while others produce healthy compounds that help begin digestion and so make nutrients available for the body to use,’ explains Paul Cotter, a molecular microbiologist at APC Microbiome Institute in Ireland (who has one natural yoghurt or kefir — a fermented milk drink — a day).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>KEEPS YOUR HEART HEALTHY </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Saturated fat is thought to be a bad thing, contributing to our risk of heart disease.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But in the case of fat in yoghurt, it seems to have the opposite effect. There is evidence that the type of saturated fat we get in dairy might be good for the heart, says Maeve Hanan, a dietitian from dieteticalyspeaking.com (who eats a pot of natural yoghurt topped with fresh fruit twice a day to boost her nutrient intake).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Yoghurts that are high in saturated fat seem to be the most beneficial,’ agrees Dr Hobbs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Saturated fat doesn’t seem to have a detrimental effect when we get it from yoghurts. When we look at data from people who consume large amounts of dairy (apart from butter) they seem to have no increased risk of heart disease despite high saturated fat levels.</p><img id="i-291c0add17fce185" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/23/4C405FB600000578-5755199-image-m-51_1526941368115.jpg" height="638" width="634" alt="Good food: Yoghurt — even the high-fat variety — is not that fattening, say experts.

A study last year by Boston University School of Medicine found that women who consumed five or more servings of yoghurt a week had a 20 per cent lower risk of developing high blood pressure than women who hardly ate it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile a major analysis in 2014 found higher intake of yoghurt was associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes — other dairy foods did not seem to have this effect, reported the journal BioMed Central Medicine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Researchers said a daily serving of 244g yoghurt — one large pot —reduces the relative risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 18 per cent. These were all epidemiological studies (an analysis based on data from large groups of people to identify trends) so could only identify an association and not that yoghurt directly causes these benefits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But what is it about yoghurt that might lead to such benefits? One theory is that it’s due to what’s called the food matrix — the combination of nutrients and the interaction between the different compounds within a food.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Dairy has other nutrients that could be working together when we eat them — so as a whole product they seem to reduce the negative impact of saturated fat,’ says Dr Hobbs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yoghurt also contains compounds called lactotripeptides, tiny protein-like substances, which are a by-product when the yoghurt is fermented.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The latest research suggests that lactotripeptides have an effect on mechanisms that control blood pressure, says Dr Hobbs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Lactotripeptides reduce the action of an enzyme which in turn stops arteries constricting so much, and this helps reduce blood pressure and reduce our risk of developing complications from high blood pressure, such as stroke,’ she adds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘They have even been found to be involved in controlling insulin sensitivity — which, when disrupted can be a precursor to diabetes, which could explain why eating yoghurt regularly reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes,’ she adds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A trial by the University of Reading published in March found children who ate more than 60g of yoghurt a day had lower pulse pressure (a measure of how stiff the arteries are) and better-controlled blood sugar levels than children who didn’t. ‘Children who ate yoghurt daily were essentially at lower risk of heart disease and of diabetes later in life,’ says Dr Hobbs, who led the study.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A 2015 study even found probiotic yoghurts can help relieve hayfever. Researchers at University School of Medicine in Nashville, U.S. reviewed 23 studies involving more than 1,900 people and found that probiotic yoghurts or supplements improved quality of life of hayfever sufferers, compared to a placebo. Scientists have suggested allergies may be caused by a lack of bacteria in the gut, although much more research is needed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s good for bones too: in a study of over-60s last year by Trinity College Dublin, researchers analysed health records of more than 5,000 people and found that eating more yoghurt was associated with a higher hip bone density — an indicator of stronger bones — and a significantly reduced risk of osteoporosis, which leads to a reduction in bone strength and an increased risk of fractures. More studies are needed to understand how and why.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>AND IT’S SLIMMING, TOO!</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yoghurt — even the high-fat variety — is not that fattening, say experts. In terms of calories, it’s comparable to a couple of slices of bread. Furthermore, a review published by the International Journal of Obesity in 2016 found yoghurt consumption was linked with lower BMI, lower body weight, smaller waists and lower body fat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Researchers from the University of York and other centres analysed 22 studies into the effect of yoghurt on weight and found that in general the ‘addition of yoghurt to the daily diet may facilitate significant loss of body fat’ — although more studies were needed to understand the mechanisms.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox health floatRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-4e8fc5f0-5d42-11e8-9d2e-2da641bbdf09">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">HEALTHIEST OF ALL?

You can use a little of the yoghurt as the starter culture for your next batch.</p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">One theory is that yoghurt is high in protein which has a satiating effect. It may also affect levels of hormones which reduce our appetite. Greek yoghurt is particularly filling as it contains more protein than other types. That’s because it’s strained, making it more concentrated so it will keep you feeling fuller for longer, says Priya Tew, a dietitian in Southampton.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Greek yoghurt is strained to remove much of the lactose (milk sugar) and whey (the liquid remaining after the milk is curdled). This gives it a creamier, thicker consistency and in many cases provides twice as much protein, with less sugar — albeit slightly more caloriies. For example, 100g of Fage Total Greek yoghurt contains 93 calories, 3g saturated fat, 3.8g sugar, and 9g protein, compared to Yeo Valley organic natural yoghurt which has 82 calories, 2.9g saturated fat, 5.6g sugar and 5.1g protein.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other good choices include M&amp;S Low Fat Natural Yoghurt ((150g, 55p); The Collective Straight Up unsweetened live yoghurt (150g, 79p, most supermarkets); and Waitrose Greek Natural Strained Yoghurt (200g, 99p). Note, Greek-style yoghurt hasn’t been strained so doesn’t have extra protein. There is another reason not to go for low-fat — often these have added sugar to replace flavour and consistency lost by removing fat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>HOW ABOUT PROBIOTIC SHOTS?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A natural yoghurt with a selection of added bacteria would be better than a single probiotic shot, says Dr Cunliffe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That’s because it is a combination of bacteria that’s important and a single strain wouldn’t have much effect, explains Professor Mackie.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Professor Whorwell doesn’t agree. ‘The idea that the more diverse our microbiome the better it is for health is speculative,’ he says, referring to studies he’s worked on where a single-strain yoghurt drink did have an effect (these studies were industry funded).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The hope is, he says, is that ‘eventually we will be able to take a stool sample from anyone with a complaint and analyse its contents to show what bacteria are missing in that person. We can use this to develop a “designer yoghurt” which contains the bacteria that each person needs.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The best benefits we can get from modulating our gut health come from multi-strain yoghurt — plain with added live bacteria,’ argues Dr Cunliffe. He points out that many yoghurts won’t call themselves ‘probiotic’ as companies cannot do so without a specific study, but all yoghurts will, by definition, contain beneficial bacteria, even sugary ones. ‘If you consume these good bugs regularly, they will live inside you and out-compete bad bugs in your colon,’ he says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there is no doubt that despite the potential health benefits, some commercial yoghurts are so sugary they effectively count as a pudding, and should be regarded as an occasional treat, say experts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a rule, in 100g of yoghurt, the first 5g of sugar listed is lactose, found naturally in milk. It doesn’t contribute to our daily limit of ‘bad’ sugar. ‘Anything above 5 to 6g sugar per 100g I would treat as a dessert, says Ibolya Olah.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-ddd23b40-5d41-11e8-9d2e-2da641bbdf09">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">YOGHURTS TO TRY...AND  AVOID</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>YEO VALLEY NATURAL YOGHURT</strong></p><img id="i-10c2c8f9631b0c70" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/22/4C821BD900000578-5755199-image-a-2_1526938818115.jpg" height="284" width="284" alt="Silky texture and pleasantly tangy" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">150g, 65p, most supermarkets.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Half a century after the 'sexual revolution' of the 1960s, men still orgasm almost three times as much as women.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just over 90 percent of men orgasm every time they have sex, compared to around a third of women, new research has found.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That figure plummets in the case of casual sex: just four percent of women climax every time, as opposed to 55 percent of men (or rather, it's 13 times more likely for males than females).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And yet, when masturbating or engaging in lesbian sex, 95 percent of women easily reach an orgasm - in an average time of four minutes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once again, author Dr Laurie Mintz declares, it boils down to our near-global misunderstanding of how female pleasure differs from males - focusing intently on penetration, as clitoral stimulation remains something of a mysterious art.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Porn has been scapegoated for this, but that is only half the story, warns Dr Mintz, a psychology professor, human sexuality expert and author of Becoming Cliterate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To truly come close to closing the gap, she says, America should take a leaf out of the Netherlands' book, by factoring cliteral stimulation into schools' education programs.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Until that (unlikely) turn of events happens, she is embarking on as many studies as possible to quantify the problem - and sharing tips based on her research to help men help women reach that elusive sweet spot. </p><img id="i-501eaa88aecab27d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/16/19/4C546D3E00000578-5736837-image-a-1_1526493777124.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The vast majority of men climax through sex most of the time, while just a third of women do" class="blkBorder img-share" /><video preload="none" id="1281152327001" title="MRI scans show woman's brain fully activating during orgasm" poster="http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/prod/1418450360/1418450360_1281341937001_vs-1281189675001.jpg">

  </video><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>THE NEW RESEARCH </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Mintz routinely polls her students at the University of Florida and elsewhere to gauge their views on sex and their sexual experiences.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The findings have made waves in the field of sexuality research, and led to her writing Becoming Cliterate: Why Orgasm Equality Matters – And How to Get It.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In one research paper involving college students, she found 91 percent of males usually orgasmed, compared to 39 percent of females, during sex.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another showed that, in a casual context, 55 percent of men and four percent of women 'usually or regularly' orgasm from 'sexual encounters'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The orgasm gap isn't limited to student,' Dr Mintz warns in a recent article for <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://theconversation.com/the-orgasm-gap-picking-up-where-the-sexual-revolution-left-off-96178">The Conversation</a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Among a nationally representative US sample, 64 percent of women and 91 percent of men said they'd orgasmed at their most recent sexual encounter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Clearly, there's an orgasm gap.'</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>REASONS FOR THE GAP</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1. Poor sex education</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As Girls &amp; Sex author Peggy Orenstein puts it, porn has become the 'new sex ed' for young people.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's understandable: in the US, fewer than half of schools are required to teach sex ed. Three-quarters of high schools and half of middle schools teach abstinence only, and just 60 percent teach about birth control. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The primary focus is on internal organs and hormones, with little to no mention of the clitoris. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We also do not educate people on the clitoris, which means that there's a real 'PR problem', if you will, for the clitoris,' explains Alex Fine, CEO of Dame Products, a new sex toy brand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Eighty percent of women need clitoral stimulation in order to orgasm. With penetrative sex alone, it's very difficult to achieve this type of clitoral stimulation. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'[But] it doesn't have enough exposure to be fully understood, which means that unfortunately, with partnered sex, it tends to get ignored — leading to a pleasure gap.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, Dr Mintz points out<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://theconversation.com/the-orgasm-gap-picking-up-where-the-sexual-revolution-left-off-96178"></a>, '60 percent of college students falsely believe the clitoris is located inside the vaginal canal.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. Porn</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'One false image portrayed in porn, and mainstream media, is that it is normal, indeed ideal, for women to orgasm from intercourse,' Dr Mintz warns<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://theconversation.com/the-orgasm-gap-picking-up-where-the-sexual-revolution-left-off-96178"></a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This false belief is a main culprit in women not getting the stimulation they need to orgasm.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. Cultural myths</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Researchers in one study found that young adults believe that in casual sex, women's pleasure is less important than men's pleasure,' Dr Mintz said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They concluded that while it is now acceptable for women to engage in casual sex, it is not acceptable for them to seek sexual pleasure outside of a relationship.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>WAYS TO CLOSE THE PLEASURE GAP</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-underline"><span class="mol-style-large">Couples:</span></span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1. Embrace mutual masturbation</strong><span class="mol-style-italic"><strong> </strong></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'A lot of the sex that gay people have is mutual masturbation, which a lot of straight people — guys in particular — don't think counts as sex, or is some sort of tragic consolation prize,' Dan Savage, a sex columnist who hosts the <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.savagelovecast.com/">Savage Lovecast</a>, told <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://mashable.com/2018/05/07/mutual-masturbation-orgasm-gap/#kAQh3Bp6zOql">Mashable</a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If straight people approach mutual masturbation as a rich and rewarding form of sexual expression it would improve their sex lives so much,' says Savage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. Discuss it</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While Fine is a huge proponent of sex toys to explore sexuality and pleasure, she urges readers communication is the most important baseline.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Exploring different things with your partner and having open and honest conversations about what feels good increases everyone's pleasure,' Fine explains. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Not having these conversations with your partner can mean that you don't have a chance to speak up about what feels good (and what doesn't) - leading to miscommunication and less than satisfactory sex.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. Try using toys</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The sex toy market is booming. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Leading the surge are brands that focus, for the first time, on female pleasure and aesthetics, as opposed to products modeled on styles the fit porn for heterosexual men.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dame is one of those brands, producing dinky and sleek vibrators. Their products are for women and for couples (including a 'wearable' for couples' play). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Pressure, weight, vibrations - these are all things to experiment with to see what works best,' Fine says.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Our toys are designed for couple play (but can also be used solo!), which help with this transition from solo to couple play.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-underline"><span class="mol-style-large">Heterosexual women:</span></span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1. Me time - and, again, embrace toys</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While the onus is not all on women to close the gap, women can</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Women also have to be able to let go of body-image self-consciousness and in sex,' Mintz <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/stress-and-sex/201510/the-orgasm-gap-simple-truth-sexual-solutions">says</a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They have to feel entitled to pleasure, know what brings them pleasure (often through on their own to find out), and be able communicate this to their partners and these partners have to want to use this information.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To do this, Fine says, masturbation and experimenting with toys is key.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Experimenting to see if you might like something,' she says, 'leads to a better overall sexual experience.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. Don't be shy about speaking up </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You know your body best so speaking up when things feel good, asking for things that you know you like,' Fine says. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If you know you feel amazing with clitoral stimulation, make it happen! Whether it's you or your partner doing it — or a combination of both — we want to empower people to really own what feels good for them.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-underline"><span class="mol-style-large">Heterosexual men:</span></span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1. Ask questions</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The number one rule is to listen, Fine says. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Show up! Be present and open for your partner - that goes for everyone. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'People of all genders and sexual identities deserve open communication in the bedroom.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Realize there is no 'normal', ask questions (this is important!), and really listen to what is working for them and what isn't.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kate McCoombs, a sex educator based in New York, concurs. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Some guys just don't make the effort to make sure their partners are having as much fun as they are,' McCombs told <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://mic.com/articles/141670/this-is-the-number-you-should-try-keeping-in-mind-during-your-sexual-encounters#.bbX4eP4B7">Mic</a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They might ask, 'Did you come yet?' but won't meaningfully offer to correct the imbalance.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="mol-style-underline"><span class="mol-style-large">Society:</span></span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1. Improve sex ed</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Mintz calls for a sexual education model more akin to that taught in Holland.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Information on pleasure, masturbation, the clitoris and orgasm is taught in commonly used sex education programs in Dutch schools,' Dr Mintz said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So is information on abstinence, birth control, consent, communication, sexual decision-making, and the difference between porn and real sex.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Data suggest it works, she explains: 'The Dutch have lower pregnancy and STI rates.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>CLOSING THE GAP 'COULD REDUCE RATES OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE'</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Dr Mintz, research shows that places with better sexual education focusing on women have lower rates of sexual assault and rape than their counterparts. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The Dutch have...three times less sexual violence than the US,' she explains, saying she believes their female-pleasure-inclusive sex ed programs are a driving factor.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She quotes a writer who laid bare the inextricably connection between pleasure and violence: 'Let 2018 be the year we demand more than freedom from sexual harassment and abuse. This year, it's time we demand pleasure.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Time magazine said the #MeToo movement was simmering for years. It seems that a related sexual revolution for pleasure equality is also emerging,' Dr Mintz concludes. </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Porn has been scapegoated for the orgasm gap, but that is only half the story, warns Dr Laurie Mintz, a psychology professor, sexuality expert and Becoming Cliterate author.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Mia DeGraaf</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-05-17T22:30:25.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>What IS the secret to the female orgasm?</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-05-17T22:30:25.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5738207/Samantha-X-details-WORST-sexual-encounter-wasnt-paying-client.html" title="'He was a very, very handsome young boy': Samantha X details her WORST sexual encounter - and he wasn't a paying client"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5736031/Low-libido-medical-expert-provides-8-reasons-not-want-sex.html" title="Low libido?

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But despite his best efforts, he found himself worrying constantly about his death, and he spent sleepless nights imagining different, horrific scenarios. ‘The mode of death that worried me most was the tumour invading a major vessel, causing unstoppable bleeding into my lungs, drowning in the blood.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He realised he could only focus on living well now if he faced the fear of dying upfront. ‘I cannot, of course, predict how I might die,’ he said. ‘But I started thinking that I could focus on living well if I knew I would be able to have some control at the time I need it.’ Six months since his diagnosis, he is sure of one thing: we need to be much more open about how we help each other to die well, and what we mean by that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It seems we have created a climate in which the prevalent belief is that pain and death are avoidable and wrong.

  </video><p class="mol-para-with-font">The end of life was something former Labour cabinet minister, Tessa Jowell, who died on Saturday aged 70, had spoken about after being diagnosed with brain cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘In the end, what gives a life meaning is not only how it is lived, but how it draws to a close,’ she said in a speech to the House of Lords.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Her daughter, Jess, told Radio 4 yesterday that Tessa’s peaceful death had been ‘beautiful’, adding: ‘To the last moment, she was the most magnificent person and mother we all know and adore.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tessa’s daughter-in-law, Ella Mills, revealed that Tessa died in the arms of her husband, David, and grown-up children, Matt and Jess.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sadly, not everyone dies in a familiar place surrounded by loved ones. People die in emergency rooms and intensive care units, where the machinery of life preservation creates a chasm loved ones feel they cannot cross. On wards where staff are focused on cure, sensitive palliative care can be overlooked.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While we are able to openly discuss birth and loss, few of us know what to expect as death approaches: it makes families anxious, and creates fear and uncertainty for the dying.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">New research by the charity Sue Ryder suggests we would like to know more about death and dying, but we don’t know whom or what to ask. A survey of 1,000 bereaved adults in the UK found that some of the main worries people have when someone close to them is dying is not knowing the physical and mental changes to expect as death draws near, or how to make loved ones more comfortable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The findings have prompted the charity to call for a ‘national conversation’ and greater openness between health and care professionals and families about what to expect.</p><img id="i-3211ae7ad03ba25b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/14/22/4C29B27100000578-5728451-image-a-29_1526332147293.jpg" height="634" width="634" alt="Loving portrait: Ms Jowell with her family, who were present throughout her terminal illness" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There’s a specific need for more information and communication about the physical and mental signs that indicate death is near,’ says Heidi Travis, chief executive of Sue Ryder.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘This would help to prepare families with different ways they might respond and comfort their loved one. It could also prompt discussions about their last wishes and different ways to help them have a good death.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Doctors and nurses who are trained to heal may unconsciously collude in this fear about the moment of death; working to prolong life, they may not always recognise the need to support their patient to die.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Barry Ward, 85, a retired golf writer, from Oakham in Rutland, found the experience of the death of his wife, Christine, so traumatic, that three years later he still struggles to talk about it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘She was the love of my life,’ he says. ‘From the night we met, we knew it would be for ever. Our marriage was filled with love.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In April 2014, Christine, a care home administrator, then 68, was diagnosed with a brain tumour which was treated successfully with chemotherapy. But shortly afterwards, she developed a rare gut infection which caused internal bleeding and was admitted to intensive care on Christmas Day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘On January 12, 2015, a young doctor took me to one side and told me there was nothing more they could do for her,’ says Barry.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But the following day, amazingly, she began to show signs of recovery. The day after that, her heart rate and blood pressure were better and she was no longer at death’s door. On January 15 she was better still, and on the 16th, she was sitting up in bed smiling, and talking about physiotherapy. Can you imagine my relief and joy?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, Christine was dying, but had been given a new drug which had slowed her internal bleeding. However, Barry wasn’t aware that the improvement would be only temporary.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He spent January 17 at Christine’s bedside making plans for their 41st wedding anniversary.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At about 7pm, he drove home but had just sat down when the phone rang. ‘I was told to come back quickly: I found her unconscious, ghostly white and with her mouth agape.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At 2am on January 18, Christine died. ‘The shock, when she’d been so well hours before, was appalling, and it has affected my ability to grieve,’ says Barry.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I wasn’t prepared for the end, and I don’t think she was either. I would have liked the chance to say goodbye.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Half of all deaths in England occur in hospitals — and 50 per cent of all hospital complaints relate to end-of-life care, according to 2008 figures.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many people die without them or their family knowing the end is coming. Death is often seen as a failure of treatment, and this can mean missing out on preparations for a good death.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Debbie Riordan’s parents, Wendy, 76, a hairdresser and Rodger, 78, a pharmaceutical salesman, died in 2015 within four months of each other. Wendy had undergone successful chemotherapy for bowel cancer when she developed an infection, and Rodger died from lymphoma, 18 months after he was diagnosed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Mum had terrible sickness, so it was quite upsetting, but we were sure she would make a full recovery,’ says Debbie, a yoga instructor from Coventry.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There were moments when Mum would say: “I’ve never felt this ill; I know I’m not going to make it.” ’ Debbie recalls. ‘But the nursing staff batted her concerns away. So we’d say: “Don’t worry Mum, it’s just a bad day.”</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But over a period of two weeks, she got worse and worse.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The medical team must have known she was dying, says Debbie, ‘yet no one ever said: “She really is poorly; now is the time to say what you need to say.” ’</p><img id="i-a5687c772aaa57fe" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/14/22/0EC29DF900000514-5728451-image-a-28_1526332108266.jpg" height="819" width="634" alt="‘In the end, what gives a life meaning is not only how it is lived, but how it draws to a close,’ Jowell recently said in a speech to the House of Lords" class="blkBorder img-share" /><video preload="none" id="7638901082598454186" title="Theresa May pays tribute to Dame Tessa Jowell following her death" poster="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/05/14/18/2018/05/14/17/video-2959414-931_636x358.jpg">

  </video><p class="mol-para-with-font">By chance, Debbie had heard palliative care consultant and author Kathryn Mannix talking on Radio 4 about the signs that someone is dying: ‘I could see Mum was at that point,’ she says. ‘She wasn’t eating, she didn’t want to drink, she was unconscious a lot of the time, and her body was filling up with fluid.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We asked the nurses to stop clearing her airways and doing blood tests, but the focus was still on treatment, not how to spend the time she had left.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Debbie feels that as a result of hearing Dr Mannix, she was lucky she was able to have precious last conversations with both her parents. Fortuitously, she was there when her mother died, but missed the moment of her father’s death.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She feels it would have been helpful if, instead of ordering more tests, doctors had asked gentle questions such as: ‘How do you think your mum is?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘That would have helped us realise sooner what was happening,’ Debbie says. Her dad died early one morning when she and her sister had gone home. ‘If we’d known how close he was to death, we would have stayed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I think doctors and nurses are frightened to initiate a conversation about death for fear of upsetting people. But you’ll never have another chance to tell someone how much you love them or say goodbye.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Mannix, who has spent the past ten years leading a palliative care team at the Newcastle Hospitals NHS Trust, says that when a patient is ‘mortally sick, but saveable, it is absolutely right that everything should be done to treat them’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She adds: ‘Intensive care medicine buys time, so dying is delayed long enough for healing to take place. But intensive care doctors are not always comfortable with difficult conversations and that’s where we come in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I encourage acute care teams to acknowledge that while recovery is hoped for, death is possible, and to let us work alongside them.’</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-0eeab400-57c0-11e8-8638-53e75359d566">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"><span class="health-ccox"> People think it’s going to involve blood and guts and gore. Yet normal dying is incredibly peaceful and gentle. Most people experience longer and longer periods of unconsciousness when they’ll think they’ve been asleep.

We need to ask whether this is the end of the line for this patient and should we be having those difficult conversations about what needs to happen next.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not all hospitals have palliative care consultants, but all staff should be trained in end-of-life care. A palliative care consultant might ask: ‘Have the doctors explained things so you understand what’s happening?’ And: ‘What do you fear the most?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The family is often doing everything to avoid the conversation going to “the worst place” in case it gets emotionally horrible,’ says Dr Mannix. ‘But actually it becomes a lot calmer once you start asking: “If she’s so sick she cannot be saved, what sort of things should we be doing now so we don’t regret anything?”</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I don’t want them to wish in two weeks’ time, when they are suffering agonising grief, that they’d had that conversation at the deathbed.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sue Ryder’s advice on what to expect when death is near was in the top three most viewed pages on their website in 2017, which suggests that as a society we have become so protected from death, we don’t know what normal dying looks like.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This finding resonates with Elise Hoadley, a palliative care nurse for 25 years and now director of Leckhampton Court Hospice in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She has spent her entire professional life looking after the dying. ‘I have witnessed countless families facing the death of a loved one, not knowing what to expect,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘People think it’s going to involve blood and guts and gore. Yet normal dying is incredibly peaceful and gentle. Most people experience longer and longer periods of unconsciousness when they’ll think they’ve been asleep. Breathing becomes shallower, and eventually fades until it finally stops altogether.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But if people are terrified of the physical unknowns, we’re even more frightened of all the emotions that go with death.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Patients sometimes don’t want to talk about their own death because they don’t want to upset their loved ones. And loved ones don’t want to talk to the dying person about it for fear of upsetting them,’ says Elise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘If we can facilitate the conversation, an element of honesty comes in and everything is less traumatic for the family and patient.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When your loved one is dying in hospital, you can ask for the palliative care team to be involved. If they are not available, Kathryn Mannix suggests asking the question: Is there someone I can talk to who can explain what is happening?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The more patients know, the better they can plan the end,’ agrees Elise Hoadley.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘A rule of thumb in palliative care is that if a patient gradually declines over months, they will usually have months to live; if it’s weeks, they’ll have weeks, and if you see a decline over a period of days or hours, then death is usually only days or hours away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘How wonderful would it be if more people knew that? Because then they could really plan how, and where, they want to die.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Mannix says deathbed patterns repeat over and over again: ‘The two things people want to say are, “I love you” and, “thank you”. Don’t wait for the last day of someone’s life to say either — say it now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The two biggest regrets people have are not saying, “I’m sorry” and, “I forgive you”. Those are difficult things to express, but deathbeds give you permission to have conversations that don’t happen at any other time.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>For further information and advice for families on what to expect go to sueryder.org/facingloss</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic"><strong>With The End In Mind: Dying, Death And Wisdom In An Age Of Denial by Kathryn Mannix is published by William Collins, price £16.99.</strong></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>New research by the charity Sue Ryder suggests we would like to know more about death and dying, but we don’t know whom or what to ask. A survey of 1,000 bereaved adults in the UK found that some of the main worries people have when someone close to them is dying is not knowing the physical and mental changes to expect as death draws near, or how to make loved ones more comfortable. The findings have prompted the charity to call for a ‘national conversation’ and greater openness between health and care professionals and families about what to expect. Here are some remarkable stories of such transparency.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Peter Lloyd</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-05-15T08:49:33.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>We all deserve a good death</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-05-15T08:49:33.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5725797/Grieving-mother-warns-silent-killer-heart-disease-took-17-year-old-daughters-life.html" title="Beautiful 17-year-old girl who dreamed of becoming a forensic scientist lost her fight for life, weeks after she started preparing for university, after her family mistook the signs of her killer disease for teenage tiredness"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5727349/Dying-mother-pens-heartbreaking-letter-insurer-refused-life-saving-liver.html" title="Dying mother pens a heartbreaking letter to her insurer after being refused a life-saving liver to fix the damage of botched cancer surgery that left a fist-sized hole in her organ "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5727695/Avoiding-midnight-snack-early-breakfast-key-staying-slim.html" title="Avoiding a midnight snack and early breakfast is the key to staying slim: Scientists reveal eating ONLY within a 12-hour window helps keep the weight off"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5726271/Plague-toxic-caterpillars-removed-Norfolk-cliffs.html" title="Thousands of toxic caterpillars are to be removed from Norfolk cliffs: Oak moths that cause deadly asthma attacks, rashes and even blindness have been spotted on coastal paths"></link></item><item><title>A herpes vaccine could be available in 5 years, claim scientists after they protect monkeys from catching the incurable sexually transmitted disease (and it could also protect against cold sores)</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5709553/Tremendous-potential-herpes-vaccine-protects-animals-catching-common-virus.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 May 2018 11:05:24 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5709553</guid><description><![CDATA[Universities in Louisiana and Pennsylvania have developed vaccines that stop monkeys and guinea pigs developing symptoms after being exposed to aggressive forms of the genital herpes virus.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

I’ve created a diet that features three different options depending on whether your goal is to shape up and lose a few inches, shift a stone, or shed twice that.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s the classic 5:2, the very fast 5:2 (in which calories are restricted to 800 daily), and finally the simple Mediterranean approach designed to supercharge your health.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To help those embarking on the 5:2 diets, we’ve created some delicious 800-calorie menus: use these and you can expect to lose up to a stone by July.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For everyone else (and for non-fasting days), we’ve suggested healthy additions to the low calorie recipes which, even with the additional calories, should see you looking trimmer in 12 weeks. The secret lies in the health-boosting properties of the Mediterranean diet – which has inspired every recipe included in my plan.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Based on biggest nutrition study ever carried out</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Mediterranean meals I champion are a far cry from the pizzas and pasta favoured by many in parts of southern Europe today. The version of the diet I am about to describe is very much traditional, and refers to the food that would have been eaten by people who lived in the Mediterranean a generation ago. It is also based on one of the biggest and most important nutrition studies ever carried out; the PREDIMED study (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In this 2013 study, Spanish researchers recruited over 7,400 Spanish overweight, middle-aged men and women and randomly allocated them to either a Mediterranean or a low-fat diet. Both groups were encouraged to eat lots of fresh fruit, vegetables and legumes (such as beans, lentils and peas). They were discouraged from sugary drinks, cakes, sweets or pastries and from eating too much processed meat such as bacon or salami.</p><img id="i-c389388d60957b41" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/28/17/4BA3720C00000578-5669191-image-a-4_1524933564894.jpg" height="408" width="306" alt="Take your lead from my recipes – they are a perfect guide as to how to get the best out of the diet and, whatever your weight-loss goal, live longer, healthier and happier" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Crucially, only those allocated to the Mediterranean diet were asked to eat plenty of eggs, nuts and oily fish, use lots of olive oil and encouraged to eat some dark chocolate and enjoy the occasional glass of wine with their evening meal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In contrast, the low-fat diet group, were told to eat low-fat dairy products and lots of starchy foods such as bread, potatoes, pasta and rice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The researchers followed the volunteers for just under five years, getting them to fill in food diaries and keeping a check on their health via medical examinations, questionnaires and blood and urine samples. All volunteers were given an ‘M score’, according to how closely they stuck to Mediterranean diet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Within three years, dramatic differences between the two groups appeared. Not only were those who had a high M score slimmer, but they were also much healthier, slashing their risk of a multitude of diseases. The benefits were astonishing, and included:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You can calculate your own ‘M’ score by following the instructions below.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other than the abundance of vitamins and antioxidants, there is another, crucial reason why this diet is so super-healthy. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As I discovered while researching my latest book, The Clever Guts Diet, eating Mediterranean-style foods also has a dramatic and positive effect on your gut microbiome – the microbes that live in your gut and which are now proven to be so important for our physical and mental wellbeing.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox health floatRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-300383a0-4b00-11e8-9352-573c8039cc70">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">As with any weight-loss plan, always see your doctor before you start.

It’s another very good reason to give this tasty style of eating a go.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More recently, a study carried out in Australia found that four times as many patients with depression and anxiety who followed a Med diet were able to come off all medication, compared to a control group. Those who stuck closest to the diet enjoyed the biggest improvement in mood.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since the publication of these pioneering studies, the popularity of the Med diet has soared, but there is often some confusion as to which foods qualify as Mediterranean and which do not.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Take your lead from my recipes – they are a perfect guide as to how to get the best out of the diet and, whatever your weight-loss goal, live longer, healthier and happier.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The Do's and Don'ts </strong></p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What you need to know about the NEW 5:2 diet...</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My new diet will help you lose a significant amount of weight as easily as possible, without sacrificing delicious foods.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Based on a Mediterranean diet rich in fish, olive oil, nuts, yogurt, eggs and wholegrains – proven to be one of the</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Healthiest ways to eat – the programme could help you shift a stone in just 12 weeks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The NEW 5:2 applies similar science-based rules to the original 5:2, I pioneered – with a Mediterranean twist. It involves eating a healthy diet five days a week, then cutting your calories down to about 800 for the remaining two ‘fast’ days.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also known as the Fast Dietor ‘intermittent fasting’, eating this way is proven to reduce body fat significantly and helps to prevent a range of age-related diseases. It might seem restrictive, but you’ll be surprised how far 800 calories goes if you choose the right foods.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My recipes can be made in two ways: either high calorie for five non-fasting days, or lowcalorie for the remaining two.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What’s more, they are all nutritious, delicious and will keep you satisfyingly full. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>IF YOU’RE LOOKING TO SHIFT UP TO TWO STONE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For those with a significant amount of weight to lose, use the stricter version of my new 5:2. It involves eating 800 calories a day, every day, therefore opting for the low-calorie version of my recipes. This diet is not for everyone – a list of serious exemptions are listed below left.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before embarking, I strongly recommend visiting my website thebloodsugardiet.com, for lots of helpful advice about how to maintain the diet. Ask yourself how you are feeling mentally and physically throughout, and only if you are feeling good should you continue. Keeping well is your top priority. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>AND FOR EVERYONE ELSE</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don't worry if you don’t want to lose weight, this diet can also tone you up in time for summer. Choose the higher-calorie version of these recipes, and follow a few, basic Med diet rules: avoid starchy carbohydrates such as pasta and potatoes and opt for wholegrains such as quinoa or bulgur (cracked wheat) instead; eat plenty of legumes such as lentils and chickpeas; avoid sugary treats and limit alcohol to an average of one small glass of wine daily. </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-73f27f10-4b02-11e8-9352-573c8039cc70">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Are you a Med diet master?

Is it normal that my partner fakes orgasms?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>YES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We get so hung up on the degree to which women fake orgasms that we may forget men do it too. This can make their partners feel concerned they've done something horribly wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, quite a number of men admit to occasionally faking the big 'O'. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A 2016 study published in the journal Sexual and Relationship Therapy found 30 per cent of North American men said they'd faked it at one time or another.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clinical sexologist Dr Kat van Kirk told Women's Health magazine that the issues that cause men to fake it are similar to those of women.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It’s a similar story to women. Ability to orgasm can be affected by alcohol, tiredness, stress and some medication,' she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, that doesn't mean the sex wasn't any good. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'With his anticipation and the release of bonding hormones like oxytocin, the journey can be just as intense as the orgasm', Dr Van Kirk says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If the issues persists, it may be worth having a discussion and discovering how you can both reach the finish line.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>2. Is it normal that I prefer anal to vaginal sex?</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>YES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Perhaps surprisingly, women who've had some form of anal play say they have more frequent orgasms than those who don't.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is because that part of the body is loaded with sensitive nerve endings, according to sexologist Jessica O'Reilly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The area is actually anatomically configured for mind-blowing orgasms, so if you’ve experienced that, there’s no surprise you want to go back for more,' she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The super-sensitive nerve endings make it a responsive erogenous zone.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Actual penetration is not necessary for those who are concerned about hygiene. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Start off with a small butt plug,' O’Reilly advises. 'Or use a vibrator around the entrance to really up the anal fun ante.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="health-ccox"><span class="health-ccox"><strong>3.

Is it normal that I masturbate five times a week?</strong></strong></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="health-ccox"><strong><strong>YES</strong></strong></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Women in general report masturbating less often than men - but that doesn't mean it's unhealthy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The 2009 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB) from Indiana University found only three per cent of women masturbated more than four times a week, for example. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The reasons why women do it less then men (17 per cent of whom reported masturbating the same) are unknown, but it's been said to improve mood and vaginal strength.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Regardless, 'masturbation is a common sexual practice among women,' Dr. Kelly Suschinsky said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Women masturbate for a variety of reasons - to feel sexual pleasure, cope with stress, help them fall asleep, or to have a sexual outlet while their partner is unavailable. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'As long as it’s not causing a problem in your relationship or interfering with your wider life, then just enjoy it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="health-ccox"><strong>6. Is it normal that I'm straight but when it comes to porn, I only get turned on by girl-on-girl?</strong></span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><span class="health-ccox"><strong>YES</strong></span></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Research has shown that porn viewing habits are not reflective of secret sexual lusts in women.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A study by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health at the University of Toronto found that, while male arousal matched their sexual orientation, women showed little preference between different types of porn.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In other word, women were equally aroused by watching heterosexual sex as by female-only sex, regardless of their sexuality.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'In fact, the research found that both women who were attracted to men and women who were attracted to other women reported that they were most sexually aroused by the videos that showed women-only sexual activities,' the researchers say.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>There are many sex-related questions women never find out the answer to because they are too embarrassed to raise them.

But they could be signs of a simple problem: magnesium deficiency.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Daily Mail's Dr Michael Moseley addressed the issue recently when he <span style="font-size: 16px;">appeared on BBC Radio Two’s Breakfast Show with Chris Evans – exploring how the humble mineral could treat a range of common ailments including migraines, PMT and constipation.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet it doesn't get a lot of attention.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong> </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1. You can’t stay asleep</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Studies have shown that when magnesium levels are too low, it’s harder to stay asleep. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Magnesium contributes to the normal function of the nervous system thereby offering nervous system support which may then assist with sleep disturbance,’ said Rick Hay, London-based nutritionist and author of The Anti Ageing Food &amp; Fitness Plan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Magnesium increases a chemical neurotransmitter in the brain called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which encourages relaxation as well as sleep. Low GABA levels in the body can make it difficult to relax. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Magnesium promotes good sleep by helping us unwind, Hay explains, and it’s an important factor in how our body manages its sleep cycle. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, a 2012 study found that 500mg magnesium taken for eight weeks before bed had a positive improvement on insomnia levels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. You’re depressed</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Magnesium has a role in hormonal regulation and may also help blood sugar balance which can help with mood issues such as depression and anxiety,’ said Mr Hay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Positive neurotransmitters in the brain such as serotonin are regulated by magnesium, and such neurotransmitters are essential to a stable mood. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Excitingly, researchers last year published a study in the journal PLoS One that found adults who received 248mg of magnesium a day for six weeks saw a significant improvement in their levels of depression and anxiety.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. You get migraines</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’re one of the one in seven people who get migraines in the UK, supplementing with magnesium could help. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Although evidence for magnesium’s role in migraine treatment is limited it’s very promising,’ said Mr Hay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, one study published in the European Journal for Neutraceutical Research found that using topical Magnesium Oil Spray from BetterYou across a three-month period helped improve the severity and frequency of symptoms.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘This effect on reducing the severity of migraines was probably due to magnesium’s hormonal regulating benefits and its muscle relaxation properties,’ explained Mr Hay. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4. You crave chocolate</strong></p><img id="i-c857ddaf224dcc3a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/09/13/47F0E3D800000578-5250109-image-m-12_1515504656696.jpg" height="474" width="634" alt="Craving chocolate can be a sign of a magnesium deficiency, experts believe (stock image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cravings for specific foods can indicate nutrient deficiency and if it’s chocolate you’re craving most often, a lack of magnesium could be the reason. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The sweet treat is high in magnesium and because our levels go down during and before our period, some experts suggest what we’re really craving when we reach for chocolate pre-menstrually is magnesium.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The highest levels are found in dark chocolate that is over 60 per cent cocoa.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5. You get muscle spasms</strong></p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-4e571a20-f541-11e7-8813-b735320d7e1e">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">GOOD SOURCES OF MAGNESIUM </h3><div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Magnesium is found in a wide variety of foods, including:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Green leafy vegetables – such as spinach</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">How much magnesium do I need?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The amount of magnesium you need is:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You should be able to get all the magnesium you need from your daily diet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Source: NHS Choices </span></p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a muscle relaxant, magnesium works alongside calcium to regulate muscle movement. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have too much calcium and not enough magnesium, the muscles of any part of your body can go into spasm. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This can manifest as leg cramps, muscle pain, tightness and general aches, according to Mr Hay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>6. You suffer eye twitches</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘One of the most common ways magnesium deficiency can manifest is through eye twitches,’ Mr Hay explained. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That’s a symptom related to the mineral’s ability to regulate muscle movement – too little and your muscles, including those of your eyes, can spasm and twitch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>7. You have an irregular heartbeat</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Magnesium helps maintain a normal heart rhythm and doctors sometimes administer it intravenously (IV) in the hospital to reduce the chance of atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s central to a healthy heart rhythm because it’s involved in transporting other minerals such as calcium and potassium into cells. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Magnesium deficiency increases irregular heartbeats known as arrhythmias because it causes levels of such nutrients as calcium in the blood to drop. In one study of women, higher dietary intake of magnesium was associated with a lower risk of sudden cardiac death.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>8. You’re always tired</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Magnesium is part of the body’s natural energy production system and contributes to energy release,’ says Rick Hay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> Low energy levels and fatigue have been linked to low magnesium levels within the body because magnesium is needed for the body to produce adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) which is essential to creating energy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>9. You have acne, eczema or other skin problems</strong></p><img id="i-d0498a740a0125b0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/09/13/47F0EC1D00000578-5250109-image-m-14_1515504825178.jpg" height="462" width="634" alt="Skin problems including acne and eczema can be caused by having low levels of the mineral (stock image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Magnesium is great for reducing inflammation, which often accompanies (or can be caused by) skin disorders such as acne, eczema, psoriasis and rosacea. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In one study on over 3000 post-menopausal women, increased magnesium intake was responsible for reducing three separate biomarkers for inflammation: CRP (C-reactive protein), TNF (tumor necrosis factor alpha), and IL6 (interleukin-6). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, bathing in magnesium has long been considered a treatment for inflammation related skin problems such as eczema. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Magnesium also helps regulate vitamin D, which is essential for the health of the skin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Magnesium supplements – what you need to know</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Taking an oral magnesium supplement can sometime cause stomach upsets, said Mr Hay.

Most of us know that fizzy drinks are bad for our waistlines as well as our teeth, with the equivalent of about seven teaspoons of sugar in a can of Coca-Cola. But is it just the sugar that is contributing to weight gain, or could it be the bubbles, too?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I love sparkling, carbonated water and when I first saw a study from the University of Birzeit, in the West Bank, showing that adding bubbles to sugary water made rats fatter and hungrier than a flat, sugary drink did, I thought it sounded a bit unlikely.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But in the <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="/news/bbc/index.html">BBC2 </a>series Trust Me, I’m A Doctor, we like to examine even the most unlikely health claims — and as you’ll see in tomorrow’s programme, we put this finding to the test. We started by asking Dr James Brown, from Aston University in <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/birmingham/index.html" id="mol-afc11050-ef5a-11e7-92c3-ff79852b26ad">Birmingham</a>, who has a particular interest in obesity and diabetes, to help us run our study.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We then recruited a group of healthy volunteers. The key thing was, we didn’t tell them what the experiment was really about because we didn’t want that knowledge to interfere with the results.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead of telling them it was mainly about bubbles, we said it was concerned with measuring the impact of sugary drinks on people’s appetite.</p><img id="i-68013470bfa1d0e4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/02/01/1FBA398700000578-0-image-a-6_1514855492354.jpg" height="395" width="634" alt="This includes soft drinks. Most of us know that fizzy drinks are bad for our waistlines as well as our teeth, with the equivalent of about seven teaspoons of sugar in a can of Coca-Cola" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">First, our volunteers fasted for ten hours. They were then given identical calorie-controlled cheese sandwiches to eat, to ensure as best we could that they all started off equally full.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An hour later, each volunteer was given one of four drinks, which were allocated at random: a glass of a fizzy sugary drink, a glass of the same drink but flat, a glass of fizzy water or a glass of flat water.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ten minutes after they’d had their drink, James took a blood sample to measure their ghrelin levels. Ghrelin is one of the so-called ‘hunger hormones’ which is produced in your stomach and then goes to your brain to say: ‘I am hungry, I should eat.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our volunteers were then sent away with a food diary, so we could assess how many calories they consumed in the hours following their drink. We repeated the experiment three times over the next couple of weeks, but each time our volunteers were given a different drink, so by the end they’d had all four drinks.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">On their final visit, we told them the true purpose of the study and James gave them the results.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘What we found was really exciting,’ he told them. ‘When you had a fizzy drink your ghrelin levels were about 50 per cent higher than when you had a non-fizzy drink.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In other words, drinking a fizzy, sugary drink makes you a lot hungrier an hour later than drinking the same drink, but flat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This increase in ghrelin wasn’t only seen after drinking sugary fizzy drinks; there was also a slight effect when James and his team compared the impact of carbonated with still water.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it wasn’t just their levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin: when we looked at the effect fizz had on how much food our volunteers ate later in the day, we found they consumed on average 120 calories more after they’d had a carbonated drink than after a non-carbonated one. ‘That is a really significant finding,’ James told me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So, on top of the 140 calories in the fizzy drink, they consumed another 120 calories later in the day as a direct result of the extra ghrelin produced by having had a fizzy drink.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But why should bubbles have this effect?</p><img id="i-35ba184393b8bd23" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/02/01/314A726400000578-0-image-a-10_1514855554371.jpg" height="306" width="306" alt="In other words, drinking a fizzy, sugary drink makes you a lot hungrier an hour later than drinking the same drink, but flat" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">We don’t know for sure, but James thinks there are two possible reasons. The first is that when you knock back a fizzy drink, carbon dioxide — the gas used to make drinks fizzy — directly causes receptor cells in your stomach to release ghrelin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another possibility is that the stomach bloats and stretches a little bit from that extra gas, and it is this stretching that stimulates cells to release ghrelin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So does that mean it’s ok to drink flat, sugary drinks?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No, says James. ‘I think the take-home message from this, sadly and boringly, is that the healthiest option is probably still water.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is early days, but our test provides another really good reason why you should steer clear of the fizzy sweet stuff.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for me, I’ll still have the occasional glass of fizzy water. But in light of these findings — and to cut down my plastic consumption — I’ll probably go more for tap water in future.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Trust Me, I’m a Doctor, Wednesday, January 3, BBC2, 8.30pm.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Top of many people’s New Year resolutions list will be getting slimmer and a bit healthier by cutting down the calories — and, clearly, one particularly good way to do that is to cut back on the sweet stuff.

Sip water slowly</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If your mother swears by a glass of warm water to ease trapped wind then she knew what she was talking about.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Dr Wakim-Fleming, this does two things. Firstly it can help to get any undigested foods to get moving through your digestive system.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The walls of the intestines are lined with layers of muscle that contract as they move food through your digestive tract. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So secondly, sipping water prevents them from contracting too quickly and strongly, creating painful spasms. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. Reduce the amount of air you swallow</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Drinking water helps but don't take big gulps o at a time, warns Dr Wakim-Fleming. Avoid using straws, drinking fizzy beveragesand chewing gum. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don't talk and eat at the same time, sit down to eat (sitting upright and not slumped over), and chew with your mouth closed so that you're not taking in excess air.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. Get up and walk around</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It might feel like that last thing you want to do when you're in agony, but some gentle exercise can  help clear up painful gas and bloating. A quick walk or other gentle movement can work wonders.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Try doing toe touch stretches to let gravity  work to get the gas out of your body.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Twisting exercises can help push air out of digestive system, this can be done in a chair or on the ground. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sit with your feet facing forward then rotate your torso to the right and reach around to hold back of the chair, then repeat other direction. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4. Cut down on dairy if you think it is  the culprit</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the main symptoms of lactose intolerance is bloating. But even if you aren't intolerant, dairy is well known for causing indigestion and it's possible you've overindulged on the cheeseboard and creamy Bailey's.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Dr Staller, many people in their twenties and thirties have symptoms and don’t suspect that it’s the dairy products.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So if you suspect dairy is contributing to your painful wind, try cutting it out for a few weeks – or at the very least, the rest of the day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5. Drink peppermint tea</strong> </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Peppermint is said to relieve bloating by relaxing your muscles and allowing you to release any pent up gas or flatulence, says Dr Staller.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has a spasmolytic affect, meaning it can help your intestines from cramping – which is what increases wind.</p><img id="i-476cdb8b01b29fb2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/26/02/4781653F00000578-5202889-Peppermint_tea_is_said_to_relieve_bloating_by_relaxing_the_muscl-a-8_1514254048473.jpg" height="422" width="633" alt="Peppermint tea is said to relieve bloating by relaxing the muscles in your digestive system (stock image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">While this is well known to happen with sufferers of irritable bowel syndrome, the same process of muscle contractions occurs during general bouts of trapped wind, he explained.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Peppermint tea should not be given to small children or infants or taken by people with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Check with your doctor if you're unsure if you should take it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>6. Apply a heated pad on your stomach</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don't forget that exercising and movement helps – but along with this you could try cozying up under a blanket with a heated pad on your abdomen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Warmth can have an antispasmodic effect on your body and help your intestines to relax instead of contract too hard or too much, said Dr Wakim-Fleming.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>7. Up your fiber intake</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We're always told to up our fiber intake to help keep our digestive systems running smoothly.It bulks up your stool, which helps you stay regular and avoid constipated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But on the other hand, consuming too much  can make you gassy as the bacteria in your colon works to break this tough nutrient down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The vegetables you've had on your Christmas dinner, especially broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage, can cause problems. It's <span style="font-size: 16px;">best to avoid those foods until you feel better.</span> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Flatulence occurs when food fails to breakdown  in the stomach and intestines.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1. Tight underwear</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's commonly advised that men who want to become a father should switch from briefs to boxers. The fear is that the tighter briefs keep the testicles closer to the body, resulting in warmer testicles which lowers sperm count.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Scientists from Stanford University in California and the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development carried out tests on 501 men who were trying to become fathers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Men who want to become a father should wear boxer shorts rather than briefs – and go to bed in the nude.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They found that a man’s choice of underwear makes a big difference to the quality of their sperm. </p><img id="i-36944ed8f4b27ee4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/09/28/13/44D2069200000578-4929146-image-a-11_1506601152068.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Studies suggest wearing tight underwear can harm sperm production (stock photo)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of the group, those who wore loose boxer shorts during the day and no underwear in bed had 25 per cent lower levels of damaged DNA in their sperm compared to those who wore tight pants both at night and during the day. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It seems that airier, cooler underpants help preserve vital reproductive cells. And at night, wearing no underwear at all gives the best results. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, Dr Sabanegh points out that research has been mixed and says it is more important for men to feel relaxed – indeed stress has been linked to lower male infertility. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. Laptops</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Experts say the testes work at an optimum temperature of around 35°C (95°F), or two degrees cooler than body temperature.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Laptops can reach internal operating temperatures of over 70°C (158°F) – so placing it directly in your lap can transfer some of that heat. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, according to Yefim Sheynkin from the State University of New York at Stonybrook, who carried out research into laptops and male fertility, it is possible that years of heavy laptop use 'may cause irreversible or partially reversible changes in male reproductive function'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some laptop pads shield the testicles from the heat, but only for a short period of time. Dr Sabanegh recommends using your laptop on a desk or table instead. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. Saunas and hot tubs</strong></p><img id="i-a41df416a1e9d5ed" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/09/28/15/44D1E80700000578-4929146-Dr_Sabanegh_isn_t_too_worried_about_the_effects_of_saunas_on_his-a-1_1506608524352.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Dr Sabanegh isn't too worried about the effects of saunas on his clients trying for children but warns hot tubs can impact male fertility (stock photo)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Modern saunas session can reach temperatures up to 100°C (212 °F).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Because of their structure, the testicles may not be too affected, said Dr Sabanegh.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, he said hot tubs are problematic because the testicles are completely submerged in the hot water and have no way to cool off.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead, they warm up to a higher level than doctors consider safe for healthy fertility.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So if you're worried about infertility, it's best to skip the hot tub.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4.

I thought I must have somehow pulled a muscle and I wanted to get as much heat into it as possible. I’d go home and push a hot water bottle into my back until my skin was red raw.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Occasionally the excruciating spasms would radiate into Lisa’s breast and armpit and even as far as her elbow. ‘But I assumed it was all a knock-on effect of a pulled muscle in my back,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I thought perhaps I’d picked something up the wrong way.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After several weeks of agony, the mother-of-two described the symptom to her GP and asked for some naproxen; she had found this powerful anti-inflammatory effective when she suffered whiplash in a car accident a few years earlier.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But this time the drug only made a slight difference. And it wasn’t until three months after the symptom appeared that Lisa discovered what was really wrong: she had breast cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although a lump in the breast is the most obvious and best known symptom of breast cancer, one in six women with this disease have symptoms other than a lump, according to a study of more than 2,000 women published in May in the journal Cancer Epidemiology.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These can include a swollen arm, breathlessness, weight loss or, as in Lisa’s case, back pain.</p><img id="i-479dd7417f5723a4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/09/04/19/43E7E61200000578-4851764-image-a-5_1504551190117.jpg" height="953" width="634" alt="Battle: For months the 46 year-old assumed she had lifted something incorrectly and caused minor damage to her muscles or, worse, her discs" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">But because of a lack of awareness about such symptoms these women are more likely to wait three months or more before seeing their GP than those who find a lump, the University College London (UCL) researchers said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed the possibility of cancer only occurred to Lisa — and her GP — when she finally found a lump herself, on holiday with a friend in Lanzarote three months later in April 2014.</p><div class="mol-article-quote floatRHS health" id="mol-6dfc7630-91a6-11e7-b2e9-cd24bccfdd87">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"><strong> I hadn’t contemplated checking my breasts when my back was hurting</strong></div>                        <div class="mol-article-quote-attribution"><div>Lisa Harvey </div></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I hadn’t contemplated checking my breasts when my back was hurting,’ says Lisa, 46, who is married to Tim, 51, a sales director.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But I’d forgotten to pack the shower puff I wash with, so I had to use my hands.’ That’s how she came to find a pea-sized lump, on the underside of her right breast.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She went back to her doctor after her holiday and was immediately referred for tests that confirmed the cancer diagnosis. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thankfully, although the tumour was aggressive, it was still confined to the breast. One in eight women are diagnosed with breast cancer during their life and the symptom of back pain is typically associated with cancer that has spread to the bones.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Bones are the most common site of secondary breast cancer, and it tends to affect large bones such as the spine, ribs and shoulder blades,’ explains Emma Pennery, clinical director of the charity Breast Cancer Care.</p><img id="i-b479452cefde9fc8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/09/04/19/43E7E5F900000578-4851764-image-a-6_1504551196398.jpg" height="953" width="634" alt="Recovery: Later a lump appeared in her breast and, thankfully, it was confined to that area " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">A swollen arm, breathlessness and weight loss — some of the symptoms flagged up in the recent UCL study — also tend to be associated with breast cancer that’s spread (to the lymph nodes in the arm or lungs, for example). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However there are a number of reasons why back pain may occur with cancer confined to the breast too. ‘Sometimes the specific location of the cancer can trigger a symptom, such as pain, for example by pushing on a nerve,’ says Emma Pennery. ‘There’s also a recognised syndrome called referred pain, where pain is felt in a part of the body other than its source.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We don’t know exactly why this happens, but because cancer attaches to tissue and can pull down on it, and can intrude on blood vessels and nerves, that can sometimes lead to pain elsewhere in the body.’ General ill health, too, can be a trigger for back pain, explains Dr Martin Johnson, clinical lead for chronic pain for the Royal College of General Practitioners.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘If someone isn’t feeling well they become less mobile and start to slouch, causing back pain — your muscles get stiffer and can start to spasm.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s also possible that someone may have back pain and then find a breast lump, but the two events are not entirely connected.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One difficulty is that back pain ‘is one of the vaguest symptoms known to man’, says Dr Johnson. ‘Nearly everyone gets it at some point in their life and the vast majority of it is muscular.’</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-50b71070-91a7-11e7-b2e9-cd24bccfdd87">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">CAN DIET CAUSE BREAST CANCER?  </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Researchers estimate that we might be able to prevent as many as 9 out of every 100 cancer cases (9%) by changing our diets. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> Research also suggests that about 5 out of 100 cancers (5%) could be avoided by maintaining a healthy body weight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">An overview study has reported that women had an increased risk of breast cancer if they had more fats in their diet after the menopause. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another study has shown that women who ate higher levels of saturated fats had double the risk of breast cancer compared to those eating the least. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">People who eat a lot of foods containing fish oils (marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) seem to have a lower breast cancer risk than people who only eat small amounts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> <strong>SOURCE: Cancer Research UK</strong> </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">For this reason, Breast Cancer Care does not list it as a key symptom of the disease. ‘As there are so many things that can cause back pain, from the very banal to the more serious, it could be misleading — you don’t want everyone with back pain to assume they have breast cancer,’ explains Emma Pennery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘That said, it’s important that if someone has a symptom that’s not going away and is difficult to explain — that is, there’s not obvious cause, such as having spent three hours digging in your allotment — then it’s sensible to see your GP.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other red flags that indicate there may be a more serious cause include pain that wakes you at night or that gets worse despite the patient taking painkillers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unfortunately there is a lack of awareness surrounding the less well-known symptoms — on the part of patients but also potentially among GPs, says Dr Anne Rigg, a consultant medical oncologist at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Hospital Trust in London.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for patients, she adds: ‘There is no doubt that when there is a lump, almost everyone knows that it might be cancer and they go and see a doctor quickly. When it’s a lesser known symptom people do tend to see a doctor much later.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By the time Lisa received her diagnosis she had prepared herself for the fact it might be cancer. ‘But when I broke it to my husband he looked as though he’d been punched in the face,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She had surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and tamoxifen, a hormone therapy drug, and says: ‘The worst thing was that the treatment put me into an early menopause — I’ve have hot flushes and joint pain as a result.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But the back pain subsided when I had surgery, and as far as I’m aware I’m free from cancer now.

I’m now being treated to help me avoid another one’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like me, many of you might have received a similar mailing from Bluecrest, offering screening appointments in your area. These are typically held in hotels or conference centres. With over 1,700 such clinics across the UK, Bluecrest are one of a number of commercial organisations that market health screening.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For a basic screening (price £129), I was offered checks to assess my risk of heart disease and stroke, my liver and kidney function, energy, muscles and bones. I’d get a gout check, diabetes check, a full lipid profile (cholesterol etc) and a metabolism check.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If I took up the offer within 28 days, I’d have my body fat percentage measured for free, ditto height and weight, my ten-year heart disease risk and (because I’m over 50) lung function.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And for £70 extra, I’d get a full blood count. Bluecrest explained: ‘With blood disorders early detection is critical; many issues can be cured but treatment is required straight away.’</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I imagine that many people would think this was money very well spent. But is it?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the NHS was created in 1948, there was little concept of health screening, ie checking to unearth previously undetected conditions — a sort of stitch in time saves nine approach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fast forward 30 years to when I started out as a GP trainee in Barnes, West London. By then we were conducting smear tests and looking at cholesterol levels, blood pressure and smoking history as risk factors in heart disease, but there was little appetite for NHS health screening as we, too, were under the cosh financially.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet even back in 1972, Sir Richard Bayliss, physician to the Queen and the consultant under whom I trained, published an article in the British Medical Journal questioning screening.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His view was that the most important information comes from the conversation with the doctor, when a patient’s medical history, their family history and lifestyle help identify the genuine risk factors. Anything else — blood tests, X-rays, physical examination — is secondary.</p><img id="i-35f119e203fde402" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/12/23/415F80DF00000578-4597558-image-a-3_1497305765445.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Sceptical:  Back in 1972, Sir Richard Bayliss, physician to the Queen and the consultant under whom I trained, published an article in the British Medical Journal questioning screening" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even now, with technology such as MRI or CT scans, it is the conversation with the doctor that is important; and subsidiary to that, simple tests including weight, blood pressure and a physical examination.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So when I received my Bluecrest letter, my initial reaction was to ignore it — but I know some of my patients have received this mailing, or similar, and curiosity got the better of me, so I booked myself in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ‘clinic’ itself was in the basement of a seaside hotel in Lowestoft, Suffolk, the examination room a meeting room converted for the day with a few items of equipment, including a tray with blood taking kit and an electrocardiogram (ECG) machine to check heart activity. There were also scales similar to those you can buy on the High Street and a portable examination couch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The technician conducting the check-up had worked in the ambulance service as a trained driver, and although utterly professional, it seemed he was working according to a script — and that meant straight into the tests.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Indeed, I was astonished that there was no interest in my medical history, which meant Bluecrest had no idea I’d been a kidney donor, that I had undergone abdominal surgery for intestinal blockage, that I had a history of sarcoidosis (an inflammatory disorder mainly involving the lungs), or that I’d undergone eye surgery three times in the past year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This had implications for my tests. For instance, the steroids I took for a year could affect my blood sugar levels or blood pressure; the sarcoidosis caused 12kg weight loss (which affected my BMI, but more of that later).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nor was I asked about my family history or my occupation, which might be relevant in terms of risk factors for future disease. The screening tests themselves, dressed up to look very grand in the printed material, were so lightweight it was embarrassing for me as a medical practitioner.</p><img id="i-88611ce25e60c50b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/12/23/415F807A00000578-4597558-image-a-4_1497305769369.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Not thorough: Dr Scurr was astonished that there was no interest in his medical history" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I was asked to remove my shoes and socks (I volunteered to take off my jacket, heavy with phone, keys, wallet and diary) and my height and weight were measured.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Electrical contacts were placed under my feet to calculate my body fat percentage. Bluecrest states proudly that they give you a free body fat percentage, height, weight and BMI calculations, but anyone can do all this at home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I then had to lie down and roll up a sleeve and trouser leg to have my blood pressure measured via cuffs applied to an arm and a leg — a pretty simplistic measure of the health of your arteries.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-f6ce9110-4fbf-11e7-a75b-dd5e4dae4a5c">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"><strong> I was astonished that there was no interest in my medical history, which meant Bluecrest had no idea I’d been a kidney donor, had undergone abdominal surgery or that I had a history of sarcoidosis</strong></div>                        <div class="mol-article-quote-attribution"><div>Dr Martin Scurr </div></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">My heart rhythm was checked by attaching an electrode to each of my four limbs. In GP practices we use 12-lead ECGs, with six leads on the chest, so the Bluecrest version is a bit pathetic really.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finally, a blood test was painlessly and efficiently obtained from my arm. I was excluded from the lung function test as the technician asked if there was any reason I shouldn’t blow hard into the tiny spirometer, and I explained I’d recently undergone eye surgery, so this test was postponed for six months. For an extra £49, I was offered a PSA blood test for prostate cancer which I declined. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As Good Health readers will know, it’s a controversial screening test because of the high risk of false positives; it can also lead to over-diagnosis and over-treatment. None of this was explained. And my view is that offering it requires careful counselling — well beyond this technician’s level of training I thought.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The screening took 30 minutes in all, and you’re meant to receive the full report of your results within 21 days. Mine arrived just one day short of the six-week mark — the kind of delay that might cause anxiety. (What could be amiss? Were Bluecrest obtaining further specialist opinions?)</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The results themselves are presented with an introductory text about each, marked by a green, amber or red flag, followed by advice about what to do next.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The good news is that I don’t have gout, though I suspect I might have guessed this from the lack of symptoms. Also, I had no red flags (ie, results well outside the normal range). But I did have six amber flags that triggered recommendations either to see my GP or undergo a repeat test in six or 12 months.</p><img id="i-2c9a68f9b3fc673f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/12/23/414EBD1300000578-4597558-image-a-5_1497306825617.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Mass audience: Thousands are encouraged to buy into the private health screenings, which usually take place in packed conference centers " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, not one of those amber flags was worth a jot to an informed medical practitioner. All had to be seen in the context of my own history, weight and age — yet for the uninitiated, every one of those amber flags could be a reason for sleepless nights.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the ambers was for my kidney function, with abnormal levels of eGFR. My levels were between 60 to 80, denoting a mild reduction in kidney function — if I was a young adult, that is.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I called my colleague, a kidney specialist, who not only said my level was better than his, but that levels decline after the age of 60. He said a better test of kidney function is a urine test for protein — easy and cheap to do. So why no urine test in a Bluecrest screen?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another amber was for heart rhythm. It seems I had ‘a slight abnormality’, a so-called right bundle branch block, and again I was recommended to see my GP. However, I’ve had that variation all my adult life, first noted when I was a medical student: so it is normal for me, not an abnormality.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-336b13a0-4fc0-11e7-a75b-dd5e4dae4a5c">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> <span class="health-ccox"><strong>It is beyond doubt a screen such as this will raise the workload for overburdened GPs and prove unsettling for the worried well.

Given that I am healthy, with no bleeding tendencies, no bruising and well in every respect, it can safely be ignored, like going 31 miles per hour in a 30 mile zone. Another example of how lab results must be compared with the patient’s history.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I had similar tiny increases in my total cholesterol and ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol levels: again not an issue in a man who is very lightweight with the blood pressure of an 18-year-old, but sufficient to gain another amber flag, so more for my GP to go through. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another amber flag was raised for my total iron binding capacity — a measure of the iron-carrying proteins in the blood. It was minimally below normal, other tests showed my iron itself was normal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">More worry for the uninitiated, and another topic to take up GP time. My BMI was low, another amber flag but not surprising given my sarcoidosis. But the flag came with patronising advice about the need to maintain a healthy body weight. And to see my GP. Quite apart from whether health screening saves lives, it is beyond doubt a screen such as this will raise the workload for overburdened GPs and prove unsettling for the worried well. My view is that these lightweight check-ups are a waste of money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The important thing to protect your health is to stick to the following: take regular cardiovascular exercise, eat at least five items of fruit or vegetables daily, cut back on salt and sugar, avoid smoking, and stick to alcohol intake guidelines.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">PCD at some point in their life was reported by a whopping 46 per cent of 230 Australian female university students surveyed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another study found a higher correlation of PCD among identical and non-identical twins, suggested the condition may be hereditary.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Hallucinations</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some women have reported their lover has literally taken them to another world.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of nearly 50 females who reported experiencing 'expanded sexual response,' 76 per cent to 100 per cent said they felt a sensation of flying, according to a 2011 study from Turkey.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Up to 75 per cent claimed they had a feeling of leaving their bodies and up to 24 per cent noted a sense of entering a cartoon world.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Almost a quarter of respondents reported after climaxing experiencing the phenomenon of having the strong sensation that a current experience  has already been experienced in the past, known as déjà vu.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sneezing</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Reports linking sneezing and orgasms date back to the 1900s - in fact, one case from 1972 describes a 59-year-old man who developed severe sneezing and a runny nose after orgasm, which continued for 10 years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Experts believe that activating one part of the parasympathetic nervous system during orgasm may trigger a different branch of it, too, which causes sneezing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sickness </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Labelled 'post-orgasm illness syndrome', this is a side-effect that can affect men after ejaculation.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The researchers describe men reporting severe fatigue, overheating, and a temporary flu-like state after sex. 'Onset of these symptoms is rapid and can last up to four to seven days' said the report.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The scientists explain that the body can misidentify proteins in your own semen as foreign invaders, which ramps up the immune system response and makes you feel ill.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Seizures </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the more distressing side-effects of post-orgasm phenomenon is what's technically known as orgasmolepsy - a form of reflex epilepsy after orgasm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was first recorded in 1960, when a pregnant 23-year-old woman developed partial seizures in the second trimester of her second pregnancy. After the birth, these seizures recurred, frequently immediately after orgasm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another 20-year-old patient had epileptic attacks triggered by masturbation or fantasies. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Scientists do not fully understand what causes it, but they think firing of the amygdala response - coupled with hypocretin deficiency, which occurs with narcolepsy - may be to blame. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Pain</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Females can experience pain with orgasm even if she doesn't feel pain with intercourse, according to the review.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A 2009 study reported three cases of women who experienced this, without any physical causes of pain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Men are not immune, either - patients with chronic prostate disease have also been known to experience pain with orgasm, too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>An orgasm in the foot </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to a 2013 case report in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, a 55-year-old woman said that when she experienced a vaginal or clitoral orgasm while having sex with her husband, she felt the same sensation in her left foot afterwards. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The researchers believe it may be due to partial regeneration of damaged nerve fibres in her foot.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Headache</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are more than 60 published articles in the literature on the topic of orgasm-associated headache.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">In one study of 800 people, 77 per cent of those who had suffered an attack had the crease, compared to 40 per cent of those in a group of non-heart attack victims. Frank’s sign is named after the American doctor Sanders T Frank, who noticed in 1973 that the ear lobe crease was common in young patients with the heart condition angina. Besides the theory that the creases indicate clogged arteries, another possibility is that they are a sign of accelerated ageing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Creased earlobes are not the only visible indicator of potential health problems.

The top number, the systolic reading, is the pressure when your heart contracts; the second, the diastolic, is the pressure when your heart rests between beats.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">High blood pressure means that every time the heart beats, the blood is flowing with greater force than normal, and this can weaken the artery walls and heart.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘About a third of our population doesn’t know what their blood pressure is,’ says Dr Adrian Brady, a consultant cardiologist at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary and president of the British and Irish Hypertension Society (BIHS).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It’s a measurement that changes from moment to moment, but even having a snapshot of what it is can make someone aware they could have high blood pressure, which is by far the biggest cause of cardiovascular disease.’</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most new digital monitors, which cost from £15 to £130 and can be used at home, measure through a cuff the vibrations of the blood against the artery wall. But are they any good?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To find out, we asked Steve Honest, 56, a father of one from Shoreditch, East London, to test out some of the newest and most popular devices. Steve, who runs the shop Friendship Vegan Shoes, has recently been diagnosed with hypertension. Although he doesn’t yet take medication for it, he’s been advised to record his blood pressure daily and exercise more.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before he tested the monitors, his blood pressure was checked at a Bupa Health Centre to get an accurate measurement. His reading was 155/97.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We asked Graham MacGregor, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Wolfson Institute, London and chairman of Blood Pressure UK to give his view.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>QardioArm Wireless Blood Pressure unit</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Now £83.47, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2rMMX8a">amazon.co.uk</a></strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Reading: 148/103</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">STEVE’S VERDICT: It’s stylish. The monitor is on a soft cuff that goes around your upper arm — there’s no wire, tube (which is used on some devices to inflate the cuff) or even screen, because the results appear on your smartphone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">First, you download an app to your phone and then connect it to the machine via Bluetooth. When your blood pressure and heart rate have been measured, results are sent to the app. I’m fairly techy, but I struggled to find the app and it took more than 20 attempts to connect it. It was pretty accurate, but its initial connection issues let it down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">EXPERT’S VERDICT: The reading is reliable enough as it’s within ten points of the clinical result.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This type of device, with a phone replacing the traditional separate screen, is certainly the way these monitors are going. It makes recording your blood pressure more convenient, which might encourage more people to do it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If your GP tells you to monitor yourself, you should do it every day — ideally twice in the morning and twice the evening. 6/10</p><img id="i-790cf7d3867b6dd7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/22/21/40ACEF5D00000578-4531544-image-a-5_1495484464898.jpg" height="272" width="306" alt="Cheap and cheerful?

To use the machine — which is on top of the cuff — you strap it around your wrist and hold up your arm in line with your heart, with your palms flat and facing upwards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When you press a button, the cuff starts to inflate. I took several readings and some were very bizarre. I didn’t have any faith that the measurements were reliable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">EXPERT’S VERDICT: Not only is this reading much higher than the clinical one, but monitors like this, which take readings on the wrist rather than the upper arm, are notoriously unreliable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s difficult for people to know precisely where to put their wrist when testing their own blood pressure, and this can make a big difference to results. Lifting your arm above your head, for instance, lowers the blood pressure measurement significantly because of the effects of gravity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This could explain why several of Steve’s readings on this device were so erratic. 2/10</p><img id="i-d17cf608fec759aa" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/22/21/40ACEF4B00000578-4531544-image-a-4_1495484460443.jpg" height="292" width="306" alt="Stylish: The Omron device has a clear display and I found it very simple to set up and use" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Omron Evolv Upper Arm Monitor</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>£129.99, <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2rdK9Ee">boots.com</a></strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>READING: 145/91</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">STEVE’S VERDICT: It looks very sleek and advanced, with its screen attached to a wide, comfy cuff.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Most people's image of the typical acid reflux patient is an overweight, middle-aged man who's overdone it on burgers or pizza and is complaining of heartburn.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But as an ear, nose and throat doctor, I see patients every day who break the stereotypical mould — for acid damage afflicts people of all ages, including the very young. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In fact, more than 7 million Britons suffer from it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it doesn't just manifest itself as heartburn or regurgitation. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These aren't even the most common symptoms — in my practice, most acid reflux patients are more likely to have throat-related complaints, such as a lump-like sensation that causes difficulty swallowing.</p><img id="i-90df70dafa45483" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/31/00/3CAD272D00000578-0-Most_acid_reflux_patients_are_more_likely_to_have_throat_related-a-41_1485821636973.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Most acid reflux patients are more likely to have throat-related complaints, such as a lump-like sensation that causes difficulty swallowing" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other common symptoms include a chronic cough (that persists longer than eight weeks), frequent throat-clearing, hoarseness and a sore throat. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Often, someone with these symptoms won't realise they have reflux because the oesophageal tissues have likely been exposed to acid for so long, they've been numbed to its effects.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These 'silent' symptoms mean the condition can be overlooked, which has its own risks: a growing number of people are now succumbing to oesophageal cancer — the most extreme manifestation of acid damage.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But why are so many of us plagued by acid reflux in the first place? The answer, I believe, lies in the food and drink we consume every day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Doctors used to be concerned about only the acid that came up from the stomach into the oesophagus — now we know the problem is also the acid from certain foods on their way down.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These foods cause problems in two ways: they loosen the valve at the bottom of the oesophagus (the lower oesophageal sphincter), allowing the stomach contents and acid to rise up, or they directly irritate the oesophagus.</p><img id="i-ac604cef08180e16" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/31/00/3CAD2B5B00000578-0-Eating_late_at_night_can_cause_inflammation_or_put_pressure_on_t-a-42_1485821643510.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Eating late at night can cause inflammation or put pressure on the oesophageal valve, as well as lead to bloating and gassiness" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our lifestyles also play a part. Smoking, eating late at night, rushing our food and being overweight can cause inflammation or put pressure on the oesophageal valve (rushing our meals and eating late can lead to bloating and gassiness). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stress is also implicated, as it triggers the release of hormones that can increase production of gastric acid.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Based on my 27 years' experience treating patients with acid reflux, I've devised a plan to tackle this growing problem, which I set out in my new book, The Acid Watcher Diet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This plan has two stages: a 28-day 'healing' phase, where you avoid foods that trigger acid damage, such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, coffee, peppers, seed oils, chocolate and processed food generally, and choose instead those rich in compounds that help repair the damage, some of which are listed in the box below.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatLHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-be698ce0-e7a4-11e6-8b19-6f195a4c0382">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">DIRTY DOZEN FOODS YOU SHOULD AVOID</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">These are the foods and drinks you must eliminate in the first phase to create a digestive clean slate:</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Fizzy drinks: </strong>Even sparkling water — though not acidic, its bubbles can rise from the stomach, carrying acid</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Coffee and tea</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Citrus fruit</strong>: Any with pH 4 or less, including lemon, lime and pineapple</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Tomato</strong>: This activates and releases pepsin — the enzyme that can eat away and damage throat tissue — but can be neutralised in the second phase</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Vinegar:</strong> All varieties activate pepsin</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Wine:</strong> It is very acidic, measuring from pH 2.9 to pH 3.9</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Caffeine</strong>: Be aware it’s in some painkillers</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Chocolate:</strong> This contains methylxanthine, which increases stomach acid production and is a carminative</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Alcohol: </strong>Vodka and tequila are allowed in the next phase</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Mint</strong>: A powerful carminative, whether as a herb, chewing gum or tea</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Raw onion:</strong> This is a carminative and also a fructan, which means it causes the intestines to absorb water, causing bloating</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Raw garlic:</strong> Also a carminative and a fructan.

This is when the real trouble begins. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once pepsin is planted in your oesophagus, it is activated each time you eat or drink something acidic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As you may recall from your school chemistry lessons, the pH scale runs from 1 to 14 — anything below pH 7 is considered acidic; everything above that is alkaline.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pepsin becomes most active in an environment with a pH level between 1 and 4.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If there are no food proteins for it to break down (as there are in the stomach), the activated pepsin will eat away at the throat and oesophagus, causing problems from inflammation and heartburn to Barrett's oesophagus — and possibly oesophageal cancer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What's especially worrying is that once pepsin gets into your gullet, it floats through the airways and can end up anywhere, including your lungs, where it can cause inflammation and conditions such as asthma and bronchitis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pepsin receptors have been found in the sinuses and middle ears in people with acid reflux. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The concern is that, if activated repeatedly, pepsin can spark inflammation throughout the body.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A key feature of the Acid Watcher diet is that it keeps pepsin in your stomach, where it belongs, and prevents the activation of it outside the stomach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>DITCH CANNED SOUP AND VEG</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The secret is not letting calories, carbohydrates or fat dictate whether a food is 'good' or 'bad': make choices based on a food's acidity or pH value. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A general rule is that the more processed a food, the more acidic it is, due to the chemicals used to preserve it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dietary acid is found in carbonated drinks (sweetened, fizzy drinks can have a pH of 2.5), commercially produced fruit juices and in products containing high-fructose corn syrup (a sweetener made using sulphuric acid), such as biscuits, cakes and ice cream.</p><img id="i-53513264e9d43d09" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/31/00/3CAD2D5E00000578-0-A_general_rule_is_that_the_more_processed_a_food_the_more_acidic-a-45_1485821651553.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="A general rule is that the more processed a food, the more acidic it is, due to the chemicals used to preserve it" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It's even in canned soups and vegetables — especially if they've been pickled or fermented.

Eliminate acid triggers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">2. Rein in your reflux-generating habits — quit smoking completely and cut out processed food. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">3. Avoid fried food — it loosens the oesophageal valve.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">4. Eat three meals, and two mini-meals, at regular intervals between 7am and 7.30pm. This ensures you don't overeat and allows the stomach three hours to digest before lying down, avoiding night-time reflux.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">5. Practise the rule of five: you can eat foods with a pH value of 5 and higher, while pH 4 foods can be introduced in the maintenance phase. These foods will help heal the damage to your oesophagus by keeping pepsin in check.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">6. Introduce more fibre into your diet — it keeps your digestion healthy, reducing reflux. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eat a daily minimum of 450g of vegetables above pH 5 (for example, five medium-sized carrots) — half of which should be raw — and a daily minimum of 225g raw fruit (a handful of cubed cantaloupe with a banana).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One meal a day should be vegetarian to maximise fibre intake.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">7. Drink only water.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">8. Avoid seed oils.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But I've also drawn on over a decade of painstaking examination of scientific literature and dieting advice.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As a doctor, I don't just want you to be thinner (if that's your aim), I want you to be healthy, too. I want you to lose fat, not muscle, and I'd like it to be as easy as possible.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Everyone is different, which is why I have devised a flexible plan that helps you tailor-make a diet that works for your life.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">So my plan offers three options: choose my quick-fix one-meal-a- day solution and lose up to a stone in two weeks; opt for the slower burn of two meals per day, which could strip you of half a stone of unwanted fat in a fortnight; or follow my blueprint for healthy eating, with three meals a day, to take a steady route to reaching your ideal weight and staying there.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Whichever route you choose in the longer term, I suggest beginning with two weeks on just one meal a day to kick-start your weight loss.</font></p><img id="i-d411e0ab6cde1581" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/09/01/3BF81D6F00000578-0-image-a-6_1483926402135.jpg" height="206" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You can use it as a short-term fix to banish the bloat of Christmas excess, and get you firmly on track for healthy eating and sticking to those New Year's resolutions.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Here's the bottom line: if you want to lose weight, you will have to use up more calories than you consume.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You'll need to weigh your portions, work out your daily calorie expenditure (I use myfitnesspal.com — I think it's good) and aim to run a calorie deficit, even though it's hard to be totally accurate when you are calorie counting at home.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">When I started properly thinking about shedding excess weight, I wanted results fast. I love food and have a huge appetite, so I decided the best way to restrict my intake of calories was to limit myself to one good meal a day.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For me, dinner is the most important meal — it's non- negotiable. I love eating with friends and I didn't want to compromise on that.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">So I devised a plan that worked for me. I gave myself a daily calorie allowance of 800, but I bundled all my calories into that one evening meal.

Plan ahead and make them yourself. The best snack of all is an apple with nuts or a small piece of cheese.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Most of us are familiar with the idea of Dry January — giving up alcohol for the month, often in an attempt to make up for the excesses of the Christmas period.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It's a concept popular with medical experts, who are warning that Britain is in the grip of an <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="/news/alcohol/index.html">alcohol</a> epidemic. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">More than ten million Britons drink to harmful levels, regularly exceeding the recommended maximum of 14 units a week (a medium glass of wine is two units, as is a pint of beer), according to a report last month by Public Health England.</font></p><img id="i-d6be1bba62af06a5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/02/22/3BC98EC600000578-0-image-a-1_1483396213439.jpg" height="381" width="634" alt="We asked five brave people who all drink over the official limit — most would be classed as heavy drinkers — to give up alcohol for a month" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And nearly two million of us are thought to be heavy drinkers — defined for women as having more than 35 units (three-and-a-half bottles of wine) a week, or for men, more than 50.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Exceeding limits is easily done — for example, a large glass of wine can equal a third of a bottle — and drinking at this level can leave you with more than just a hangover.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Not only is alcohol high in calories, but heavy drinking contributes to high blood pressure and cholesterol — and probably increases blood sugar levels by making the hormone insulin less effective at processing sugars, raising the risk of Type 2 diabetes.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Plus as the liver breaks down alcohol, it produces toxins that damage cells, leading to inflammation and scarring.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Around 20 per cent of drinkers will develop liver problems that could ultimately prove fatal. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Alcohol also increases the risk of cancer, stroke, dementia and heart disease.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Such is the concern about the number of people with liver damage that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) last month proposed that all heavy drinkers should have a scan to screen for liver disease.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But it's not just the liver that suffers, so too can your sleep, says Professor Kevin Moore, a liver specialist at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Regular drinkers often have impaired sleep because they are more likely to snore or wake more frequently during the night as a consequence of their poor breathing, or because they need to use the bathroom, leaving them with poor concentration during the day,' he says.</font></p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-f949d890-d13f-11e6-b23f-277f2e562a83">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">IS YOUR DRINKING HABIT DAMAGING TO YOUR HEALTH? </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">NICE recently recommended liver scans such as a Fibroscan, which is available on the NHS, for women drinking more than 35 units and men who drink more than 50 units a week. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">If you drink heavily or have done so in the past and are worried, your GP may be able to refer you for assessment. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em;">A liver health check is also available privately at the Royal Free Hospital. </font></p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But is giving up alcohol for a month enough to undo this damage to your body? Experts believe so.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Our recent research on people drinking an average of 35 units a week has shown that going dry for just one month decreases liver stiffness [a sign of liver damage] by 10-15 per cent and leads to significant reductions in weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and insulin resistance,' says Professor Moore. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'So it is well worth it.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">To find out for ourselves, we asked five brave people who all drink over the official limit — most would be classed as heavy drinkers — to give up alcohol for a month.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">They then had their weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels checked, and underwent various other blood tests before and after their alcohol-free month.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Blood tests measuring levels of certain liver enzymes provide important information about how healthy the liver is,' says Professor Moore.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The volunteers also had an ultrasound scan of the liver, known as Fibroscan. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This involves 'flicking' the organ with a vibration sent through the skin to see how the liver responds.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'A wobbly liver (with a score of less than seven) is healthy, while a stiffer liver, with a higher score, is a sign of damage, inflammation and scarring,' he adds.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Here, we reveal our volunteers' surprising results.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>IT FIXED MY HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE </strong></font></p><img id="i-f45597df5a890848" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/02/23/3BC9755700000578-4082714-Gordon_Charlton_pictured_enjoys_a_couple_of_pints_of_beer_after_-a-2_1483398252693.jpg" height="459" width="306" alt="Gordon Charlton (pictured) enjoys a couple of pints of beer after leaving work, then a couple of glasses of wine at home.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">For months Christine Scott battled with inexplicable breathlessness. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">'I struggled to keep up with my family on walks and was breathless and wheezy when I climbed stairs, yet I wasn't a smoker and didn't have asthma,' says Christine, now 64.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">She assumed it couldn't be an animal allergy either, as the family had kept a pet cockatiel, Tweety, for many years.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But it turned out Christine did have a condition caused by her pet — the quaintly-termed 'bird fancier's lung' (BFL) — and it can also be triggered by duvets made of duck and goose down.</font></p><img id="i-ec30bbece8639ef3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/11/07/18/3A27D04300000578-0-Symptoms_of_hypersensitivity_pneumonitis_or_bird_fancier_s_lung_-a-2_1478543901407.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Symptoms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or bird fancier's lung, often go unnoticed for years because the changes are so subtle" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Aside from mild hay fever, I'd never had any breathing difficulty before and couldn't think what could be causing it,' says Christine, who lives in Brackley, Northamptonshire, with her husband Cyril, 65, a retired telecoms engineer. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'It was deeply worrying, but eventually I put it down to being overweight.' Christine, who is 5ft 6in, weighed 15st, although that weight gain pre-dated the wheeziness by years.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But after months of problematic breathing and embarrassed that she couldn't walk up stairs any more without stopping, Christine — who'd previously been reasonably fit and enjoyed walking — finally went to her GP.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He told her it was nothing to worry about and said she should rest. </font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Christine wasn't convinced and used private medical insurance to see a lung specialist. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">After tests, including an MRI, an X-ray, and a bronchoscopy (where a viewing tube was inserted via her nose and down her throat), she was told her lungs were scarred and inflamed.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'When the doctor said my breathing was so bad I had to stay in hospital, I couldn't believe it,' she says.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">After quizzing Christine about her lifestyle the consultant diagnosed an allergy to birds — specifically a protein found in their droppings and feathers.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'He prescribed steroids but said Tweety had to go, which was sad because he'd been a big part of our family for so long,' she says. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'But I knew it was the best thing for my health and we found him a new home at a sanctuary.'</font></p><img

style="font-size:1.2em">Christine thought that if she avoided birds, she would recover.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But after a couple of years of improvement, in 2014 her condition suddenly began to worsen. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'I was breathless on the treadmill and cross-trainer at the gym before I even got started, and I was trailing behind my family on days out,' she says. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'I always had to take the lift rather than the stairs and I was wheezy at night, too.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Her GP referred her for more tests including a chest X-ray which showed significant deterioration in her lungs. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A biopsy revealed fibrosis (stiffening of the tissue) and scarring.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Christine's specialist explained that, although most people with bird allergies get better when they avoid them, her immune system was still reacting as if it was being exposed to Tweety's feathers and droppings even though the cockatoo hadn't lived with them for six years.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Her allergy had led to a condition called hypersensitivity pneumonitis — she had the most common form, bird fancier's lung.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Essentially an allergen causes the alveoli (the small sacs in the lungs) to become inflamed, causing changes to their structure and reducing their ability to move air in and out of the body, which is what causes breathing difficulties.</font></p><img id="i-f64824e7fc45b00b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/11/07/19/3A27F08300000578-0-image-a-26_1478546959742.jpg" height="1413" width="634" alt="Christine's allergy had led to a condition called hypersensitivity pneumonitis — she had the most common form, bird fancier’s lung" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Symptoms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis often go unnoticed for years because the changes are so subtle, explains Stephen Spiro, a professor of respiratory medicine at Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, and medical adviser to the British Lung Foundation. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The condition nibbles away at the lungs and causes them to stiffen over a long period.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'The amount of allergen (in this case avian proteins) needed to cause damage to the lungs is tiny and it happens so slowly, over so many years, that typically people aren't diagnosed until the disease is quite advanced,' he says.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'It usually stops or slows if the bird is removed from the patient's home, but the lungs may be so damaged from past exposure that the full extent of damage is not noticed until it disrupts breathing.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It's not clear why some people develop hypersensitivity and others don't, or why only some people develop serious lung disease because of it. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'In most people inflammation is short-lived and can be controlled by steroids and avoiding the allergen — however, sometimes the only treatment for extensive damage is a lung transplant.</font></p><img

by an undiagnosed allergy to her pet cockatiel 'Tweety'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Up to 20 per cent of pigeon breeders were found to have BFL in a recent study in Salt Lake City in the U.S., although doctors 'don't know why birds seem to cause more of a problem than other animals,' says Professor Spiro.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A similar condition — feather duvet lung — has also been diagnosed in people who have duvets filled with duck or goose down.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Tests showed that Christine's lung function was down to just 33 per cent. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'My specialist told me he was referring me for assessment for a lung transplant,' says Christine, who cried when she realised she had a life-threatening condition.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Doctors could treat the inflammation but couldn't do anything about the scarring, which was getting worse and meant I was vulnerable every time I had a chest infection.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Christine is on a waiting list for a lung transplant and in the mean time is hooked up to a constant supply of oxygen and on strong medication to try to stop any more damage (but which makes her more susceptible to infections for life).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'All of this is because we kept a cockatoo as a pet. I wish now I hadn't ignored my wheeziness and breathlessness for so long and explained them away by saying I was overweight and getting older.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Her story may be extreme but there are many, more common causes of chronic wheezing that shouldn't be ignored.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Wheeziness' is defined as a continuous, coarse whistling sound caused by turbulence in your air flow,' explains Dr James Hull, a consultant respiratory physician at Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'If you're wheezing, some part of the respiratory tract must be narrowed or obstructed, or the speed of air flow affected,' he says, adding that chronic wheeziness needs investigating.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Here we look at some of the most common causes . . .</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>WHEEZING WITH BREATHLESSNESS</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>Could be: Asthma</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The classic symptoms are recurrent attacks of wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing and chest tightness — which happen when the lining of the small airways become inflamed and swollen and the muscles around the airways constrict, reducing the flow of air and in and out of the lungs.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'As asthma is so common ( affecting 5.4 million in the UK) it is often assumed it must be the cause ( of wheezing),' says Dr Hull. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But asthma symptoms can be very similar to symptoms of other lung conditions, so patients need to ensure they're given the right tests to avoid being misdiagnosed.</font></p><img id="i-2237c9ae79957c26"

significant proportion of the patients I see at Royal Brompton, who have been initially diagnosed with asthma, will end up with a different diagnosis,' he adds.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'This is a key reason why NICE is testing the feasibility of a better way of performing diagnostic tests for asthma in general practice.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Tests include spirometry, which involves breathing in as fast as you can through a mouthpiece attached to a machine called a spirometer, which measures the amount of air you can hold in your lungs.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A 'peak flow monitor' can measure how fast you can blow out air from your lungs.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Treatments include daily steroid preventer inhalers to reduce inflammation in the lungs, and reliever inhalers which contain Beta2 agonists to widen the airways.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>BREATHLESSNESS AND A COUGH</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>Could be: Cardiac asthma</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'This isn't asthma at all but a symptom of heart failure,' explains Professor Spiro. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Heart failure is where the heart can't pump blood efficiently around the body — it often occurs following a heart attack and causes fluid to build up around the lungs.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As well as breathlessness with or without wheezing, patients suffer from a chronic cough and rapid shallow breathing. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A common sign is if these symptoms wake you up at night because when you are lying down, adds Professor Spiro.</font></p><img id="i-217c77f0fc91f002"

style="font-size:1.2em">'Blood that normally pools in the legs re-enters the bloodstream and those with heart failure can't cope with the increased volume — resulting in a fluid build-up inside the lungs which affects your ability to breathe.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'It's more common in older people who are most at risk of heart failure, and is usually diagnosed after a patient is admitted to hospital with breathing difficulties at night.' </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Treatments include medication to

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">For ten years Laura Richardson knew that as darkness fell her vision would change. Her eyes would fill with dancing dots that looked like static on a television screen.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">She also found bright light painful. However trips to the optician, GP and an ophthalmologist couldn’t identify any physical problem.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">So she learned to manage the symptoms herself, by installing dimmer lights at home that she kept switched low, and wearing tinted glasses — made for her by an optician — which she wore whenever in bright artificial light.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘I became very depressed and felt that no one truly understood what it was like to see through my eyes,’ says Laura, 30, a counselling student from St Helens in Merseyside.</font></p><img id="i-30edb37bea2650ef" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2016/09/26/21/38B5A40000000578-3808331-image-m-5_1474922987958.jpg" height="733" width="634" alt="For ten years Laura Richardson knew that as darkness fell her vision would change. Her eyes would fill with dancing dots that looked like static on a television screen" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Then last September she woke up one morning to find that the dancing dots were now appearing in daylight, too. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">She could also see ‘after’ images, where for instance, text from a page lingered on her vision.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘It was a huge shock and I was extremely frightened,’ she says. Her GP sent her back to an ophthalmologist but checks — including an MRI scan — came back clear.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It was not until she did her own research that she found out what was wrong: she suffers from visual snow.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As well as seeing ‘static’, the condition can make those affected sensitive to light, explains Peter Goadsby, a professor of neurology at King’s College London and a leading expert in the problem.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He first came across visual snow when, as a migraine specialist, he was being sent patients whose symptoms were being put down to migraine aura. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But he says visual snow is a different and distinct condition. The cause is unclear but brain scans of those affected have found differences in the visual cortex, the area at the back of the brain that processes visual information.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘This area is overactive in people with visual snow and it seems to be a disorder of the way in which this part of the brain responds to the information it receives from the eyes,’ says Professor Goadsby.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘For those affected it can be extremely disabling and affect their work and personal lives.’</font></p><img id="i-80b390251d34ee21" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2016/09/26/21/38B5A51D00000578-3808331-image-m-10_1474923072971.jpg" height="724" width="634" alt=" Laura Richardson suffers from visual snow. This means that her eyes fill with dancing dots that looked like static on a television screen" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As well as the psychological and social impact, the problem has affected Laura in more practical ways — she has to limit use of her phone and laptop, for instance, as these aggravate the symptoms, ‘which has made studying difficult,’ she says.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">At the moment there is no cure. Professor Goadsby is working on finding an effective treatment but says people who think they have have the condition should visit their optician or GP to rule out other problems that can cause strange eye symptoms.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But visual snow is not the only eye condition that can make you see things, as the experts explain.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>HALLUCINATIONS</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">People with impaired sight often have hallucinations — seeing things or people that aren’t there.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘They are caused by the brain responding to the loss of visual input to the eye,’ says Dominic ffytche, a reader in visual psychiatry at King’s College London.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘The nerves in the visual area of the brain become hyperexcitable, and fire off spontaneously, leading to the hallucinations.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Many of those affected do not mention it, fearing they have mental health problems (or dementia) but the phenomenon is a recognised medical condition called Charles Bonnet syndrome.</font></p><img id="i-121bbbeaca149571" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2016/09/26/22/38D1EA2E00000578-3808331-image-a-11_1474925830169.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="People with impaired sight often have hallucinations — seeing things or people that aren’t there. They are caused by the brain responding to the loss of visual input to the eye" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It affects about 10 per cent of people with moderately impaired eyesight, perhaps due to cataracts (where the lens becomes cloudy) and glaucoma (when pressure builds up in the eye damaging the optic nerve), although in fact anyone who can’t see from about halfway down a standard eye test letter chart can develop it.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The hallucinations will range from coloured blobs and patterns to faces, figures and animals. About 20 per cent of patient with Charles Bonnet see people in elaborate costume.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘The hallucinations are not memories of visual experiences stored in the brain, so the faces or figures are not familiar and they have no direct relevance to the person experiencing them,’ explains Dr ffytche.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The hallucinations generally develop within weeks of the vision loss, and generally reduce over the following 18 months as the brain adapts to the loss of sight.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Altering the light levels either up or down, or a series of specific eye movements can help, it is thought, by activating the under used visual parts of the brain that cause the hallucinations. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Some medications for epilepsy, dementia and psychosis can reduce hallucinations by dampening over activity in the nerves of the brain, but carry the risk of significant side -effects.</font></p><img id="i-4c17b55651be30a1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2016/09/26/22/38D2525700000578-3808331-image-a-17_1474926713842.jpg" height="425" width="634" alt="Hallucinations due to Charles Bonnet syndrome  will range from coloured blobs and patterns to faces, figures and animals" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Other conditions can cause visual hallucinations such as dementia and Parkinsons’s disease. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In this case it is thought to be due to a lack of the brain chemical acetylcholine, which plays a role in visual processing and here the hallucinations tend to be figures and animals that are more likely to be familiar than those that occur in Charles Bonnet syndrome.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Anyone with hallucinations should go and see their GP, although knowledge of the syndrome can be limited so it can be worth taking along a leaflet about it to the appointment,’ says Dr ffytche.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>FLOATERS AND FLASHES OF LIGHT</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Many people have floaters, dots or lines that trail across their vision. These are caused by strands of collagen in the vitreous, the jelly-like substance that fills the eyeball. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This collagen can deteriorate naturally with age and bits break off and float across the line of vision.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But a sudden influx of new floaters in the vision, especially if accompanied by flashes of light can be a sign of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This occurs when the gel in the eye becomes more watery, normally as a result of ageing; the gel shrinks and tugs at the retina, the thin layer of light sensitive cells at the back of the eye which send visual information to the brain.</font></p><img id="i-5129a937b1b18f31" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2016/09/26/22/38D2487300000578-3808331-image-a-14_1474926139692.jpg" height="238" width="306" alt="Many people have floaters, dots or lines that trail across their vision. These are caused by strands of collagen in the vitreous" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As the gel tugs at the retina it can release floaters, and stimulates the light sensitive cells, hence flashes of light appear in the vision.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Floaters can also be a sign that the retina has torn or pulled away from the back of the eye, which without prompt treatment can lead to a partial or total loss of sight.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘The flashing lights in PVD are generally seen in dim light whilst in a retinal tear or detachment, they are brighter and can generally be seen in normal light,’ says Professor Stephen Vernon, a consultant ophthalmologist at University Hospital Nottingham.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A patient can’t reliably detect between the two so should see an optometrist or visit an eye A&amp;E, ideally within 24 hours of the symptoms starting. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Retinal tears can be treated with a laser as an outpatient, whereas a retinal detachment will require an operation to reattach the retina.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>HALOS</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Seeing halos around lights can be a sign cataracts are developing. They occur when the usually clear cells of the lens become cloudy, due to changes in the consistency and volume of the proteins in them. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This alters the way light travels through the lens so that lights can appear to have halos.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Professor Vernon explains that halos can be an early symptom of cataracts.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Cataracts are more common in people over 60, particularly if the patient has diabetes,’ he says.</font></p><img id="i-983c9bfcc6af436c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2016/09/26/22/38D24C5F00000578-3808331-image-a-15_1474926404387.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Seeing halos around lights can be a sign cataracts are developing.

I had another problem with similar symptoms, but a very different solution (and might help explain why someone’s acid reflux pills don’t work).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But it took numerous doctors, tests, drugs and joyless (and ultimately fruitless) changes to diet and lifestyle to reach this conclusion.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The first step in this lengthy journey was a prescription for omeprazole.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) which reduces the amount of acid produced in the stomach.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">After two months of taking it nothing had changed, except by now I felt burning in my throat and kept losing my voice in the morning. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">At this point, I started worrying. I knew that trouble swallowing, persistent sore throat and a hoarse voice are all red flags for throat and oesophageal cancer.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I also knew that long-term acid reflux can damage the oesophagus lining, which can itself raise your cancer risk. I was only 47 and a non-smoker, so I made another doctor’s appointment.</font></p><img id="i-c31e6615431b2204" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/01/22/36C8BB2200000578-3718535-Helen_Foster_thought_she_had_acid_reflux_for_two_years_but_had_r-a-19_1470088017059.jpg" height="772" width="634" alt="Helen Foster thought she had acid reflux for two years, but had received the wrong diagnosis" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This time she referred me for an endoscopy, where a camera is used to examine the throat.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">To my great relief, although my throat was red and irritated, nothing sinister was detected. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The consultant confirmed the reflux diagnosis and put me on a different PPI called lansoprazole, a slightly higher dose. It didn’t work either.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Various drugs were prescribed over the next year, including Zantac, which reduces acid a different way, and the antacid Gaviscon, which prevents acid from rising up.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">These failed to make any difference to my symptoms. And the various lifestyle changes that I dutifully implemented only made my life miserable.</font></p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="4e73f690-581c-11e6-b940-1f766affb9a5">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> This sounds so simple, but ends up controlling your life.

Mr Reddy began by asking how I knew I had reflux.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Endoscopy,’ I replied, only for him to say: ‘That doesn’t necessarily prove it.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Then, to my surprise, he revealed there are at least four other conditions that can cause the same symptoms as acid reflux, but which don’t respond to reflux medication.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Drugs for acid reflux are generally very effective so if a patient tells me they aren’t working, I have to suspect it’s not stomach acid causing their problem,’ says Mr Reddy, who also works at the St George’s University Hospital NHS Trust.</font></p><img id="i-adb89b9650efe5bc" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/01/22/36C8E42F00000578-3718535-Dr_Marcus_Reddy_says_drugs_for_acid_reflux_are_generally_very_ef-a-22_1470088032806.jpg" height="459" width="306" alt="Dr Marcus Reddy says drugs for acid reflux are generally very effective, and that patients should contact a doctor if symptoms preside" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Mr Reddy then referred me for a test called 24-Hour PH manometry. This two-pronged investigation would double check whether I had acid reflux and also help detect other problems that could be masquerading as it.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Part one took 45 minutes. It involved sitting upright while a thin wire containing pressure sensors was passed through my nose, down my throat (numbed with anaesthetic) and into my stomach.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Then I was fed water and bread to make me swallow, so that the contractions of my gullet would press on the sensors.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Poor contractions can indicate achalasia — one of the four problems that can pass for reflux. Achalasia is where the gullet loses its ability to move food along due to a problem with nerves in its wall. ‘This causes food, saliva and oesophageal juices to build up causing irritation,’ explains Mr Reddy.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The pressure-sensor test also checks whether the valve into the stomach is working. With acid reflux, this valve opens too often. But sometimes the opposite happens and the valve does not open enough, so that food fails to descend into the stomach as it should.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This may be related to achalasia or, rarely, growths. Ironically, it can also be caused by previous reflux, because this can cause tissues around the valve to thicken — known as a stricture — preventing the valve opening properly.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Whatever the cause, the consequence is an irritating build-up of food in the throat.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The first tube was then removed and, for part two, a thinner one was inserted via my nose where it would remain for 24 hours. Thankfully, I was only conscious of it when I swallowed. I was sent home so it could monitor my stomach and throat.</font></p><img id="i-c6602479a8424d66" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/01/22/36C8ECCD00000578-3718535-Acid_reflux_can_be_a_life_altering_condition_as_many_sufferers_h-a-23_1470088038123.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Acid reflux can be a life-altering condition, as many sufferers have to change their lifestyles" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Its purpose was to check the acidity in my stomach, and whether acid was reaching my throat.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If everything is normal on the acid front, it can indicate the third problem that may cause reflux symptoms: bile acid.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Because of a faulty muscle and valve bile acid can escape from the duodenum into the stomach and into the oseophagus.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Bile acid is actually alkaline and so acid suppressing drugs won’t act on it — but it’s very corrosive to the oesophagus,’ says Mr Reddy.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And if these two tests were negative, I might have the fourth potential cause of symptoms — slow gastric motility, where the stomach empties too slowly, causing pressure to build and force open the stomach valve, so its contents spill upwards.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">My investigation revealed a problem with the valve going into my stomach — it wasn’t that acid was splashing up, but food wasn’t going down properly, so some was sticking in my oesophagus. The technical name was disturbed oesophageal motility.</font></p><img id="i-22a9ee29325b764a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/01/22/36C9090400000578-3718535-Disturbed_oesophageal_motility_is_where_some_of_the_food_sticks_-a-24_1470088062721.jpg" height="582" width="634" alt="Disturbed oesophageal motility is where some of the food sticks in the gullet, causing irritation" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘I test about 1,000 patients a year in this exact same situation,’ says gastroenterologist Dr Anton Emmanuel from University College Hospital, London. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Of those, probably 30 to 40 have a problem with disturbed motility of the oesophagus — the others are a mix of the other problems, or they do have reflux but simply don’t respond well to the drugs and need surgery instead.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But there may be many more with these problems who have simply never been tested, he says.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Reflux is enormously common.

It is a $13 billion-a-year industry in the US. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Nine out of 10 boys in America are exposed to it before the age of 18, and men are 543 per cent more likely to be users than women. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">By 2017, over a quarter of a billion people will use mobile porn sites worldwide.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">With such an enormous audience, it is not possible to make generalisations about whether internet pornography is good or bad. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Clearly, it's a matter of perspective. Reviews have linked pornography consumption with positive effects such as increased sexual knowledge and more liberal sexual attitudes. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But how does it shape our intimate relationships?</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">British Prime Minister David Cameron has expressed concern that internet pornography could be warping ideas about sex and relationships, and scientific evidence in this area tends to support his view. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Links between pornography consumption and intimate relationship problems (although data typically refer to heterosexual, monogamous relationships) are well established.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Pornography consumption has been associated with increased marital distress, risk of separation, decreased romantic intimacy and sexual satisfaction, a higher chance of infidelity, and compulsive or addictive sexual behaviour. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">However, this does not automatically imply that internet pornography causes relational difficulties. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Pornography consumption may equally be caused by them.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But if consumption does dampen romantic intimacy then it will be important to understand how. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Harvard Psychology Professor Deirdre Barrett has suggested that internet pornography is a version of what scientists call a 'supernormal stimulus'. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That is, an artificial exaggeration of the environmental factors from which we have naturally evolved to become sexually aroused.</font></p><img id="i-907b1fd4bf19301d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/07/15/360AEA4B00000578-3679067-image-a-22_1467901949232.jpg" height="403" width="634" alt="Studies have also documented a deep rooted breakdown in trust and attachment, as partners frequently feel pornography consumption is a deceptive form of betrayal and infidelity" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Instinctive behaviour across a range of species can be hijacked when researchers create supernormal versions of normal stimuli. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For example, while a female bird's natural instinct is to nurture her small, speckled eggs, she will abandon them when presented with the option of larger, more heavily patterned artificial exaggerations of her eggs. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Over time, she will lose interest completely in the normal eggs, as though her instinct towards them has been overridden by the supernormal ones.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In a similar (but more complex) way, internet pornography offers users a supernormal sexual experience. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">On one level, they become aroused by watching supernormal bodies having supernormal sex. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">On another level, they become accustomed to selecting these supernormal, virtual experiences from seemingly infinite options and have the possibility to refine, replay, pause, and rewind these virtual sexual experiences at will.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A major concern for sex and relationship therapists and researchers is that real people's responses to real sex can indeed be dampened by overexposure to virtual sex. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In his TED Talk, The Great Porn Experiment, Gary Wilson discusses arguments and evidence in support of porn induced erectile dysfunction. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He highlights issues such as a numbed pleasure response and addictive craving for 'hits' of pornographic material in heavy users.</font></p><img id="i-3200db0b5ec6d357" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/07/15/360AF42400000578-3679067-image-a-23_1467901974813.jpg" height="425" width="634" alt="Former British Prime Minister David Cameron expressed concern that internet pornography could be warping ideas about sex and relationships with scientific evidence tending to support his view" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The ways in which family life can be affected by these issues can be very powerful, too. A paper by sex therapist, Paula Hall, outlines the following typical case.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><span class="mol-style-italic">Tim was a 36-year-old man, married with two children aged one and three. </span></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><span class="mol-style-italic">He initially presented with erectile dysfunction but detailed assessment revealed that he had no problems with erections to pornography which he was now accessing most evenings for three or four hours at a time.</span></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><span class="mol-style-italic">He was very aware that his pornography use was getting in the way of him having sex with his wife and realised he'd got himself into a Catch 22. </span></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><span class="mol-style-italic">Watching increasingly hard-core porn was making him feel numb when having sex with his wife, but because sex with his wife was now so difficult, he was watching even more porn. </span></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><span class="mol-style-italic">In fact, the only times he could get an erection with his wife now was if he fantasised about porn which left him feeling guilty and distant from her.</span></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">Dampened responses to normal sex can result in intense feelings of guilt for users when sex with their partner isn't as arousing as supernormal sex. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">There can also be attempts by users to make normal sex supernormal, either through fantasy or by manipulating reality.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Studies have also documented a deep rooted breakdown in trust and attachment, connected to the fact that partners frequently experience pornography consumption as a deceptive form of betrayal and infidelity. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In the above study, one wife described her husband's use of pornography as indiscriminate, virtual philandering and said that she felt like 'he's had a million affairs'.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Ultimately, as cultural anthropologist, Mizuko Ito, has suggested: 'We have created these technologies but it's not obvious how they evolve in and shape our culture.' </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Paradoxically, as connecting as technology may be, it is vital that we also understand and debate its role in creating and exacerbating disconnection.</font></p><div class="mol-html" id="b99a9de0-444c-11e6-b9a6-fff8145900ec">                            <div><img alt="The Conversation" height="1" src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/61451/count.gif" width="1" /></div>                        </div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Sam Carr, lecturer in education from the University of Bath, argues porn increases sexual knowledge and makes people more sexually open-minded about trying different things.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Anna Hodgekiss</dc:creator><dc:modified>2016-07-10T21:16:29.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Is internet porn ruining your relationship?</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2016-07-10T21:16:29.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3677764/Trying-baby-Don-t-pressure-hubby-sex-Pinpointing-fertile-day-passion-killer-lead-performance-anxiety.html" title="Trying for a baby?

Across couples, it was 5.4 minutes (file photo)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em">If you're a non-scientist, you might have once asked yourself, propped against the bedhead after disappointingly quick intercourse, how long does sex 'normally' last?</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A scientist, though, would phrase the same question in an almost comically obscure way: What is the mean intravaginal ejaculation latency time?</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I know there's a lot more to sex than putting the penis into the vagina and ejaculating, but the rest is not always easy to define (kissing? rubbing? grinding?). </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">To keep things simple and specific, we'll just focus on the time to ejaculation.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Measuring an average time to ejaculation is not a straightforward matter. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">What about just asking people how long they take, you say? </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Well, there are two main problems with this. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">One is that people are likely to be biased upwards in their time estimates, because it's socially desirable to say you go long into the night.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The other problem is that people don't necessarily know how long they go for. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Sex isn't something people normally do while monitoring the bedside clock, and unassisted time measuring may be difficult during a spontaneous lovemaking session.</font></p><img id="i-594d014d36e1acfd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/04/04/11/32D5C7E300000578-3522596-image-a-8_1459766282019.jpg" height="427" width="634" alt="Studies show penetration can last from 33 seconds to 44 minutes long when an average is taken of all the times a couple has sex - an 80-fold difference (file photo)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><span class="mol-style-large health-ccox"><strong>WHAT DOES THE RESEARCH SAY? </strong></span></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The best study we have estimating the average time to ejaculation in the general population involved 500 couples from around the world timing themselves having sex over a four-week period – using a stopwatch.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That is as practically awkward as it sounds: participants pressed 'start' at penile penetration and 'stop' at ejaculation. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You may note this could affect the mood somewhat, and might perhaps not exactly reflect the natural flow of things. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But science is rarely perfect, and this is the best we've got.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">So what did the researchers find? </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The most striking result is that there was a huge amount of variation. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The average time for each couple (that is, averaged across all the times they had sex) ranged from 33 seconds to 44 minutes. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That's an 80-fold difference. </font></p><img id="i-1b97fce646605ccf" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/04/04/11/32D5BD7800000578-3522596-image-a-9_1459766286006.jpg" height="610" width="634" alt="Condom use didn't seem to affect the time spent having sex, nor did a man being circumcised " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">So it's clear there's no one 'normal' amount of time to have sex. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The average (median, technically) across all couples, though, was 5.4 minutes. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This means that if you line up the 500 couples from shortest sex to longest sex, the middle couple goes for an average of 5.4 minutes each time they do it.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">There were some interesting secondary results, too. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For example, condom use didn't seem to affect the time, and neither did men's being circumcised or not.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This challenges some conventional wisdom regarding penile sensitivity and its relationship to staying power in the sack.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It didn't much matter which country the couples came from either – unless they came from Turkey, in which case their sex tended to be significantly shorter (3.7 minutes) than couples from other countries (Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Another surprising finding was that the older the couple, the shorter the sex, contrary to the prevailing wisdom (probably peddled by older men).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><span class="mol-style-large health-ccox"><strong>WHY DO WE HAVE SEX FOR SO LONG?</strong></span> </font></p><img id="i-f9ce77794fca7bef" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/04/04/11/32D5CA7D00000578-3522596-image-a-10_1459766290060.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="The older the couple, the shorter the sex. This is contrary to the prevailing wisdom, probably peddled by older men, that they last longer, Dr Zietsch said (file photo)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As an evolutionary researcher, all this talk of how long sex lasts make me wonder: 'Why does it last any time at all?'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">All sex really needs to achieve, it seems, is to put sperm into the vagina. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Why all the thrusting and bumping? Instead of sliding the penis in and out many hundreds of times per sexual session, why not just put it in once, ejaculate, and then go have a lemonade and get on with the rest of the day?</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Before you say, 'because it's fun to go in and out', remember evolution doesn't care about fun per se – it generally only 'designs' things to be enjoyable if they helped our ancestors pass on their genes to future generations. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For example, even though we like eating food, we don't chew each mouthful of it for five minutes just to make the enjoyment last longer. </font></p><img id="i-23f0489e4d198b73" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/04/04/11/32D5BF5B00000578-3522596-image-a-11_1459766294613.jpg" height="397" width="634" alt="Dr Zietsch explained the evolutionary reason why we engage in lengthy penetration may be because  the ridge of a penis scoops out existing sperm from the vagina. This allows that particular man's sperm to reach the egg" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That would be inefficient, and so we've evolved to find it gross.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Why we last so long is a pretty complicated question with no clear answer, but a clue may be in the way the penis is shaped. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In 2003, researchers showed – using artificial vaginas, artificial penises, and artificial sperm (corn syrup) – that the ridge around the head of the penis actually scoops out pre-existing syrup from the vagina.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">What this suggests is that men's repeated thrusting might function to displace other men's semen before ejaculating, ensuring their own swimmers have a better chance of reaching the egg first. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Incidentally, this could explain why it becomes painful for a man to continue thrusting after ejaculating, since that would risk scooping out his own semen as well.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">So what to do with this information? My advice would be to try not to think about it during the throes of passion.</font></p><div class="mol-html">

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Crumpled over my desk, I fought to keep my eyes open as another sudden wave of nausea washed over me. Pinching my arm, I willed myself not to pass out.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Ten minutes earlier I’d blacked out in a toilet cubicle — exhausted after throwing up for the fifth time in a row. The previous day I’d fainted on a train.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Somewhere in the background I heard the muffled voice of my new boss asking if I was OK. I was far from OK — I hadn’t been able to keep a morsel of food down for the past three days. Even the thought of sipping water made my stomach turn.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">What could I say to her? If I told her the truth — that this was how I am before I get my period — would she believe me? ‘Surely it can’t be that bad?’ people would often say when I tried to explain the problems that plagued me each month.</font></p><img id="i-331fd45ba3224b8f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/21/19/326F696600000578-3503134-image-a-5_1458589439524.jpg" height="1341" width="634" alt="Monthly torment: Nilufer Atik was diagnosed with PMDD, or premenstrual dysphoric disorder, which is a severe and disabling form of premenstrual syndrome" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I have PMDD — premenstrual dysphoric disorder, a severe and disabling form of premenstrual syndrome.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Rather than the odd cramp, or feeling a bit teary, PMDD can be completely incapacitating. As well as physical symptoms — nausea, headaches and abdominal pain, extreme fatigue, insomnia and fainting — PMDD comes with psychological symptoms, too: violent mood swings, depression, suicidal thoughts, boiling anger, feeling out of control and trouble thinking clearly.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It can damage friendships, stall your career and ruin relationships. I speak from experience: my partner of seven years was unable to take the strain of it, and we broke up shortly after I was diagnosed.</font></p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS">
                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> While the exact cause of PMDD is not known, it is thought to be linked to an increased sensitivity to the natural changes in hormone levels around this time — particularly progesterone.</div>
                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘These symptoms can lead to a breakdown in interpersonal relationships and to an interference with normal activities,’ says Nick Panay, a consultant gynaecologist at Queen Charlotte’s and Chelsea Hospital, London, and chairman of the National Association of Premenstrual Syndrome.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘I know a patient whose children were taken away because of her symptoms.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Symptoms usually begin the week before a period, then, as in the case of PMS, go away once it starts. While the exact cause of PMDD is not known, it is thought to be linked to an increased sensitivity to the natural changes in hormone levels around this time — particularly progesterone.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Levels of progesterone rise after ovulation each month in preparation for potential pregnancy (the hormone helps to maintain the lining of the womb, among other things).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">However, if the egg released goes unfertilised, progesterone levels start to drop again about a week after ovulation, and continue to fall until menstruation begins, about a week after that.</font></p><img id="i-95101e87fe03f69" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/21/19/326F696A00000578-3503134-image-m-10_1458589610741.jpg" height="717" width="634" alt="More common than people think: PMDD is thought to affect 8 per cent of women who get premenstrual symptoms — but it may be much many more..." class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-790498ed883b6350" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/21/19/326F695A00000578-3503134-image-a-9_1458589515130.jpg" height="1060" width="634" alt="Testing: Nilufer reveals that rather than the odd cramp, PMDD can be completely incapacitating" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This is known as the luteal phase. Oestrogen also drops during this time, which can have a knock-on effect on levels of serotonin — the ‘feelgood’ chemical in the brain.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Decreasing levels of serotonin can lead to low mood as well as physical symptoms (serotonin is also found in the digestive tract, for example, which may be why PMDD causes nausea).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It’s not that women with PMDD have different hormone levels from other women. Instead it’s believed that they react differently to what is a normal monthly fluctuation —that the problem is down to malfunction in how their hormones ‘talk’ to the rest of the body.</font></p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS">

                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For instance, studies have shown that in women with PMDD, during the luteal phase there is increased activity in the hippocampus, the emotional centre of the brain, which could explain the anxiety, depression and irritability.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It may also be that fluctuating hormone levels as women age trigger PMDD, when they’ve previously had no problems.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This is what happened to me. Before my 30s, while I’d get the odd mild cramp a few days before my period, it was nothing a few over-the-counter painkillers wouldn’t fix.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Then, after I turned 32, everything changed. First came the extreme nausea. It would begin around ten days beforehand and even the smell of dry toast would make me retch.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Then, two days later, the depression would hit — a deep feeling of hopelessness that would plunge me into a pit of despair. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><img id="i-901fc403e76a00d0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/21/20/326F824E00000578-3503134-image-a-11_1458591907609.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Physical manifestations: Symptoms can include nausea, extreme fatigue, insomnia and fainting, plus violent mood swings, depression and suicidal thoughts" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I would fly into uncontrollable rages over the slightest thing. Once, before I was diagnosed, my then partner, Adam, and I were driving when he took a wrong turn.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I screamed at him and lashed out, slapping him on the leg. It was a huge overreaction and I felt so guilty and ashamed afterwards.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Some days, the pain and nausea would leave me bed-bound. But as soon as my period started, my symptoms would vanish. This is typical of PMDD sufferers, according to Professor John Studd, a consultant gynaecologist who has set up a specialist PMDD clinic at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Women often describe having a Jekyll and Hyde-type personality,’ he says.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This cyclical nature of such symptoms is the key sign that distinguishes PMDD from other mental health conditions — though they are often confused. PMDD is thought to affect 8 per cent of women who get premenstrual symptoms — but it may be that many more are affected and go undiagnosed.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘It is a much bigger problem than we realise,’ says Professor Studd. ‘Because the emotional symptoms, such as a low mood, insomnia, and anxiety are often similar to those presented in depressive illness, many doctors confuse the two.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Sufferers get a few days of sheer hell when they feel extremely irritable, exhausted, tearful, depressed and anxious, and then, once menstruation has occurred, their symptoms subside.</font></p><img id="i-583b2660ab3f3da9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/21/20/326F695600000578-3503134-image-m-13_1458592839170.jpg" height="962" width="634" alt="Intense: Sufferers get a few days of sheer hell when they feel extremely irritable, exhausted, tearful, depressed and anxious, and then, once menstruation has occurred, their symptoms subside" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘This is how we know it is an endocrinological (hormonal) disorder, and not psychiatric. It’s a very important distinction.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Six years ago, aged 35, I went to see my GP and was prescribed a mild dose of the anti-depressant citalopram. But my instincts told me I wasn’t depressed — after all, depression didn’t explain the blackouts and nausea.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I had an inkling that my symptoms were linked to my periods, because the black cloud would lift the second they started. But when I suggested this to my GP, he’d just tell me it was psychological or that I had a low pain threshold.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Over the next couple of years, I saw many different GPs who prescribed various pills to treat the individual symptoms. Although no one ever diagnosed PMDD, they tried me on different contraceptive pill combinations, to ‘regulate’ my hormones. I was also given the Mirena coil (which releases progesterone slowly in the womb). But none helped — if anything, I felt worse.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I was also misdiagnosed with endometriosis (where womb-like tissue grows elsewhere in the body, causing pain and inflammation) and in 2010 and underwent unnecessary investigative keyhole surgery.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">By the age of 37, I’d had enough. I was taking a worrying concoction of prescription painkillers and anti-sickness drugs as well as anti-inflammatories for two weeks every month just to try to manage my symptoms. I hated the zombie-like effect they had, and they didn’t even work.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Through my research, I discovered Professor Studd, who put me on a course of HRT. He says the key is suppressing ovulation. For this reason, both the Mirena coil and the Pill can help, although they didn’t work for me. A hysterectomy can be a permanent solution — though only if the ovaries are removed as well.</font></p><img id="i-88bba9c8ae9219da" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/21/20/326F7FC800000578-3503134-image-a-12_1458591937386.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="'Some days, the pain and nausea would leave me bed-bound.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">LAID low with a fever, chills, dizziness and muffled hearing, 36-year-old Stewart Armstrong assumed he was suffering from a bad bout of flu.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Two weeks later, with no sign of improvement — and under pressure from his partner, Janine — the businessman went to see his GP. The doctor could find nothing obviously wrong and prescribed pills to combat the dizziness.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Blood test results also offered no answers. But the day after seeing his GP, Stewart started coughing up clots of blood.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In fact, Stewart had aspergillosis, a fungal infection in his lung, although it would take many months before he would finally get the treatment he needed.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Aspergillosis is the umbrella name for conditions caused by the common mould aspergillus fumigatus.</font></p><img id="i-816315fac58562ef" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/15/20/313DD1DC00000578-3448403-image-m-2_1455567880751.jpg" height="682" width="634" alt="Hidden danger: Aspergillosis is the umbrella name for conditions caused by the mould aspergillus fumigatus" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The mould gives off microscopic particles — spores — that are extremely light and float easily in the air. This is how the mould proliferates (when the spores germinate, they develop into full-grown green and white fungus) and, if inhaled, can cause infection.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Aspergillus spores are found all around us, indoors and outside. The mould is common in rotting leaves and compost, as well as in air-conditioning units and heating systems, and in insulation material in walls and lofts.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Like other moulds, it thrives in warm, damp environments. For this reason it can be found in bathrooms and kitchens (although it’s not what causes the black spots of mould often visible in these rooms).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A small 2005 study by the University of Manchester, published in the journal Allergy, suggested that most normal household pillows will have aspergillus growing in them — possibly because it feeds off dust mite faeces.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The mould most commonly causes allergic reactions, triggering symptoms such as wheezing and coughing. This is a particular problem in people with asthma, exacerbating symptoms in one in 40 people. But it can also cause a long-term, incurable infection in the lungs known as chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, which not only causes symptoms such as a severe cough and shortness of breath, but also fatigue and weight-loss.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If left untreated, it can cause serious and potentially fatal damage to the lungs — as Stewart would discover.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Stewart believes he may have been exposed to an especially heavy concentration of aspergillus when he pulled down a ceiling during home refurbishments several years ago — though specialists say it is impossible to say for sure.</font></p><img id="i-9a05080182582478" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/15/20/30FDC91400000578-3448403-image-a-3_1455567935971.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="Spores: The mould gives off microscopic particles that are extremely light and, if inhaled, can cause infection" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Most people’s immune systems will be able to destroy the spores they inhale, but those with existing lung problems — such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma — or who have had previous lung surgery or a collapsed lung, are more vulnerable.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Several years before, Stewart had been diagnosed with sarcoidosis — an auto-immune disease that causes patches of raw and inflamed tissue, usually on the lungs and skin — and this put him at risk.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The problem is, aspergillosis infection is not necessarily on the radar of many health professionals so may not be spotted. Officially, chronic pulmonary aspergillosis affects up to just 700 people a year, though some experts believe the actual number affected is ten times higher.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">After Stewart started coughing up blood, he called his sister, Claire, a nurse, and on her advice took himself off to A&amp;E near his home in Ramsgate, Kent.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The hospital referred him to the specialist he’d seen for his sarcoidosis, who in turn referred him for a CT scan at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">While he waited for the results —which would take several weeks — Stewart became steadily more poorly, with ongoing flu-like symptoms, weight loss and a severe cough. He was housebound and unable to work.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The scan results revealed a fungal ball about the size of a 10p in his left lung — which Stewart now knows was an aspergilloma, a ball of aspergillus fungus, though he says no one mentioned aspergillosis at this stage, only that it could be some kind of fungal infection.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He was prescribed anti-fungal itraconazole tablets (sometimes used to treat thrush) and returned home. But he then suffered an allergic reaction to the drug, had a seizure and was taken to hospital in an ambulance.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He was advised to come off the itraconazole, which he did. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><img id="i-547677e8bb0f1f1b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/15/20/313E602900000578-3448403-image-a-8_1455568904436.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Unpleasant! A 2005 study by the University of Manchester suggested that most normal household pillows will have aspergillus growing in them — possibly because it feeds off dust mite faeces" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Anxious for an alternative — and, he says, not offered one by his new specialist in London — he did his own research online and came across the National Aspergillosis Centre (NAC), the only one of its kind in the world, attached to the University Hospital of South Manchester.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Two weeks later, Stewart saw a consultant at the centre and was diagnosed with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. As well as the fungal ball in one lung, there was aspergillus fungus living in cavities (holes) in his lungs, which his doctors believe were, in all likelihood, previous injuries caused by his sarcoidosis.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">An aspergillosis infection in the lungs can only be managed, not cured, usually with long-term antifungal medication, and a growing fungal ball can cause inflammation and tissue damage, which requires surgery either to remove the ball itself or to remove lung tissue.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Stewart’s infection was eating into his lungs and stimulating new blood vessels to form, which was causing the lungs to bleed. But there was more bad news. The consultant said that if treatment with alternative anti-fungal medication didn’t work, Stewart ‘could have 12 to 18 months to live’.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘I had a seven-hour train ride home to digest the news,’ says Stewart. ‘I just couldn’t believe it. I was 35 and they were telling me I’m going to be killed by an incurable fungus, a condition you never hear about anywhere. I just felt extremely isolated.’ </font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Unfortunately, Stewart suffered a severe allergic reaction to his new medication, so he came off it and returned to the NAC a couple of months later to meet Professor David Denning, a world expert on fungal diseases and the driving force behind the centre’s establishment.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Professor Denning prescribed a dual approach.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">To stop the bleeding, Stewart would need an embolisation, where small plastic beads are injected into the new blood vessels, blocking them. The procedure would deprive the fungus of a food supply, as it feeds off the blood leaking from these arteries.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Professor Denning also prescribed posaconazole, a relatively new anti–fungal treatment. It’s expensive — £26,000 a year — and the NAC is the only centre that can prescribe the drug for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. It works by slowing the growth of fungi.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Stewart began the treatment last June, six months after his first symptoms. Thankfully, he suffered no adverse reaction to the drugs and the embolisation seems to have stopped the bleeding. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><img id="i-2056393362e2e4dc" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/15/20/313E603400000578-3448403-image-a-7_1455568858603.jpg" height="630" width="634" alt="Signs: The mould most commonly causes allergic reactions, triggering symptoms such as wheezing" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Scans show that the infected areas have shrunk, although the fungal ball remains unchanged, and its size and location means it cannot be removed by surgery.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Stewart will have to stay on the posaconazole or some variant of it for the rest of his life. He says he feels noticeably better, has put on weight and is much less tired. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Yet the impact on his life cannot be underestimated, as he cannot afford to get ill. He has had air filters and dehumidifiers installed in his home to clean the air of fungal spores and remove the moisture that they require to survive.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He no longer travels by plane because of the risk of air contaminants, and he has his house cleaned three times a week.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Exactly why some people are vulnerable to CPA is not clear, but Professor Denning says the current thinking is that it’s down to a combination of an existing lung complaint, genetics and exposure to the aspergillus fungus.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He is concerned that not enough GPs, or even respiratory nurses, are ‘thinking enough about the fungal complications that can arise as a result of chronic respiratory disease or lung injuries’.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">There is a blood test, the precipitin blood test, that can detect the presence of aspergillosis antibodies, which is available to all GPs and hospitals. <strong> </strong></font></p><img id="i-10633a858743f4d4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/15/20/313E602100000578-3448403-image-a-5_1455568841672.jpg" height="464" width="634" alt="Chronic condition: An aspergillosis infection in the lungs can only be managed, not cured, usually with long-term antifungal medication" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But because it is generally considered a ‘rare’ disease, says Professor Denning, too often such tests are simply not requested. Instead, patients are offered a ‘standard’ blood test to check for things like anaemia or liver or thyroid abnormalities — but this won’t spot aspergillosis.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">No one can give Stewart an exact prognosis. For now, he and Janine, 28, are planning their wedding and he is throwing himself into work with his new company, Pure Elite, which runs fitness modelling contests.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But as Janine says: ‘In some ways, a cancer diagnosis would have been easier, as there’d be a clearer outcome one way or the other.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘With chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, we’re in this limbo waiting for something bad to happen but not knowing if it will or not.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>nationalaspergillosis centre.org.uk</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong>Can an elastic band around your head stop you snoring? </strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Can any products stop snoring?

In fact, sleeping on these types of oddly-shaped anti-snoring pillows can cause stiff necks and headaches for some.</span></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>Rhynil Spray for Nose and Mouth</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">£12.99, from healthandcare.co.uk</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">THIS herbal spray contains an extract of the eyebright plant, said to have anti-inflammatory and phlegm-reducing effects (these can obstruct airways and contribute to snoring).

PUTTING IT ON INSIDE OUT</strong><strong></strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It’s pretty difficult to put a condom on inside out.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That’s because one way is much harder to roll out than the other, Dr Turek explained.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And so, a person should – in theory – only be able to put it on one way.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But despite the struggle it may present, many men still end up putting the condom on inside out.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Dr Turek explained: ‘You have to have some kind of mechanical sense, because there’s really only one easy way to roll it out.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you’re using a condom that doesn’t contain spermicide, putting it on inside out isn’t the end of the world.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘It’s a barrier contraceptive so it shouldn’t matter which way it unravels unless there’s spermicide on the inside and not on the outside,’ he said.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But, using an inside out condom with spermicide on the wrong side could decrease the effects of the spermicide – which is supposed to stop sperm from moving.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>2. DOUBLE-BAGGING</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you want to be extra careful, be sure to wear two condoms. At least, that’s how the saying goes.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But in reality, wearing two condoms isn’t as effective as wearing only one.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That’s because two condoms can be a pretty tight fit.</font></p><img id="i-3c5c018e251e56a7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/08/23/2FEDFCC800000578-0-image-a-66_1452294156114.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Putting on a condom inside out is a bad idea - if the condom contains spermicide, which stops sperm from moving. Furthermore, wearing more than one condom at a time can cause a penis to lose sensation - or lead to a rip due to condom-on-condom friction, Dr Turek said" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And if it’s too tight, it can constrict the penis – and you can lose sensation.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘That could lead to delayed ejaculation and getting all sweaty and not ending it,’ Dr Turek said.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Additionally, condom-on-condom friction could lead to a rip in one or both of the condoms – which could allow sperm to escape.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>3. PUTTING IT ON TOO LATE</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Many men wait for foreplay to be done before putting on a condom.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That can be a fine tactic – unless your foreplay involves any penetration.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Any skin-to-skin contact could potentially lead to a STD or pregnancy.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For a man’s pre-ejaculate could actually be loaded with sperm, according to Dr Turek.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And so, waiting ‘too long’ to put a condom on is never a good idea.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘That’s a risky move,’ Dr Turek said.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>4. PUTTING IT ON TOO SOON</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">At the other end of the spectrum, a man shouldn’t attempt to put on a condom when his penis is not yet erect.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Doing so may mean that the condom does not sit properly on the penis.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And, it may even prohibit a man from getting to a place where he could even have sex.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘It may be difficult to get a good erection that does a good job,’ Dr Turek noted.</font></p><img id="i-73afec72551891dd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/08/23/2FEDFC8100000578-0-image-a-67_1452294172454.jpg" height="419" width="634" alt="When it comes to applying a condom, timing is everything, Dr Turek said. Putting it on before a penis is errect can lead to improper applicaiton, while doing it too late could lead to sperm to entering a vagina during foreplay. Leaving it on too long could result in sperm plugging the urethra, which creates sperm-filled pre-ejaculate fluid" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>5. LEAVING IT ON TOO LONG</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">After sex, many partners want to lie in each other’s arms, taking in the moment.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But before the love coma sets in, a man should be sure to take off his condom. Because if he leaves it on too long, he risks having his ejaculate harden.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Dr Turek said: ‘That could be irritating to the skin because it has a lot of anti-inflammatory molecules.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Additionally, the ejaculate could end up plugging the penis’s urethra.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That means leftover sperm could end up staying in place and mixing with pre-ejaculate fluid.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In turn, that could potentially impregnate a woman during foreplay the next time around.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>6. ROLLING A CONDOM OUT BEFOREHAND</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Some men roll a condom out the entire way before putting it on their penis.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That makes the entire process much more difficult, according to Dr Turek.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And, it puts them at risk of breaking the condom.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Instead, men should be sure to put on a condom the way a woman puts on stockings.</font></p><img id="i-f30dcb7f851266ee" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/08/23/2FEDFC6C00000578-0-image-a-68_1452294184184.jpg" height="232" width="634" alt="A condom should be applied the same way a woman puts on stockings - it should be rolled on before being rolled out, rather than laid out completely before it is put on, Dr Turek explained" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘It’s much harder to lay a stocking out than it is to roll it up,’ he said.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Men don’t have a lot of experience with stockings, but they have a lot of experience with socks.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘They try to put it on like socks – and that is harder than putting it on like a stocking.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>7. USING EXPIRED CONDOMS</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You won’t drink expired milk or eat expired cheese. And, you cetainly wouldn’t take expired medicine.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Just as important – a man should also never use an expired condom.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘The effectiveness can’t be guaranteed,’ Dr Turek explains. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If a condom is expired, its rubber or latex can dry out.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That leads to cracks and holes in the condom.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Condoms have a useable lifespan like lots of things,’ Dr Turek said.</font></p><img id="i-2b58e723b5a2647a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/08/23/2FEDFF8000000578-0-image-a-69_1452294196285.jpg" height="480" width="634" alt="Like any product, condoms have a shelf-life, so using an expired condom puts you at risk of pregnancy or STDs, according to Dr Turek. Furthermore, many men 'overestimate' the size of their penis and end up getting condoms that are too big - which opens up 'ports of entry'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>8. GOING FOR THE WRONG SIZE</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Small, medium, large – men seem to have a hard time properly gauging their size.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘Men love to overestimate the size of their penises,’ Dr Turek said.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But if a man is wearing a condom that’s too large, the condom could fall off, roll off or leak from the bottom.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And if a condom is too small, it can be uncomfortable or potentially break.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Dr Turek added: ‘The big damage is getting a condom too big for you that doesn’t stretch appropriately and seal off ports of entry.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>9. REUSING A CONDOM</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Recycling is important for the environment.

You’ve talked to your doctor, cleared your kitchen cupboards of sugary snacks and now you’re ready to embark on the radical eight-week Blood Sugar Diet I’ve been describing in the first three parts of this series.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Yesterday, I outlined menu plans for the second week. Today, you’ll find suggestions to take you through week three. Once you’ve reached week four, the menu plans for weeks five to eight are simply a repetition of weeks one to four.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As I’ve explained previously, this strict, 800-calorie diet can make dramatic differences to blood sugar levels. If you are pre-diabetic (your blood sugar levels are abnormally high, but fall short of the diabetic range), this diet can stop you developing full-blown Type 2 diabetes.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you’re already a Type 2 diabetic, then this diet can reverse the condition, returning your blood sugar levels to normal.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As you will soon discover, the diet isn’t quite as tough as you may fear. Though you will be living on 800 calories a day for the next few weeks, your body should adapt reasonably fast, but what changes should you expect along the way?</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>The first two weeks</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">These are likely to be the toughest, as your body adapts to fewer calories, but you will find that you begin to lose weight, fast. Some of it will be fat, but initially you will also be passing a lot of urine. It is essential that you drink at least two to three litres of calorie-free fluid a day or you are likely to become constipated and suffer headaches.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you are not keen on tap water, try disguising it by adding a squeeze of lemon or lime, or fresh mint and cucumber. I love fizzy water with lots of ice and lemon.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Or drink plenty of fruit tea and the occasional coffee (but with only a splash of milk).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Some people drink just hot water and, oddly enough, there is evidence that heat alone can soothe hunger. Have zero-calorie fizzy drinks if you must, but not fruit juice or commercial smoothies.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>Weeks two to four</strong></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">By week four, your blood sugars should start to stabilise at close to normal levels and your sugar cravings will, hopefully, be much reduced.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You will have lost a lot of weight, with much of it coming off your waist, judging by the results of the research trials that inspired me to devise this diet.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">These were carried out by Roy Taylor, professor of medicine and metabolism at Newcastle University. In one trial, 11 volunteers lost an average of 22 lb by the end of four weeks, most of it fat. They also lost nearly 3 in from their waists.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But a note of caution: when Professor Taylor did a follow-up study with people who were older and had been diabetic for much longer, the results were mixed.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Those who had been diabetic for fewer than four years did really well. But those who had been diabetic for more than eight years and were on lots of medication were less likely to see rapid improvements in their blood sugar levels.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">That said, everyone reported feeling better, sleeping better and being more active. Blood pressure and cholesterol levels also improved across the board.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>After eight weeks</strong></font></p><img id="i-fa8c984788e12f3e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/19/23/305A710E00000578-3407500-image-a-26_1453247956347.jpg" height="498" width="470" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">By the end of the eight weeks, if not before, you will see some big changes in your body shape and biochemistry. You should be sleeping better and feeling a real sense of achievement.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Perhaps you need to buy new trousers. Maybe you stop and look in mirrors to admire the difference.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Pull out those old photos. Take new ones. Post them on Facebook or Twitter. Take time to celebrate what you’ve done with family and friends. Getting this far is a real achievement, but you don’t want to undo all the good work by reverting to your old lifestyle.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Your main preoccupation should now be: ‘How am I going to stay in this shape for the rest of my life?’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">keep your good habits</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As I’m sure you know, many people who diet end up regaining some, if not most, of the weight they have so painfully lost. But this is not inevitable. You should create a lifestyle you can stick to.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">If you try to avoid all your favourite foods and run 20 miles a day, then you’ll fail. Be realistic.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I lost 22 lb three years ago and occasionally I put a couple of pounds back on. But I can rapidly lose them again, and I’m sure the main reason I’ve succeeded in keeping off the weight is because I’ve gone from gorging on sugary carbs to following a Mediterranean-style eating plan. That, and a few other things you might find useful, too:</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ I try to sit at the kitchen table for every meal. If you eat on-the-go or in front of the TV, you will eat badly and beyond the point that you would normally feel full.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ It takes time for food to reach the parts of your small intestine where cells release a hormone, PYY, that tells your brain: ‘I’m full.’ That’s why if you eat slowly, you will eat less.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I regularly put down my knife and fork and try to wait for 30 seconds or so before picking them up again. I also leave food on my plate when I’m no longer hungry. It goes against everything I was taught when growing up.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ I avoid ‘diet’ products as they are usually highly processed and often contain sugar and/or sweeteners (which may not turn off hunger signals).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ I drink soup a lot. It is satiating, cheap and practical. I make large quantities, often out of leftover vegetables, and keep the unused stuff in the freezer.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ If you are drinking wine with your meal, leave the bottle on the other side of the room. Similarly, leave food serving dishes in the kitchen. I find that I am less likely to refill my glass or help myself to seconds if I have to get up from the table.</font></p><img id="i-9ed4de372d20398f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/19/23/305A70F400000578-3407500-image-a-28_1453247969781.jpg" height="405" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-3dea3fec50ab0dfa" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/19/23/305A70D300000578-3407500-image-a-29_1453247980709.jpg" height="606" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-89bf6136065dbd90" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/19/23/305A70C400000578-3407500-image-a-31_1453247985701.jpg" height="536" width="962" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-5772e6abd15732cf" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/20/00/30501E6000000578-3407500-image-a-35_1453248373064.jpg" height="722" width="470" alt="Adapted from The 8-Week Blood Sugar Diet: Lose Weight Fast And Reprogramme Your Body by Michael Mosley (Short Books, £8.99). © Michael Mosley 2016.

My children sometimes sneak in chocolate and biscuits, but know better than to leave them anywhere they can be spotted.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ My weakness is toast. I did suggest to my wife that we throw out the toaster (I would rarely bother to use the grill), but she refused. Instead, I keep unsalted nuts by the toaster, so when I am tempted to snack on toast and marmalade, I eat nuts instead. Mostly.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ I weigh myself several times a week, despite the widely held belief that you should only get on the scales once a week. This is contradicted by a recent trial that followed 40 people on diets. Some weighed themselves daily, others weekly, monthly or hardly at all. The more often people weighed themselves, the more weight they lost.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ When I go out for a meal, I make sure the bread basket is never left on the table or I would just help myself. I stick to one course, with lots of vegetables instead of rice or potatoes. I rarely have a dessert and, when I do, I always share it. Research shows that a small amount of something sticky and tasty is just as satisfying as a large amount.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ I try not to go shopping on an empty stomach and aim to fill half the trolley, at least, with healthy stuff. I used to kid myself that if I bought cake or a packet or biscuits I would only eat a small amount. I know that’s not true. For the same reason, I never buy large bars of chocolate, however much of a bargain they may seem.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ My family got a dog, Tari, and she barks loudly if we don’t take her for a walk at least once a day. This is great exercise for humans, too, but is perhaps not the most practical tip if you live in a city — or prefer cats.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ Keep busy. Take up a new hobby that will keep your body and mind active. I started dancing. It got my heart going and was mentally challenging.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ every day I acknowledge ‘three good things’. This is based on an idea devised by the U.S. psychologist, Professor Martin Seligman. At the end of the day, think of three things that went well and why they did so. It doesn’t have to be much, perhaps someone complimented you or you saw a beautiful sunset. It focuses your attention on the positives and boosts your mood.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ Most weeks I try to fast. For one day I attempt to go at least 12 hours without food. I do this by having breakfast, skipping lunch and eating a light evening meal. There are health benefits from short periods of fasting and it reminds me that I can control hunger and it does not control me.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">■ I think it is sad how many people stand on escalators when they could be burning a few extra calories by walking up them. I normally try to run up them. And that’s just part of the simple fitness regime that has helped to keep me healthy.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I’ll talk more about that in tomorrow’s Mail, introducing you to one of the biggest breakthroughs in sports science in a decade — a cardio programme that takes just a few minutes per week, but can significantly improve your aerobic fitness, boost your mood and make following the Blood Sugar Diet easier.</font></p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"><span class="mol-style-larger"><strong>My GP says I've added TEN YEARS to my life</strong></span></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"><span class="mol-style-italic"><strong>Julian Porter, 53, a photographer, lives with his wife, Sue, who is also a photographer, in Southampton, Hampshire.

Then, back home, I’d unwind with a couple of beers and a bag of crisps. I was always snacking and eating takeaways.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">At 5 ft 8 in, I weighed 18 st 7 lb, giving me a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 39.3, ‘severely obese’. But I didn’t worry about it and just covered up my growing waistline in sharp suits.</font></p><img id="i-33c21957dbe4584d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/19/23/30292FEF00000578-3407500-image-m-9_1453247440519.jpg" height="507" width="470" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-c54f0ba4339b7682" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/19/23/3029315200000578-3407500-image-a-10_1453247450777.jpg" height="507" width="470" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Then, at a routine check-up, I was told I had Type 2. It hit me hard, as the previous week I’d done a photoshoot for the charity Diabetes UK with a man who’d had both legs amputated owing to complications from Type 2. So I was very aware of how dangerous the condition could be.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I was already on statins for high cholesterol and blood pressure pills, and was at high risk of a heart attack, and now I was being put on the diabetes drug metformin. I immediately decided I had to lose weight.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I came across research into the 800-calorie diet and worked out that if I did a lot of exercise, I could increase the calories to 1,000 with the same results. (I also checked with my GP that it was safe for me to follow this diet.)</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Every morning, I got up early and walked for an hour on a treadmill. For breakfast I had porridge and berries, for lunch, crispbread or an open sandwich and in the evenings a good dinner — usually a combination of vegetables, protein and carbohydrates, for instance, salmon and pasta. I never cut out carbs, as I needed them for energy to exercise and I ate nothing after 6pm until the next morning.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Amazingly, I didn’t feel hungry, and in four weeks I lost a stone. I began to exercise more, as I had more energy and wanted to speed up my weight loss — the weight dropped off even quicker, and in five months I lost 7 st. I couldn’t believe how great I felt.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">When I went back to my GP for a blood test, my sugar levels were completely normal. My GP couldn’t believe it and sent the results back to the lab saying they must be wrong.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But when I was retested, the results came back the same. My GP told me he wasn’t sure it was even possible to reverse diabetes, as I had — but it was!</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Now I’ve come off the metformin and even the statins. My high blood pressure is hereditary, so I still need the pills, but it’s a lot more stable now.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I got down to 10 st 7 lb and when I turned up for weddings, people I’d seen the previous year didn’t recognise me.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I’ve since put on a stone, as I was told I looked too gaunt, and I’ve stopped counting calories, as I can now gauge the right amount of food I need. My golden rule is never eat at weddings!</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">My BMI is a healthy 24 and to maintain my weight I have started running outdoors — I’d always been too embarrassed to be seen in running shorts before, but now I look fine. Most days I also cycle about 40 miles.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The best thing about it all is that my GP says I’ve added ten years to my life.</font></p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox health">

If you begin the diet and really don’t feel well on it, or you find 800 calories a day, every day, either too tough or too inconvenient to stick to for the full eight weeks, then I would recommend the 5:2 approach I outline in my bestselling book The Fast Diet.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It is very simple. For five days a week you don’t calorie-count, but follow the low-carb Mediterranean diet I described earlier. Then, for the remaining two days, you cut down your calories to 800 a day using the menus in this series.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You can do this on any two days of the week that suit you, but it is best to be consistent so you get into a pattern.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">You won’t lose weight as fast as you would if you stuck to 800 calories a day, but it can be more effective than conventional dieting. Studies suggest the 5:2 approach is easier to stick to; you lose fat faster and see greater improvements in insulin sensitivity.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In the original version of the Fast Diet, I recommend that men stick to 600 calories and women to 500 twice a week. Going up to 800 is unlikely to make much of a difference, particularly if you go low-carb on the other days.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The 5:2 diet was how I reversed my own diabetes, and since I wrote that book I have received many emails from ‘former diabetics’, including Leo, who had been a Type 2 diabetic for 12 years.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Despite taking medication, Leo’s blood sugar was so bad that in 2012, his doctor said he needed insulin injections. Instead, Leo did my 5:2 diet, lost 44 lb in three months and became drug-free.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Three years later, he has put on a few pounds but his blood sugar remains fine.</font></p></div>

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Have you ever wondered why your genitals are darker than the rest of your body?</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Regardless of race, a person's penis and nipples, areolas and labia are naturally a shade or two deeper in color than their skin.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And the reason? Darkening occurs during puberty, experts told Daily Mail Online.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As sex hormones surge through the body they stimulate the production of melanin - the amino acid responsible for hair and skin color.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The result is for the skin on a man's penis and nipples and a woman's areolas and labia, to darken.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">While the process is a natural one, experts warn, any further darkening in adulthood could be a sign of the chronic illness, diabetes. </font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Dr Lindsey Bordone, a dermatologist at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, told Daily Mail Online: ‘Your skin can darken in certain areas when your sugars are very high – and you’re developing diabetes.’  </font></p><img id="i-b213a2e686234d9e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/08/19/2FED2A8400000578-3390863-image-a-3_1452280405642.jpg" height="417" width="634" alt="It's common for men and women to have genitals and nipples that are darker than the rest of their skin, experts reveal. The change in pigmentation largely occur because sex hormones stimulate production of melanin during puberty" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In childhood a person generally has lighter pigmentation all over – regardless of race.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For instance, some people are born with blonde hair that later turns brown.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Dr Bordone said: ‘When girls are young, their nipples are light. And as they get older, hormones have an effect and the nipples darken.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">‘It’s very similar for boys.’</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But, when puberty kicks in, women experience an increase in estrogen, while men experience an influx of testosterone.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Those hormones regulate melanocytes – which are skin cells that produce melanin, said Dr Cameron Rokhsar, an associate clinical professor of dermatology at Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New York.</font></p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS">

But, darkening can also be a sign of health problems, such as diabetes and obesity " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And so, genital darkening occurs in men who wear tight clothing, shave their genitals or experience an itch or infection that results in  rubbing and scratching.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This darkening can particularly affect athletes, because their genital area undergoes constant friction from running or jumping.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Dr Bordone said: ‘Around the sides of the scrotum or the inner thighs, a lot of times men will have darkening of the skin if they’re active.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But even though darkening is natural, it can also be a symptom of larger health issues.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">When a person gains weight, he or she can experience acanthosis nigricans, which is a skin condition that leads to velvety discolorations in the groin and other areas, according to Dr Rokhsar.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Additionally, certain discolorations are indicative of increased levels of insulin.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Dr Bordone said: ‘If someone notices darkening in some areas they should get checked out – especially if it’s in the neck or armpits, because it can be a sign of diabetes.’</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size: 1.2em"> </font></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Columbia University and Mt.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">At the age of 34, I decided that dental veneers - porcelain shells 'cemented' to the front of your natural teeth to create the illusion of a white, even smile - were the answer to my prayers.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I'd always been unhappy about my teeth. As a child, the front ones stuck out so much I was laughed at in the street, so I had NHS 'train-track' braces at 12.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Once these came off, I was never offered a retainer (to prevent teeth reverting to their old position), and as I hit my 30s, I realised my front teeth were moving forward, creating a gap each side.</font></p><img id="i-ceb845d2005f788f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/28/22/2FA85E7500000578-3376735-image-m-45_1451340285611.jpg" height="707" width="634" alt="Three years ago Leah had her veneers replaced with translucent, flattering ones" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">So, I visited a smart Central London clinic and explained I wanted straight teeth for the rest of my life.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The dentist instantly said I'd need six veneers at a total cost of £4,000 (this was 18 years ago).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He said he would need to 'roughen' my tooth enamel to enable the veneers to stick. I wasn't surprised, therefore, when he numbed my mouth and started polishing away.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">When I looked in the mirror, I saw my previously healthy teeth had been drilled to tiny, mis-shapen stumps.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I felt sick. I'd never been warned about this, and realised the procedure was irreversible. I was then fitted with a strip of plastic known as 'temporaries' - it resembled joke teeth from a Christmas cracker.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">For two weeks I consoled myself that soon I would have my dream smile. Yet, once I got the permanent veneers, I realised they were too short, too square, too thick and several shades darker than my own teeth.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And instead of gaps at the side of my front teeth, there was a gap in the middle. I should have complained, but I just felt ashamed of my poor decision.</font></p><img id="i-bfbaef2c34bf55ef" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/28/22/0BE9D558000005DC-3376735-image-a-42_1451340228289.jpg" height="408" width="306" alt="18 years ago she was seduced by the prospect of a dazzling Hollywood smile" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But the nightmare wasn't only cosmetic. I wasn't warned my new 'lifetime' teeth may last me only until my 40s. Or, as I now know, that having veneers might so damage my remaining 'bits' of teeth that they could die, leaving me needing dentures.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I'm far from the only one to have been seduced by the prospect of a dazzling Hollywood smile.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A Google search reveals hundreds of clinics offering 'one-day smile makeover' veneer treatments and endorsements from celebrities such as Towie stars Lauren Pope and Chloe Sims.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Private cosmetic dentistry is big business: worth £2 billion, which is up from £1.6 billion in 2011, according to market research organisation Mintel.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A quarter of Britons have had some form of cosmetic dentistry, with 18 per cent choosing veneers, a survey by the British Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry found.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But there is growing unease among dentists about the use of veneers, particularly in younger patients, with warnings that having veneers in your 20s or 30s could leave you in agony, thousands of pounds worse off and needing dentures by your 50s.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A 2012 report found that claims against dentists involving porcelain veneers doubled between 2005 and 2010.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">And earlier this year the UK's six leading specialist dental societies published a dramatic joint statement in the British Dental Journal expressing concern at the risks of 'increasingly popular' cosmetic dentistry, describing cases of permanent damage to teeth caused by veneers as a 'worrying and growing problem'.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'The desire for the alleged “perfect smile” needs to be tempered with an awareness of the significant risks,' they wrote.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">They also suggested 'ethical' problems, with some dentists not being honest about the risks - namely that 'aggressive reduction of sound tooth tissue . . . results in structural weakening of teeth'.</font></p><div class="mol-article-quote floatRHS health">
                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox">Instead of gaps at the side of my front teeth, there was a gap in the middle. I should have complained</div>
                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The hard surface of teeth is enamel, up to 2.5 mm deep; underneath is bony dentine, and the core is soft pulp, containing roots, blood vessels and nerves. Before applying veneers, the dentist removes between 0.5 mm to 1 mm of the enamel. The patient will wear temporary acrylic veneers for a week or two while the final veneers are made out of porcelain.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Finally, the teeth are 'etched' using an acid that roughens the surface, opening up tiny 'pores'. Veneers are then attached with a dental cement that bonds into the 'pores' and is hardened with a special light.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'After this, you can never take off your veneers and have your natural teeth,' says Dr Jeremy Hill, from Ware Centre of Dental Excellence in Hertfordshire. 'You're locked into a lifetime of replacement and maintenance.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I was certainly not warned about this, but the fact is the chance of veneers lasting even a decade is remote, says Dr Hill.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'They crack, break or fall off, especially if you grind your teeth. The younger you start, the more likely you are to get into trouble because you'll need to replace them more often.' And every time you replace a veneer, you need to drill deeper, says Dr Christopher Dean, a dentist who works with specialist legal firm, The Dental Law Partnership.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Drilling can trigger inflammation and swelling within the pulp, he says, causing 'excruciating' pain.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'The swelling can eventually strangle the blood vessels supplying the tooth. This causes the nerve to die and so kills the tooth.'</font></p><img id="i-7b02c7d5052b1388" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/28/22/015D166A00000578-3376735-image-m-44_1451340242138.jpg" height="618" width="634" alt="Specialists suggest sometimes veneers are given to people who are unsuitable or dentists aren't skilled" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He says one in ten veneered teeth will need root canal treatment to remove the dead pulp and nerves and clear infection, followed by a crown, which requires more of the natural tooth to be removed.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'If you have 16 or 20 teeth veneered, you will likely need root canal treatment for at least two teeth, which you risk losing entirely.' That's because as many as 10 to 15 per cent of root canals fail, he says.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">This will cause more pain and need another root canal or surgery, plus a new crown. If that fails, the tooth has to be extracted. 'And every time you replace your veneers, you put them at risk again,' says Dr Hill. 'I have seen people in their 50s losing teeth after having veneers in their 20s.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The next step is an expensive implant, a bridge - an artificial tooth with a crown on either side - or dentures.</font></p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health">

Even without problems, veneers cost £350 to £1,000 each, so getting both rows treated can cost £16,000. 'You could easily pay £100,000 for veneers over a lifetime,' says Dr Hill.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">What's more, veneers don't seem to last as long as they once did. Research has found half may need to be replaced and 34 per cent will be fractured after six to ten years (in the Eighties, studies found 15-year survival rates).</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Specialists suggest this is because veneers are increasingly given to people who are unsuitable or because dentists aren't skilled.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'Veneers were invented to cover minor surface imperfections and small gaps,' says Dr Hill.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'They weren't intended to straighten uneven teeth.

'After a year, I got a second opinion from Dr Stuart Jacobs, in Harley Street, who told me the veneers were fitted so badly they needed removing and replacing.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">'I also needed root canal treatment on four teeth, and two had to be replaced with implants.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em"></font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As I listened on the radio to a gloomy report about the incidence of prostate cancer rising in middle-aged men, I rushed to the internet (again) to check the symptoms.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">My worst fears were confirmed. Prostate cancer cells can spread to the bones and cause a dull persistent ache in the lower back. As I'd been nursing a back pain for several weeks, I was convinced that, at the age of 54, I'd become yet another bleak NHS statistic.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">I was unwilling even to entertain the idea that the backache was caused by over-zealous exercise in the gym.</font></p><img id="i-8947113c7ffd5446" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/21/22/2F8E76FC00000578-3369592-image-a-1_1450736901645.jpg" height="774" width="634" alt="Andrew with Midas, a Medical Detection Dog trained to sniff out cancer" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">There was a loud sigh down the telephone when I spoke to my long-suffering GP to demand a prostate cancer test.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Until I was 50, he rarely saw or heard from me. I'd been fit as a fiddle all my life. But then my vision deteriorated so I had both eyes lasered. Then, after becoming breathless walking up and down stairs in 2013, I was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, an irregular, often abnormally fast heartbeat.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">It was fixed after two sessions of electric shock treatment, but it's since become erratic again. I'm now on blood-thinning pills to limit the risk of a stroke from the blood sitting around in my heart and forming a clot.</font></p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">After my call about the back pain, my GP, who now tests me every year for prostate cancer, agreed to my having another Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) blood test. This is used to determine with a biopsy if men need further investigation.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The result came back clear, but I wasn't satisfied. My internet research revealed there is a high 'false positive' rate with the test. Sometimes, three in four men are wrongly diagnosed as having the cancer. Ever the pessimist, I assumed that in my case I had incorrectly been given the all-clear.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A few days later, over dinner at Westminster, where I have spent much of my journalistic career, I sat next to Betsy Duncan Smith, wife of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain.</font></p><img id="i-f73e6fe797098fd3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/21/22/2F8E771000000578-3369592-image-a-9_1450736915815.jpg" height="520" width="634" alt="Dog trainer Chris Jones and Midas, a Hungarian Wirehaired Vizsla breed, testing urine samples" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Several years ago, I interviewed Iain for the Mail and he described the terrible moment in 2009 when Betsy told him she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. 'I was stunned,' he told me.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">He effectively ran his ministerial operation from the family home in Buckinghamshire so he could look after the mother of his four children, whom he married in 1982.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">After two years, which included gruelling bouts of chemotherapy in which she lost all her hair, Betsy was declared cancer-free.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Shortly afterwards, Betsy was persuaded to go to see the work of a new charity called Medical Detection Dogs.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The charity has more than 20 dogs trained to sniff out evidence of breast, prostate and bladder cancer from batches of breath or urine samples. They do a day's work at the centre, then go home to lead a normal life.</font></p><div class="mol-article-quote floatRHS health">
                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox">Our dogs are quicker and cheaper than machines. Dogs are used to detect explosives, so why can't we use them in the NHS?</div>
                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">From never wanting even to think about cancer again, Betsy, daughter of the fifth Lord Cottesloe of Fremantle, became a trustee of the charity. She is now so involved, she fosters one of the sniffer dogs, a cocker spaniel named Jobi.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Over dinner, she told me about what the charity has achieved. A true politician's wife, by the main course she'd persuaded me to see the work for myself.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">After 35 years as a journalist, I was, to say the least, naturally sceptical. But if my PSA result was wrong and I had cancer, as I feared, could a sniffer dog detect it?</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As I arrived at the charity's HQ, - an office which looks like a hut plus a Portakabin in the Buckinghamshire countryside - a black labrador raced across the fields to greet me and repeatedly buried his face in my stomach. I was alarmed: had he caught a whiff of cancer? He was just very friendly, I was told.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The charity is only researching the use of sniffer dogs for cancer at this stage, so my sample couldn't strictly speaking be 'tested'.</font></p><img id="i-df512bd56b25d142" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/21/22/2F8E770000000578-3369592-image-a-10_1450736931550.jpg" height="451" width="634" alt="The dogs do a day's work at the centre, then go home to lead a normal life" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">But it would be one of a number of other 'healthy' samples that would be used in the training of the dogs, along with one sample from a patient known to have prostate cancer. If my PSA result was wrong, and I, too, had cancer, the dog would theoretically spot this as well as the 'genuine' sample.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Midas, aged four, a delightful wire-haired Hungarian Vizsla, was going to check the samples, each contained in a 1ml pot. They were attached to a carousel in the training room (each sample was put on a 'paddle', or flat plate, at the end of one the carousel 'arms'). Midas then sniffed the samples in turn, in two demonstrations before my sample was added to the other seven.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">In barely a second she sat down and was pawing just one sample - the correct one. Midas had given my sample a clean bill of health. Betsy, who was watching, said: 'Our dogs are quicker and cheaper than machines. Dogs are used to detect explosives, so why can't we use them in the NHS?'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">A research programme with 900 prostate cancer patients in Milan, which was reported in the Journal of Urology, revealed a 98 per cent success rate with medical sniffer dogs.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Medical Detection Dogs is now working on a three-year study with Milton Keynes University Hospital after an initial study showed specially trained dogs can detect prostate tumours in urine samples in 93 per cent of cases. The new trial will assess samples from 3,000 patients to check for prostate cancer, as well as kidney and bladder tumours. At the end of the study, the charity hopes to be given permission to take referrals from GPs or private practices. Patients won't be able to self-refer.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The charity is run by Dr Claire Guest, a psychologist and animal behaviourist, whose paper in the British Medical Journal in 2004 was the first to suggest cancer had an odour which could be detected by dogs in samples of urine.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">She set up the Medical Detection Dogs charity in 2008 on a shoestring budget with donations from well-wishers. Then, a year later, Claire was taking her three dogs for their evening walk when her usually placid labrador Daisy refused to leave the back of her car. Instead Daisy repeatedly nuzzled her in the chest. Claire felt the spot and detected a lump. Her doctor referred her to a specialist and tests showed that behind the lump - which itself was a harmless cyst -there was a deep-seated growth, which could have been fatal had it not been detected early. 'I'd never have known it was there,' says Claire.</font></p><img id="i-3565ba0e1a9afc8f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/21/22/2F8E773800000578-3369592-image-a-11_1450736935231.jpg" height="783" width="634" alt="Midas had given Andrew's sample a clean bill of health. The dogs have 'a 98 per cent success rate'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">She underwent a lumpectomy and her lymph nodes were removed; she also had six weeks of radiotherapy.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Six years on, the charity Claire set up is now the world leader in its field. And through her connections Betsy Duncan Smith has brought in, among others, Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, who has been to see the dogs.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">After a private visit in February 2013, the Duchess of Cornwall is now a patron of the charity - Claire has since done a presentation with the dogs at Clarence House.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">Yet despite the support of Charles and Camilla, the charity is desperately short of cash. Even the chair and desk Claire works from are hand-me-downs. 'Britain has one of the worst rates of early cancer detection in Europe,' says Claire, who is convinced the dogs have a significant role to play.</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">As she explains: 'Humans have five million sensory perceptions, dogs have 300 million, which is why they have such an extraordinary sense of smell. They can detect parts per trillion - that's the equivalent of one drop of blood in four Olympic-sized swimming pools.'</font></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><font style="font-size:1.2em">The dogs are already saving the NHS a small fortune in their work with diabetes patients. For as well as training dogs to detect cancer from samples, the charity has trained other dogs to warn their owners of a life-threatening medical alert, such as a drop in blood sugar levels.</font></p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health">
