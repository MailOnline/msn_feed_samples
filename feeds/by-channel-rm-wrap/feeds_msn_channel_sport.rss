However the Romanian clawed her way back into the contest, winning three straight games as both players struggled to hold on to their serves in a monster opening set that swung one way and then the next.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Matt Smith</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T16:17:34.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Simona Halep reaches French Open semi-final after hard-earned victory</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T16:17:34.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>French Open</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-5812475/Garbine-Muguruza-beats-Maria-Sharapova-reach-French-Open-semis.html" title="Garbine Muguruza beats Maria Sharapova in straight sets to reach the French Open semi-finals"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-5808977/Marco-Cecchinato-defeats-Novak-Djokovic-tie-breaker-thriller-Roland-Garros.html" title="Marco Cecchinato books French Open semi-final berth by defeating Novak Djokovic in fourth-set tie-break as Serbian casts doubt over playing at Wimbledon after losing to world No 72"></link></item><item><title>Everton goalkeeper Joel Robles in talks to join Spanish side Getafe</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5812477/Everton-goalkeeper-Joel-Robles-talks-join-Spanish-Getafe.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 15:13:16 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5812477</guid><description><![CDATA[Everton goalkeeper Joel Robles is in talks to join Spanish side Getafe.

</div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Billy Joe Saunders is closing on a London superfight with Gennady Golovkin following the apparent collapse of Triple G's rematch with Canelo Alvarez. Canelo's Golden Boy promoter Oscar De La Hoya has announced the opening of negotiations for Daniel Jacobs to replace Golovkin in Las Vegas on September 15. That clears the way for a world middleweight title unification fight between Golovkin and Saunders, who had withdrawn injured from this month's defence of his WBO belt against Martin Murray. Golovkin, the WBC, WBA, IBF and IBO champion, has long coveted Saunders title, which would complete his set. The Kazakh puncher would have no qualms about returning to London, where he knocked out Kell Brook.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Max Winters</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T15:33:40.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Billy Joe Saunders closes in on London fight with Gennady Golovkin</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T15:33:40.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Gennady Golovkin,Canelo alvarez</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-5806063/Saunders-line-GGG-Canelo-clash-injury.html" title="Injury put paid to Billy Joe Saunders' clash with Martin Murray... but could yet pave the way for megafight with Canelo Alvarez or Gennady Golovkin"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-5800553/Billy-Joe-Saunders-line-Canelo-Gennady-Golovkin-fight-Martin-Murray-withdrawal.html" title="Billy Joe Saunders lined up for huge Canelo Alvarez or Gennady Golovkin fight after Martin Murray withdrawal... and Triple G contest could take place at the London Stadium in September"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-5800277/Billy-Joe-Saunders-withdraws-Martin-Murray-fight-June-23-suffering-injury.html" title="Martin Murray slams Billy Joe Saunders as middleweight champion pulls out of title bout: 'He's just trying to make a big-money fight with Golovkin or Canelo and I'm too risky'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-5784509/Canelo-Alvarez-afford-swerve-duck-Gennady-Golovkin-now.html" title="Canelo Alvarez cannot afford to swerve or duck Gennady Golovkin now...

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Where is Xia and was it his call to suspend Wyness?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Xia has been in China since Villa’s play-off final defeat 10 days ago and he is said to have suspended Wyness after the two had a disagreement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to some, Xia was unhappy with Wyness advising they settle their hefty tax bill owed to HMRC. There is no suggestion that Wyness has been accused of wrongdoing but Xia has now announced he will take over as chief executive until further notice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an alternative version of events it has been claimed Wyness was attempting to bring together a consortium to buy the club without Xia's knowledge, who then found out and acted.</p><img id="i-e2b4e3681233c095" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/11/05292B83000003E8-5811893-image-m-110_1528281204901.jpg" height="512" width="634" alt="Owner Tony Xia suspended Wyness amid talk he was lining up an alternative takeover bid" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Is there a solution?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There could be. What happens next may depend on the valuations of Xia. There is understood to be interest from Peter B Freund, a shareholder in baseball’s New York Yankees, in buying Villa for £75m.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These days, that kind of cash signs you a striker for a top-four Premier League club. Will Xia accept that? The Chinese businessman is believed to have valued Villa at £100m initially.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, given the severity of their financial woes and issues with the HMRC, he could lower it. He may struggle to get a full £100m, given their threat of administration.</p><img id="i-5f738e2e43395db3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/11/4CF7CE1200000578-5811893-Peter_B_Freund_at_Arsenal_the_tycoon_is_reported_to_be_planning_-m-108_1528281136986.jpg" height="495" width="634" alt="Peter B Freund, shareholder in New York Yankees, is understood to be keen on buying Villa" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How does this have an influence on the actual team?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This has led to uncertainty over players’ futures. Terry, their captain of last season, is not set to re-sign when his one-year contract officially expires at the end of this month. West Ham’s Snodgrass is the same.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, we are already deep into the summer window and signings are no doubt down the list of priorities at Villa.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Plus, to find those £40m of savings to adhere to FFP regulations, Jack Grealish could be sold. Villa would want around £30m for him alone, as well as £10m for James Chester.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Villa are set for a reduced final year of parachute payments worth around £16m next season. That does not help you out a lot these days.</p><img id="i-df5a7b97abc8063d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/11/06A0F88A000003E8-5811893-image-a-111_1528281222436.jpg" height="376" width="634" alt="Tom Cairney's winner for Fulham at Wembley could prove extremely expensive for Villa" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>And the manager?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bruce has still not been told by the club that they want him to continue and is said to be considering his future. The now-suspended Wyness was among his allies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also, without investment, it is unlikely Bruce will be able to push for promotion with Villa again next season, particularly as he loses the influence of Terry and potentially Grealish.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He is believed to be open to staying but does Bruce have the backing of the board? No-one knows yet, not even him apparently.</p><img id="i-cb8536f854d55bd0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/11/4C49D4B200000578-5811893-image-a-113_1528281280499.jpg" height="407" width="634" alt="Villa manager Steve Bruce is now in an uncertain position amid behind-the-scenes issues" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>And Xia has stayed silent throughout this?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He is something of a maverick on social media. His last update on Twitter came three days after the defeat by Fulham.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It read: ‘Still hurting. Felt even more when you realise how much all ppl love the club, gaffer, the whole squad, including myself, have given everything but still didn’t achieve our target. Also very difficult to verify ppl showing their real personality and humanity at this tough moment.’</p><img id="i-96e33b5a5df9c222" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/11/4CF14ED700000578-5811893-image-a-112_1528281271464.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Villa released a statement about Wyness, but there is no comment yet about a takeover" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What have the club said amid all this chaos?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Villa released a statement on Tuesday but only addressed the Wyness news, not whether they were looking for a buyer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Aston Villa Football Club can confirm that chief executive, Keith Wyness, has been suspended by the club with immediate effect,’ it said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Owner and chairman, Dr Tony Xia will assume the role until further notice. There will be no further comment from the club at this time.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There will be a lot of work going on behind the scenes. Villa have found themselves pushed into a corner and have to fight hard to get out.</p><div>

He will be their main pundit with the arrangement working out at more than £400,000 per day. The Manchester United manager will be in Moscow for four days at the start of the tournament and will then be on video link on the day of the final.  The deal was announced in March, a day after the Salisbury poisoning, and was criticised by MPs in the wake of the attack. In a statement, Rhondda MP Chris Bryant said: 'To my mind, this is blood money, paid directly from the Russian state coffers.' The channel was also attacked by politicians in France and the United States for pumping out propaganda in support of Russian president Vladimir Putin. There were also calls back in March for its UK broadcasting licence to be withdrawn. Mourinho said at the time: 'I am looking forward to attending the World Cup in Russia and sharing my insights.’</p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">He  said: 'It is very difficult. I don't want to be emotional, but I have to be.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">There will be a number of meetings with players and agents in the coming weeks and a significant number will move on, headed by those who no longer wish to be on Merseyside - Morgan Schneiderlin, who attracted interest from West Ham in January, is one name on that list.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When asked if Everton needed to sell to buy, Brands replied: 'Yes - but it's not only a money thing. Of course money is also important, but it is also for a coach it is not workable to start with 38 players in your squad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'A lot of them are not young players any more. We have to be honest when we take the decision with these players, do they have prospects here at Everton?

In most countries they cannot make the wages they get here in the Premier League.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So a lot of players who don't play (at Everton) cannot play anywhere, as the salaries are not comparable. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'That means even if you have money you have to be careful to spend that money.

'And, of course, they are good players so I hope there will be interest for a few of our players. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There will be meetings with the players and with the agents, yes.

There is no doubt we will probably ask the SANZAAR countries to push their tours on a week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Everybody needs to play a part here. There seems to be a feeling that everyone plays a part in the compromise, but the Premiership are above that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The thing that baffles me is the aggressive stance.

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The important thing then, which everyone from players to coaches has said, is that there has to be appropriate preparation time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Last time guys were arriving in New Zealand three days before the first match. That is where that extra week comes in - we want to spend a week together acclimatising.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Is it too much between all the leagues and SANZAAR themselves to find a week?' Some have suggested that as the home unions of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales run the Lions they could cut the Six Nations down by a week to make up the difference.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The tournament currently is five matches played over seven weeks and Davies is adamant that cannot be shortened.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We have thought of player welfare there having taken advice from players and coaches,' he added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Playing in fewer weeks than that would be challenge the integrity of the competition.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The Six Nations have already made a compromise and think that having two fallow weekends out of seven is right.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Everyone else seems to have to make moves apart from the Premiership. That's the way it comes over.' The other criticism from McCafferty was that the Lions had not contacted him about the schedule.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Davies said they are negotiating with SANZAAR (the southern hemisphere governing body) and the home unions and told the Premiership to wait their turn.</p><img id="i-540633b122a90611" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/00/050B55EC000003E8-5810311-image-a-10_1528242095452.jpg" height="386" width="634" alt="Lions and New Zealand players join together after the epic drawn series in 2017" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'No one can knock Mark for saying the Lions should be talking to them - that will come,' said Davies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But to just point the finger and say "they're not doing this..." He can pick up the phone can't he?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Just because we have not talked to the Premiership - are they more special than anybody else? I'm surprised at the outburst.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We all want to talk and make sure there is an accommodation that hurts everyone the least.' There were suggestions that the Lions were under-represented and unable to voice their views at a summit in San Francisco tasked with sorting out the global calendar from 2020-32 last year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Davies was happy with those who went and batted for the Lions - he confirmed Lions board members Philip Browne (IRFU CEO) and Ian Ritchie (former RFU CEO) attended.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The Lions board were happy that they were more than capable of representing us,' Davies said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I know people have said there wasn't a specific representative but there was nobody from Wales there, and we were happy with it.' And with worries that the Lions will become an endangered species Davies called upon the key stakeholders in the game to save rugby's biggest beast.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'From my perspective it would be foolhardy to mess any further with the Lions,' he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There has to be an acceptance that the "good old days" of 20-match tours can't happen. It has come down, it was 10 on the last tour and there is talk of eight on the next tour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'From my point of view it certainly can't go any lower than that. However, in Australia you might struggle to get eight games.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'While I get the romantic side of the Lions we have to accept it is a professional game and there are other entities. Hence the conversation with the various leagues. Eight is likely to be the compromise.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It won't go below eight - there is no way. It would not make it a tour for the Lions or for the host country either.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'As long as it is maintained at eight matches I don't think it becomes a sacrificial lamb.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'To be fair to Mark, he is right, the solution will come from talking - and that is what the Lions are going to do. That is going to happen.'</p><div>

Karius first threw the ball directly into Karim Benzema's path to score the opener before parrying Gareth Bale's shot into his own net for Madrid's third. Two minutes before the first error, Karius was caught by an elbow from Madrid captain Sergio Ramos and the German later underwent scans at Massachusetts General Hospital. </dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Robert Cottingham</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T00:41:31.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Thibaut Courtois doubts concussion played role in Loris Karius errors</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T00:41:31.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Chelsea,Belgium Football,Liverpool</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5809089/Belgium-complete-preparations-World-Cup-warm-friendly-against-Egypt-without-Vincent-Kompany.html" title="Belgium complete preparations for their penultimate World Cup warm-up friendly against Egypt without the injured Vincent Kompany in Tubize"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5810093/Kevin-Trapp-Loris-Karius-come-Champions-League-gaffes.html" title="'I know he will come back from that': Loris Karius backed to get over Champions League final blunders as Kevin Trapp gives 'props' to Liverpool goalkeeper for playing on concussed"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5808131/Sergio-Ramos-hits-against-claims-injured-Liverpool-duo.html" title="'All that's missing is that they say Firmino caught a cold from one of my drops of sweat': Sergio Ramos hits back at claims he deliberately injured Liverpool duo Mo Salah and Loris Karius in the Champions League final"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5807503/Sergio-Ramos-Real-Madrid-team-mates-meet-Spain-time.html" title="Sergio Ramos struts back into Spain squad with his Real Madrid Champions League winners...and lets Diego Costa know who's in charge at World Cup training camp"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5804423/Liverpool-goalkeeper-Loris-Karius-underwent-head-scan-Champions-League-final.html" title="Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius DID sustain a concussion in Champions League final | Daily Mail Online"></link></item><item><title>'Arsenal and Liverpool aren't bad clubs but...': Jasper Cillessen aware of interest from Premier League duo but will only move if Barcelona want him to</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5810295/Jasper-Cillessen-Arsenal-Liverpool-arent-bad-clubs-but.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jun 2018 23:31:16 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5810295</guid><description><![CDATA[The 29-year-old goalkeeper admits he is aware of interest from Premier League clubs with Liverpool and Arsenal both believed to be keeping an eye of his situation at the La Liga Champions.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

So it came as no surprise when the 21-year-old German, in the last eight of a Grand Slam for the first time, began to cramp up badly.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>George Flood</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-05T23:12:47.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Zverev laments injury issues after French Open quarter-final loss</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-05T23:12:47.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>French Open</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-5808977/Marco-Cecchinato-defeats-Novak-Djokovic-tie-breaker-thriller-Roland-Garros.html" title="Marco Cecchinato books French Open semi-final berth by defeating Novak Djokovic in fourth-set tie-break as Serbian casts doubt over playing at Wimbledon after losing to world No 72"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-5805925/Muguruza-books-French-Open-quarter-final-tie-Sharapova-opponent-Tsurenko-retires.html" title="Garbine Muguruza books French Open quarter-final tie with Maria Sharapova after opponent Lesia Tsurenko retires hurt after just two games"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-5805899/Juan-Martin-Del-Potro-beats-John-Isner-set-quarter-final-showdown-against-Marin-Cilic.html" title="Juan Martin Del Potro beats John Isner to set up quarter-final showdown against Marin Cilic at French Open "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-5803647/Serena-Williams-PULLS-French-Open-showdown-Russian-rival-Maria-Sharapova.html" title="'Right now I cannot physically serve...

The Selecao breezed to the final while their opponents struggled. Midfielder Zizinho even admitted that he was signing autographs as 'Brazil, champions of the world' the day before the game. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brazil even took the lead but that seemed to only add to their complacency as a rugged Uruguay side clawed their way back into the game through Juan  Schiaffino just after the hour mark before winger Alcides Ghiggia silenced the crowd for the first time that afternoon. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By the time English referee George Reader blew the full-time whistle, all joy from the home side had gone.

Heading into the quarter-finals in Mexico City, the sense of anticipation was palpable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were political undertones with the Falklands War still fresh in the memory, but the match was billed as two of the best forwards in world football coming face-to-face… it was Diego Maradona vs Gary Lineker, and both of them got on the scoresheet in a match that would go down in history.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The opening goal provided one of the most famous moments the game has ever seen, as Maradona produced his 'Hand of God' shocker to score past a helpless Peter Shilton in the England goal. Furious Three Lions protests were waved away by the referee in the blistering Mexico heat, and Argentina's path to the semis had been paved.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There was nothing England could do about the second goal either, as Maradona weaved his way through to score what has been labelled one of the greatest  goals of all-time. Picking up the ball inside his own half, the legendary Argentinian weaved his way through the entire England team before prodding past Shilton to complete the victory.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lineker pulled one back for England with nine minutes left, but there was just one name on the lips of football fans in the aftermath… Diego Armando Maradona.</p><img id="i-41e76d1bec003c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/11/356F621400000578-5798767-image-a-3_1528020732572.jpg" height="417" width="634" alt="Diego Maradona's 'Hand of God' goal against England in 1986 has gone down in infamy" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><strong>7) Sweden 2-5 Brazil, 1958</strong></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The final of the 1958 World Cup saw Sweden come agonisingly close to winning the tournament on home turf in Solna. Nils Leidholm opened the scoring early on to give the hosts hope, but the match will forever be remembered as the day a 17-year-old Pele announced himself to the world.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Such was his talent unknown at that point, Pele didn't even feature in Brazil's opening two games at the tournament, before being unleashed in the latter stages. He scored the winner against Wales and a hat-trick against France, and was named in the starting line-up for the final, with all eyes firmly upon him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not one to back down, Pele produced one of the most incredible solo performances, scoring twice – including one of the best goals ever seen at a World Cup – and he was still just a child.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Brazil's third goal was when it all changed for Pele. He controlled the ball on his chest, lifted it over a defender's head, and fired home on the volley to put his side 3-1 up on the way to a 5-2 victory. There were tears from the great man at the final whistle… and 29 June 1958 was the day that kickstarted the greatest career of all time.</p><img id="i-938c936f995a9935" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/11/00C419B900000190-5798767-image-a-8_1528020732675.jpg" height="473" width="634" alt="A 17-year-old Pele is left in tears after his two goals helped Brazil win the World Cup in 1958" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>6) Brazil 1-0 England, 1970</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="class">It was, according to those who played in the game, the 'real final'. Sadly, fate conspired to make it a group game. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="class">The fact that Brazil would go on to stroll past the Italians in that final is a testament to both the quality the Three Lions possessed, however they came up just short in this gruelling encounter. </span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="class">Reigning champions England were perhaps even better than the team that emerged victorious in 1966; they were taking on the great Brazil and Pele, the winners in 1958 and 1962.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="class">Played in the searing heat at the Estadio Jalisco in Guadalajara, the first half saw Gordon Banks pull off perhaps the greatest save of all time from Pele's low header.</span></p><div class="mol-embed"><div><div style="left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 74.9457%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HNLam4RAbg8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" style="top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"></iframe></div></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="class">The action continued with chances for both sides. Bobby Moore, then at his absolute peak, produced his iconic tackle to stop a charging Jairiznho. Calmly ushering the great man to the edge of the area, the West Ham man expertly poached the ball before danger could develop. His casual stroll up the pitch and simple pass afterwards were a testament to his easy genius.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="class">It was Jairzinho who broke the deadlock and fired home the winner in the 59th minute after a flowing Brazil move.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="class">Ultimately the Selecao had won, but one image summed up the respect they held for their opponents. At full-time, the great Pele sought out his adversary Moore and the pair shared a moment of mutual admiration, displaying their respect for one another both on and off the pitch. </span></p><img id="i-284fa982b7269498" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/10/0032FDCA00000190-5798767-image-m-7_1528190554797.jpg" height="824" width="634" alt="Bobby Moore and Pele share an exchange and swap shirts after the full-time whistle in 1970" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"><strong>5) West Germany 3-3 France, 1982</strong></h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were goals aplenty at Espana 1982, and the semi-final clash between West Germany and France was no different… although most of them came very late on. The Germans went into the tie without their star man Karl-Heinze Rummenigge, on the bench nursing a hamstring injury, but they still managed to take an early lead through Pierre Littbarksi, before Michel Platini levelled things up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As the game entered its final stages, there was nothing to suggest it would live long in the memory, but then everything changed and it turned seriously sour with half an hour to play. Patrick Battison was through on goal, with a real chance of delivering the World Cup to France, when he was clattered by Germany's goalkeeper Harald Schumacher. The ball was nowhere near the player, and to many it looked like a deliberate, and brutal, attack.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Incredibly, despite two lost teeth, three cracked ribs, a damaged vertebrae and half an hour unconscious, Battison was deemed not to have been fouled  and Schumacher remained on the field of play until the end of the match.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In extra time, a furious France had their backs up and raced into a 3-1 lead before West Germany came back to level at 3-3 with goals in the 102nd and 108th minute. Incredibly, villain of the piece Schumacher then saved two penalties in the shootout to help his side through to the final.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In France after the tournament, a national newspaper ran a poll to decide Germany's least popular person… Schumacher edged out one Adolf Hitler to claim the prize.

When the two sides walked out for their semi-final match at Belo Horizonte, Brazil's home advantage made them the favourites to not only beat Germany, but to win the entire tournament.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What happened instead was truly remarkable, and we are unlikely to see another game like this for a long, long time. Germany produced an incredible display and stunned the world with five first-half goals, including four in just six minutes midway through the opening period.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Miroslav Klose scored to become the World Cup's all-time leading goalscorer, Toni Kroos and Andre Schurrle netted twice each, Thomas Muller and Sami Khedira got in on the act… it was a truly humiliating defeat for Brazil which left the entire country distraught and the entire world in a state of shock.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The enduring memories of the match are with David Luiz, being walked off the field in tears at full-time, shots of the crowd covering their faces with their scarves in embarrassment at the result.

Hurst, Peters, Hurst, Hurst — a 4-2 victory over West Germany on the most famous of all afternoons at Wembley Stadium.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, it didn't come without controversy, as Geoff Hurst's second goal provided years and years of questions about whether the ball really did cross the line. First, though - back to the start.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">England went 1-0 down early on as Helmut Haller scored for the Germans, but Hurst quickly grabbed his first of the afternoon before setting up Peters to put the home side in front. With just seconds remaining of the match, Wolfgang Weber provided the first moment of real drama as he equalised for West Germany and took the tie to extra time. There were questions over a potential handball in the build-up that England goalkeeper Gordon Banks never let lie.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was in extra time that it really got going though, as Hurst crashed a shot off the crossbar, watching it bounce down and then out of the goal. The Soviet linesman Tofiq Bahramov gave the goal, but the Germans were - and still are - furious and claim that the ball didn't cross the line.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the last minute of the game, with Germany pressing for another late equaliser, Hurst raced through and was one-on-one with the goalkeeper with the chance to put the game to bed. Some fans ran onto the pitch as he sprinted through, and the moment was best described by commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme. I'll leave it to him to take you home...</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And here comes Hurst! He's got... Some people are on the pitch!

With hindsight, these two sides could be regarded as two of the best in their country's history.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All eyes were on Paolo Rossi heading into the game, Italy's star striker having endured a difficult tournament up to that point. No goals, three poor performances, and he needed to turn up... but turn up he did.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rossi opened the scoring inside five minutes, before Socrates levelled things up for Brazil just a few minutes later with the goal of the game. Rossi was back at it inside 25 minutes, but still Brazil fought back in an incredible match in Barcelona. Falcao made it 2-2 with 22 minutes left to play, but it was all set up for Rossi to save his side once again. A hat-trick on the biggest stage to really kick-start his country's tournament.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rossi went on to score the most goals in the tournament and was voted best player, while Italy lifted their third World Cup title in the final against West Germany.

Football doesn't get any better than this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Italians went ahead through Roberto Boninsegna and looked destined to reach the final until the 90th minute when Karl-Heinz Schnellinger equalised for West Germany. Until this point, the game was good - but nothing overly special and certainly not destined to become the greatest match in World Cup history. But bear with me...</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Franz Beckenbauer dislocated his shoulder late on in normal time, but Germany manager Helmut Schon had already used up his substitutes, meaning the country's star man had to stay on the pitch for the entirety, battling through severe pain with his country's hopes resting heavily upon him.</p><div class="mol-embed"><div><div style="left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6SMCl43Qa2o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" style="top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"></iframe></div></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite them essentially being a man down, Gerd Muller put West Germany 2-1 up in the opening minutes of extra time, but it lasted just four minutes before Italy levelled things up. Not willing to go behind again, Gigi Riva then gave Italy the lead for the second time in the match, completing their comeback to make it 3-2.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Germany still weren't done though, and in the 110th minute Muller again got on the scoresheet to level things up for his side. 10 minutes to play at the Estadio Azteca... but this is where Germany's luck ran out. Just seconds after the restart, with TV cameras still showing Muller's equaliser, Gianni Rivera went up the other end and made it 4-3 to Italy, firing them into the World Cup final.</p><div>

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mum Christine remembers it well: 'That was the game where all the old guys were saying, "Heywood must be struggling, they've got a girl playing". Kate got four wickets and they were like "oh".'  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there was the time Kate made her mark in the Heywood first team alongside brother Bobby.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Bobby fielded at mid-off so he could talk to me and make sure I wasn't nervous. This guy chipped the ball up, the easiest catch, but Bobby spilled it. There's a picture of him with his head in his hands on the deck.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Big brother winces. 'She was the first girl to play in the league in 123 years and it would have been her first wicket,' Bobby says. 'A week after we went to a West Ham reunion for the 1980 FA Cup.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">David interjects: 'Not for the four goals I scored in one game against Spurs,' says the ex-Hammer, knowing the footballing loyalties of this writer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Ben Shepherd, a big West Ham fan, was hosting and when I was introduced, he asked if I played the game,' says Bobby, a good enough batsman to spend two years on the Lancashire staff.</p><img id="i-66bcc3061269b912" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/20/4CEFA79200000578-5809373-image-a-73_1528226570072.jpg" height="433" width="634" alt="Lancashire right-arm bowler Kate was one of England's first professional female cricketers" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-268fa62640bada96" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/20/4CEFA18200000578-5809373-image-a-74_1528226853351.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="1980 FA Cup winner David, right, in action for West Ham against Swansea in 1979" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When I mentioned Kate he said, "you're not the guy who dropped a catch off his sister are you?" We'd travelled to London and I heard that!' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is a typical exchange in a morning with an extraordinary family. David, so fearsome during his career that West Ham fans dubbed him 'Psycho', actually prefers cricket and his family are steeped in it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Completing the set as all five members of the family joined <span class="mol-style-italic">Sportsmail</span> was middle child Jenny, who was forced to keep wicket in the garden while her brother batted and her sister bowled.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She is now physio at women's Super League club Lancashire Thunder. Bobby is the club's manager. 'And dad is the bus driver,' said Kate, the youngest of the three Cross children at 26.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Crosses take time out to ponder a lifetime's involvement in cricket. 'I played here as a kid and made the first team by 15,' said David, trim and fit at 67. 'It was suggested it might be cricket for me but I wasn't good enough. There was no money in cricket then either and I got a chance to sign for Rochdale and took it. I didn't play cricket again for 20 years.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By that time his son was making a name for himself. 'Bobby and I between us have scored 17,743 runs for the first team. I've got 400 of them!' smiled David.</p><img id="i-4e9c48fef3860cdd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/19/4CF1AEF800000578-5809373-image-a-63_1528223715657.jpg" height="453" width="634" alt="Kate and David with the rest of the family, Bobby (top, left) Jenny (top, right) and Christine" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-63a6d8379fe311be" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/20/4CF1B0DD00000578-5809373-image-a-75_1528227141542.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Middle child Jenny is now the physio at women's Super League club Lancashire Thunder" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I finished cricket when I was 18 and started playing again when I was 39 and in those 20 years I hadn't moved on with the game. I was playing like you did in the 1960s. I was stuck in a time-warp. I was a dull batsman, I'd describe myself as a pinch-blocker!'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kate is happy to poke fun at her Dad again. 'It was more your kit they were laughing at,' she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mum Christine had little option but to get involved. 'I always thought cricket was really boring, but then I started to go out with David and when Bobby started playing I really started getting involved - scoring, making teas. I even played a game last year - in the Prosecco League.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kate adds: 'I asked her how she got on and she said it was good but she wasn't sure about this over-arm bowling!'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is Kate who made the biggest impression, becoming one of the first English professional women's cricketers. 'Cricket was all I ever knew,' she said. 'My mates were lads and it was natural for me to play with them. It was never an issue to have a girl and they are still some of my best friends.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But there have been downs as well as ups. Kate has not played for England for two years even though she was in the squad that toured India last winter. Now, for the first time, one of the biggest reasons for that becomes clear. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Kate's had anxiety and stress issues over the last two years and that cost her a place in the team,' said her Dad. 'Mental health is massive now in sport and Kate and Sarah Taylor are close and both suffered from the same thing but never talked to one another about it. Sarah's has been made public but Kate's issues have gone under the radar.'</p><img id="i-e055805e9162f802" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/20/4CF1AEE900000578-5809373-image-a-76_1528227219938.jpg" height="923" width="634" alt="Kate has not played for England in two years after suffering from anxiety and stress issues" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-5a2de1817941728c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/20/4CF1B0A800000578-5809373-image-a-77_1528227308306.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="She is hopeful of making a return to international cricket despite missing out on latest squad" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kate continues: 'I'm comfortable talking about it now and, like Sarah, if that helps someone, I'm happy to do it. I had no idea Sarah was going through it and she had no idea I was, yet we were best friends. How we managed to do that I don't know. I get a lot of messages on social media from people going through similar issues and that can be inspiring. There is light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The era Dad was playing in, if ever anyone had an injury it was "get ice on it". That's the kind of mentality we all had growing up. So I found it difficult initially to talk to Mum and Dad. But one of the positives that has come from it is that as a family we're all a lot closer because I've had to talk to them about what I was going through and Dad went through similar things as a footballer but they didn't talk about it then.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is the cue to talk about David's goalscoring in the 1970s and 80s. 'The biggest thing that got me through a 20-year career was always thinking I might not be good enough,' admitted David.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I had a lot of self-doubt and that drove me on. I always thought I'd get let go. But I was always able to score goals.' He was good enough to score 223 in 599 appearances for a variety of clubs but it is at West Ham where he is remembered most fondly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the man sitting before me does not look that scary. Why Psycho? 'It was a nickname with the West Ham fans,' said David. 'The players knew that wasn't me. I just became that person on the field, that headcase. We played Cardiff one day and I was in the mix just before half-time, in a scuffle which you could get away with those days, and I got booked. One of the West Ham fans right next to me said "you're a psycho, aren't you?" I laughed and it stuck.</p><img id="i-d5d933eca922a232" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/21/4CF1B0BD00000578-5809373-image-a-78_1528229209356.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="David scored 223 goals in 599 games during his career and was nicknamed 'Psycho'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If one of our lads got kicked I was always first in to try to sort out the opposition player. It was ridiculous really because if anyone wanted a fight with me now I'd be up the road faster than anyone could move!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It went back to the Rochdale coach telling me I had to be a nasty piece of work when I was a kid and I felt I could get away with a certain amount. Centre-halves were never going to hurt me and I didn't mind getting hurt to score a goal.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The superstitious David held a small metal pig for luck throughout West Ham's FA Cup final win over Arsenal in 1980 and passed it on to his children. Kate carries the latest model wherever she goes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kate's sense of fun has been good for the women's game. She attracted more than 51,000 views on YouTube of her car-pool karaoke with England team-mate Alex Hartley, while inadvertently raising a smile by singing while a guest on a BBC news programme when she didn't realise her microphone was still on. 'They were having a debate about Brexit but all they could hear was Kate singing Adele,' said her Dad.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last word to Kate, who this week missed out on selection for England's squad to face South Africa. 'I do like to have fun but I know you need to be remembered for your cricket. Mentally I feel really good and I feel as though I'm bowling the best in a while so I'm hopeful of getting back in there. And my family are always supporting me.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are an extraordinary cricketing family.</p><div>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">We haven’t seen much of Mark Clattenburg recently, but we will be over the coming weeks. For a start, he is joining the ITV panel for a World Cup that will use VAR for the first time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The man who left the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/premierleague/index.html" id="mol-b4602ed0-6907-11e8-aa53-ffdc1dcfc5e5">Premier League</a> to take up a position as <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/saudi_arabia/index.html" id="mol-b45dbdd0-6907-11e8-aa53-ffdc1dcfc5e5">Saudi Arabia</a>’s head of refereeing has plenty to say and should make for entertaining viewing. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tanned, toned and fresh from taking charge of the Crown Prince Cup final in Saudi, Clattenburg will look the part in <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/russia/index.html" id="mol-b45d96c0-6907-11e8-aa53-ffdc1dcfc5e5">Russia</a>. And he feels that referees should have more opportunities to speak their mind.</p><img id="i-db5b89607457a646" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/20/4CF1BB8500000578-0-image-a-29_1528227978252.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Mark Clattenburg is set to return to TV screens as part of a panel during the Russia World Cup" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘That is one thing I would change,’ he begins, ‘I would let referees have a voice. It was hard, especially when you are perceived in a certain way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘People call me arrogant, but my friends and family know that’s not true. I’m shy, if anything. You have to carry yourself in a certain way around these top players, but do you think I walked around like that at home? It wouldn’t be allowed!</p><div>

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There were so many situations I couldn’t speak about and that was frustrating, it leads to speculation you can’t control.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">OK then, let’s set the record straight. We start with John Mikel Obi, the Chelsea player he was accused of racially abusing during Manchester United’s 3-2 win at Stamford Bridge in 2012.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I had sent off two Chelsea players and there was an offside goal late on as well, so it was pretty heated coming off,’ explains Clattenburg.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Mikel came into my dressing room and certain things happened which I’ll leave in there. But then Ramires made the allegation that I’d called Mikel a monkey on the pitch.</p><img id="i-7d560a7af2f1c343" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/21/4CEF99B100000578-0-image-m-31_1528229081710.jpg" height="456" width="634" alt="Clattenburg rose through the officiating ranks to become the country's top referee" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The first few days I was soul-searching — you know you’re innocent yet you’re made to feel otherwise. It took four weeks for Chelsea to reveal the moment it had allegedly happened, and after that it was very quickly dismissed. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But Bruce Buck (the Chelsea chairman) didn’t understand that referees are normal people living in a normal house. He thought we lived in a gated community with security and wandered into work every day carrying a washbag.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The media were camped outside my house for days on end. It made world news. That is hard to deal with, I tell you. I knew it wasn’t true, but I could not speak. Me and my family went through hell — I even thought about quitting.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even now, a sour taste lingers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘If Mikel had come out and apologised, OK, be a man about it,’ he says. ‘But I haven’t got respect for someone who makes a mistake on someone else’s allegation and can’t then say sorry.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was in 2014 that Clattenburg was dropped from a round of top-flight fixtures after driving alone to an Ed Sheeran concert following a game rather than travelling with his officials. ‘That’s one way to get the weekend off,’ he laughs. ‘That was blown out of all proportion, like most things involving me.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Such as in 2013 when Southampton made an official complaint after Clattenburg told Adam Lallana: ‘You’re different since you’ve played for England. You never used to be like this.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clattenburg reflects: ‘Well, he had changed! He was a nice guy, I got on with him. After England, he was completely different, that’s my opinion.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘And I chose to have that dialogue with players, it’s part of managing the game.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finally, Craig Bellamy, of whom he once asked the Manchester City bench: ‘How do you work with him all week?’.</p><img id="i-4306b4306ecf03c2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/21/4CEF999900000578-0-image-a-32_1528229118349.jpg" height="502" width="634" alt="Challenges mounted and allegations of racism left Clattenburg and family going through 'hell'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-ff50f76d816b2df" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/23/4CF1B5CA00000578-5809713-image-a-50_1528236729355.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Clattenburg was in conversation with Sportsmail reporter Craig Hope" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I was just being honest!’ says Clattenburg. ‘He was the hardest player I ever had to referee — he always had a bloody answer.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Attention turns to his role as the first referee to join a World Cup TV panel, lining up with regulars including Roy Keane, Martin O’Neill and Slaven Bilic. ‘I’m not there just to hang people out to dry when they make mistakes or go, “Yeah, he was great”,’ he says. ‘I want to explain how they made their decisions, right and wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There is a thought process we go through and I want to take the viewers inside the referee’s mind. It’s about insight, not just saying that should have been a red card or a penalty.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just days before he left for Saudi Arabia last year, Clattenburg, now 43, honoured a fundraising commitment at a social club on the seafront in Seaham, County Durham.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He could have made his excuses — his name was on the back pages with the news that the nation’s No 1 referee was leaving the country — but he kept his promise to a North East boys’ club.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clattenburg told one story that night which he repeated to <span class="mol-style-italic">Sportsmail</span>. It hints at one of the reasons why this country’s top official was ready to walk away: his personality clash with referees’ chief Mike Riley and his governing body, the PGMOL.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We were away in a hotel and I was Mike’s fourth official,’ says Clattenburg. ‘We came back after lunch and his speakers were missing from his bag. He came banging on my door: “Where’s my speakers?”. I told him: “I haven’t got them.”</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We went to the game and I was off checking the team colours. When I came back my bag was all over the place in the dressing room, and he’d thrown everything out looking for those bloody speakers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I wasn’t happy. I said: “If you don’t put my clothes back in my bag I’ll f****** clip you”. That’s perhaps why he doesn’t like me!’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Tantrums aside, there is a wider frustration with those at the helm of his profession.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I have a lot of respect for Mike because he has built a big organisation and given them more business sense,’ he adds. ‘I just feel they get things wrong — they don’t retain their best guys. Graham Poll, Howard Webb, me, they’ve lost all that experience. Other countries are employing our top referees to educate their own. How can that be?’</p><img id="i-d221db0d9e98df13" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/21/4CF1BB8D00000578-0-image-m-35_1528229169913.jpg" height="443" width="634" alt="Clattenburg famously clashed with Adam Lallana and said playing for England changed him" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-1d1d2915edf617ba" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/21/4CF1BB7D00000578-0-image-a-34_1528229166341.jpg" height="449" width="634" alt="Of all players he has worked alongside Clattenburg puts Craig Bellamy down as the toughest" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clattenburg had just refereed the biggest and best game of his life when he returned to the changing room at the San Siro. It was the Champions League final of 2016, won by Real Madrid following a penalty shootout with Atletico Madrid. The officials had been flawless.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I turned on my phone and all that came up were loads of pictures of me doing something daft with my tongue,’ he says of the viral clip which was tagged ‘Clattenburg’s Lizard Tongue’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I didn’t even know I’d done it. I think my mouth must have been completely dry. I’d just had the game of my career and all I’m watching is this Lizard Tongue! I couldn’t do it again if I tried.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clattenburg, who had already presided over that year’s FA Cup final, went on to referee the final of Euro 2016 in which Portugal defeated France, a match awarded to him by UEFA chief and former World Cup final referee Pierluigi Collina.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During conversation he will often mention the Italian unprompted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘He was a different class,’ says Clattenburg. ‘He studied tactics, he knew before the player committed the offence what they were going to do. That’s the difference between someone like him and Mike Riley, who didn’t have that skillset. Not many do.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But when Collina’s number came up on your phone, I’ll admit, you feared a telling-off. I remember after a Malmo versus Atletico Madrid game, he told me it was unacceptable I’d worn the same colours as one of the teams. He was right, it was amateurish. I thought my career was over.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But the next week he gave me a big appointment and I felt a million dollars. I thought, “I’d die for you”. I went up another level. He turned me into a world-class referee.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With that elevation came the three prestigious finals in just two months. He does not reject the notion, however, that motivation then became an issue.</p><img id="i-3e5b39dbc8cb8ced" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/21/4CF29CB800000578-0-image-a-37_1528229389422.jpg" height="443" width="634" alt="Clattenburg's relationship with referee's chief Mike Riley was always a strained one" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Definitely,’ says Clattenburg. ‘I’d put so much into that year — commitment, fitness. It just exploded, getting all of the finals in one go. The only thing left after that was getting to a World Cup, and that’s my only regret.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But sometimes job offers don’t come along, especially in refereeing. That’s why you see refs in the Premier League in their 50s. You’re stuck, there’s no get-out. I was given a chance and, financially, I could look after my family.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Once I’d had a conversation with my wife, it all added up. And at least I can watch Newcastle with a little bit of enjoyment instead of watching the referee!’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clattenburg was born in Consett, County Durham, and was refereeing in the Northern League at 19, by which time he was also working as an electrical engineer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I used to go to Newcastle reserves games as a kid with one man and his dog and I’d watch the referees,’ he says.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-834c07a0-68fe-11e8-aa53-ffdc1dcfc5e5">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox">I’m just a working-class guy who was lucky enough to do something I loved. The tattoos... I was proud, it was everything I’d worked for, I should be able to enjoy that</div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I started so young and became the youngest Football League referee in history at 24. That’s been beaten by another Geordie now, Michael Oliver, and quite rightly. But I’ll say to Michael, “Be careful, you can achieve everything too quickly”.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was the award of the FA Cup final — an honour allowed only once — which accelerated his decision to leave. But it is that match, a 2-1 win for Manchester United over Crystal Palace, which he also wishes he could re-referee more than any other.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It just didn’t work out in the crucial moments,’ he says. ‘I wasn’t happy with myself.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘And that stays with you for days, you’re miserable at home. But it was Palace as well, and their fans had a thing about me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I had 13 games with them in the Premier League and they never got a win. I remember they played Aston Villa when they were rock bottom. I thought: “Great, this could be the end of it.” Then Wayne Hennessey threw one in and Villa won 1-0! I thought: “This run is just jinxed.” ’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The abuse Clattenburg has received is not confined to the terraces. He was at the races one day when a sausage roll was thrown towards his head by a Chelsea fan.</p><img id="i-3952aa417590d7bd" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/21/4CF1B5DD00000578-0-image-a-38_1528229983303.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Moving to Saudi Arabia gave Clattenburg the chance to financially secure his family's future" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then there are the online insults, which grew especially fierce after he revealed the tattoos celebrating his achievements of 2016.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘They want you to be a perfect role model as a referee,’ he says. ‘But life doesn’t work like that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘I’m just a working-class guy who was lucky enough to do something I loved. The tattoos... I was proud, it was everything I’d worked for, I should be able to enjoy that.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Spend time with Clattenburg and it is hard to disagree with that sentiment. There is relief, you feel, that his cards are now on the table as opposed to in his pocket. But one last question: did he have Riley’s speakers?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘No, I swear,’ he laughs. ‘I’m still not sure if he’s found them!’</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Mark Clattenburg is refereeing at the CONIFA World Football Cup in London, which you can watch on the Paddy Power Facebook page.

She banked $18million from sponsors but that was still not enough to pierce the top 100.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">With the greatest respect to them and their coaching teams, the 23-year-old Greek pro basketball player Giannis Antetokounmpo (30th) can’t hold a candle to the spectacle, the style and the capacity to inspire which Williams brings. Kei Nishikori (35th) is a pale imitation, too.</p><img id="i-1f9eb82054299a8f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/22/4CF3BD9500000578-0-image-a-41_1528234137621.jpg" height="858" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The absence of women will perhaps serve a purpose in focusing attention on the gender pay divide in sport, which is a growing embarrassment to those governing bodies who like to think they exude modernity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Consider the study of annual pay in the world’s top sports leagues compiled by Sporting Intelligence earlier this year. It revealed that the £32.9m earned from PSG last season by Neymar — fifth in the new Forbes list — is almost exactly the same as 1,693 female players in France, Germany, England, the US, Sweden, Australia and Mexico combined.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The colossal sums paid out to US basketball and baseball stars means that the Forbes list even puts the eye-popping Premier League salaries in the shade. </p><img id="i-77e23411e5fb57ed" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/22/4CF237AA00000578-0-image-a-42_1528234166818.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Floyd Mayweather still dominates the earnings rankings, despite retiring from boxing" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Only three of the league’s players make it — Paul Pogba (52nd), Wayne Rooney (58th) and Sergio Aguero (86th). And the UK sportsmen are put firmly in their place by the vast American earners, too. Only Lewis Hamilton, Rory McIlroy, Gareth Bale and Rooney make it in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The list has the potential to devastate the fragile ego of Cristiano Ronaldo, who held the crown for the previous two years. Mayweather now dwarfs him, but Lionel Messi edges him into third, having signed a new contract.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet the petty rivalries at the top are an insignificance, considering that the pay league does not consider a single woman worthy of a place in the 100 best earners. Good luck to anyone trying to tell Ronaldo that.</p><div>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">England's recruitment of Brad Shields has been accepted by the national squad, but not within the international corridors of power, as World Rugby vice-chairman Agustin Pichot expressed his outrage on Tuesday night.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The former Argentina captain has been a driving force behind the governing body's attempts to reform Test eligibility criteria, having made no secret of his concerns about the global movement of players, to represent other countries. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When a New Zealand broadcaster described the image of Kiwi back-rower Shields in England kit as a 'sad picture', Pichot responded on Twitter by saying: 'Something is missing. We are losing something… the game is losing something…' </p><img id="i-60ee53182c8357b1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/21/4CECC2F300000578-0-New_arrival_Brad_Shields_has_taken_part_in_his_first_England_tra-a-2_1528228897335.jpg" height="516" width="634" alt="New arrival Brad Shields took part in his first England training session on Tuesday" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-2702c28c6b4b0832" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/21/4CF264EE00000578-0-image-m-5_1528229065381.jpg" height="349" width="634" alt="" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shields played for New Zealand at age-group level and started at blindside in the 2011 junior World Cup Final, against an England team featuring men he is now training alongside in the Red Rose squad - George Ford, Owen Farrell, Mako Vunipola, Elliot Daly and Dan Robson. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His parents were born in England and emigrated when they were young children, but have returned to the UK in recent times and are understood to now live in Berkshire.</p><div>

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">When challenged on his stance, Pichot added: 'It depends in each case and how many years you have lived and loved the country and jersey you are representing. Can we measure that? By parents? Grandparents? Years? Very difficult. I have my personal opinion.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no doubting that - according to the guidelines - Shields qualifies and Eddie Jones wasted no time in picking him at the earliest opportunity, once it was confirmed that he would be joining Wasps this summer. But Pichot has raised fears about a diluting of national identity in the Test game.</p><img id="i-7081947fa0252b8a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/21/4CF26CD100000578-0-image-a-1_1528228894362.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="England's recruitment of Shields has dismayed World Rugby vice-chairman Agustin Pichot" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When you have players who haven't lived in the country that they represent, it's not great,' he said when previously asked about the divisive subject. 'I think it is very important to keep the identity of our national teams. I think having on your team players who have not lived (for long) in the country… it's not right.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chris Robshaw insisted on Tuesday that Shields has 'fitted in well', since joining up with the squad on Sunday night, after a flight over from Wellington, where he plays for the Hurricanes in Super Rugby. The Harlequins flanker claimed the players pay little heed to the debate about this new challenger to his status as England's first-choice No 6.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, Joe Launchbury missed training  with a calf injury, which he is thought to have suffered during training in Bagshot late last week, prior to departure for South Africa. </p><img id="i-e6aecc8a608a740f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/21/4CECC20300000578-0-The_Hurricanes_captain_and_flanker_has_flown_from_New_Zealand_to-a-4_1528228924444.jpg" height="831" width="634" alt="The Hurricanes captain and flanker played for New Zealand at age-group level" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Wasps lock would be a certain starter against the Springboks at Ellis Park on Sunday if fit, but scrum coach Neal Hatley said: 'It's hard to tell how much of a doubt he is.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We've just got to make sure that Joe is fit to play 80 minutes. If he is not fit to play 80 minutes then we'd expect Nick Isiekwe or Jonny Hill to step up and fill those shoes.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Sportsmail </span>understands that the Red Rose management are optimistic Launchbury will be cleared to play, and they may even provisionally pick him in the starting XV tomorrow for the series opener, subject to the 27-year-old passing a fitness test on Friday.</p><div>

The 25-year-old, also pursued by the likes of Crystal Palace and Newcastle, has put pen to paper on a four-year contract at London Stadium and will arrive after the expiration of his current Fulham deal on July 1. 'It's amazing for this deal to finally happen,' Fredericks told West Ham's official website.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">When Rochdale's Joe Thompson capped his second recovery from cancer by scoring the goal which kept his side in League One it completed a fitting end to an emotional story. It also meant that neighbours Oldham Athletic, founder members of the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/sport/premierleague/index.html" id="mol-152bd300-68d0-11e8-8bbf-754bd4a91963">Premier League</a>, completed their 24-year slide from top division to bottom. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What follows is a staggering tale of wasted investment and belief-defying decision-making that has resulted in serious concerns that the Lancashire club may become football's next Leyton Orient. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In late-January, Oldham announced that they had been taken over by Dubai-based Moroccan Abdallah Lemsagam, a former agent. The reality was that Lemsagam had actually been providing the funds to keep the club operating since the start of their 21st consecutive season in League One. His arrival coincided with an influx of foreign players, predominantly French-speaking, at his recommendation. </p><img id="i-ea12ecc8b601caae" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/15/4CF0980800000578-5808305-image-a-132_1528209701539.jpg" height="439" width="634" alt="Oldham Athletic are in danger of becoming football's next Leyton Orient due to financial woes" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many were signed on wages previously well outside Oldham's budget. Midfielder Mohamed Maouche was given £4,000-a-week. He subsequently played 10 minutes of League One football (and remains on the payroll). The biggest name, however, was a Dutch Under 21 winger Queensy Menig, who joined on loan from French club Nantes. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It can be disclosed that Menig was paid a mind-boggling sum of around £11,650-a-week, plus accommodation at Manchester's swanky Malmaison hotel. 'I wanted to give the fans a present, to make them dream,' Lemsagam told <span class="mol-style-italic">Sportsmail</span>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whilst the intention would appear to be admirable, the reality was that Menig caused more problems than he solved and departed following four starts and one goal. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Insiders say the experiment in total cost around £500,000. The wastage continued. Deals for three key loan players had to be renegotiated in January. The weekly bill for the three, one of whom signed permanently, went from £3,750 to around £16,000. As a result of actions like the above, Oldham's wage budget abruptly spiralled from around £1.4m to a frightening figure approaching £2.4m.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The scattergun recruitment did not have the desired effect on the pitch and tempers frayed. In mid-April, Oldham were leading Gillingham 1-0 and looked like picking up an incredibly important three points. They did not know it at the time, but victory would have kept them up. In injury-time Wilfried Moimbe, another new arrival from France, reacted to a foul in the area by throwing a punch. He was sent off, the visitors scored the resulting penalty and three points became one.</p><img id="i-442199eb0365de4e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/15/4CF098C400000578-5808305-image-a-154_1528210024945.jpg" height="415" width="634" alt="Club owner Abdallah Lemsagam has promised to make funds available after staff were unpaid" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">At half-time during a vital home match with Southend United, and with Oldham losing 1-0, Lemsagam entered the dressing room. He says it was to support his players. Others say he left after looking around the room without saying a word. Regardless, one senior player visited the owner to plead with him not to do it again. Oldham lost 3-0. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At a training session at Brentford, before another key away match at Wimbledon, one player reacted with audible dismay when informed that he would not be starting. Later, he was told to come to the front of the room at the hotel in which the team were staying, and apologise to his team mates. 'It was disastrous for morale,' said one onlooker. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On another occasion, a striker denied a lucrative January move to a club closer to his home, almost came to blows with the new owner. His form subsequently dipped dramatically and Oldham are now keen to sell him. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And then there is the case of Ousmane Fane. Fane, an energetic midfielder signed from Kidderminster in 2016, was called to see the chairman following 'disciplinary issues' and told to stay away from the club with two games left to save the season. Lemsagam claims this move was made with the backing of manager Richie Wellens, who told him that he did not need the player. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fane had previously played in 46 games. Without him, Oldham could only muster two draws and their departure from a division they had occupied since 1997 was confirmed with Thompson's goal.</p><img id="i-b9b81e520c9efe13" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/15/4CF09BAC00000578-5808305-image-a-152_1528209913188.jpg" height="443" width="634" alt="Midfielder Ousmane Fane was banished with two games to go having played 46 games prior" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Amid this backdrop comes more serious issues. Wages have not been paid on time for the last six months. On one occasion, a player claimed he could not turn up for training because he had no money to put petrol in his car. A member of office staff is understood to have taken out a credit card before Christmas to enable them to buy presents. Some members of staff have still not picked up their salaries from April. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On Thursday, the latest payday, a handful of office staff and no players or playing staff received their wages. On Monday that remained the case. A number of agents have told <span class="mol-style-italic">Sportsmail</span> they will no longer allow their players to sign for Oldham because there is no confidence that they will be paid. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Three members of staff have departed and are considering taking the club to an employment tribunal. And the bills pile up. A fortnight ago club members of staff spent around a week unable to use their mobile phones because O2's account had not been settled. A dispute with a company brought in to look after the pitch is heading for court. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Payments for tickets sold for away matches last season have not been paid to a number of clubs including local rivals Bury and Rochdale. Contributors to the programme have not received their relatively-tiny amounts since December. And then there is the big one. A bill of around £130,000 to HMRC has gone unpaid. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are fears winding-up proceedings may not be far away and insiders have genuine concerns that the end could well be nigh for the 123-year-old club. Lemsagam, externally at least, remains calm. He says that he is 'cleaning up' a vast array of issues inherited from the previous regime led by former owner Simon Corney, who declined to comment for this piece. He may well have a point and there has to be some sympathy, but increasing the wage bill by £1m on players who could not prevent relegation was a disastrous move.</p><img id="i-c740ac500c946d5f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/15/4CF093C600000578-5808305-image-a-153_1528209916858.jpg" height="405" width="634" alt="Boss Richie Wellens is trying to add to his squad but needs to know if players can be paid" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lemsagam adds that he has struggled to transfer money because the club's presumably fed-up bank do not want their business any more as a result of longstanding issues triggered before he took over. He promises that more funds will arrive in the next few days. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is a realisation that mistakes regarding recruitment have been made and that a more realistic budget is needed for the club's first campaign in League Two. Oldham have since agreed terms with former player Jose Baxter to much accolade from fans. However, whether they can pay the ex-Everton playmaker remains to be seen. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lemsagam, who says he took over the club, surrounded by Manchester giants United and City, because he identified its 'potential', does not want to make predictions but believes he can lead the club to profit this year. It would be some achievement. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Professional Footballers Association and the EFL, whose ownership test Lemsagam passed, are monitoring what appears to be a desperate situation. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I honestly fear for the future of the club,' one former player told <span class="mol-style-italic">Sportsmail</span>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the meantime, the phone keeps ringing. </p><div>

However players with the wealth of top level experience Lichtsteiner has are in short supply, having spent 10 years with top Italian clubs Lazio and Juventus.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Emery hinted that Lichtsteiner's wise head is his most valuable asset in his statement to the club website: 'Stephan brings huge experience and leadership to our squad. He's a player with great quality with a very positive and determined attitude. Stephan will improve us on and off the pitch.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How important will he be off the pitch?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Arsenal's off-pitch figurehead, Per Mertesacker, has retired from playing, and although he remains at Arsenal in the backroom staff, having someone who has seen the footballing world and won a trophy cabinet's worth of silver among the playing staff will be immensely valuable.</p><img id="i-289a55f95026d8bb" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/15/47DC491A00000578-5808145-image-a-66_1528209569778.jpg" height="439" width="634" alt="Lichtsteiner will replace Per Mertesacker as an experienced head in the dressing room" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Will he start for Arsenal?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lichtsteiner will be competing with Hector Bellerin for the starting right back spot, and it would appear at first glance as if the pacy young Spaniard would be the top pick, especially as Lichtsteiner is not a different type of player - he loves to bomb forwards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, Emery mighty take a cue for Lichtsteiner's role in the Juventus team of 2016-17, when Dani Alves was the other right back. Lichtsteiner played only 73 minutes of Champions League football as Juve reached the final, but made 26 league appearances. A similar arrangement - one player starts in the league, the other in the cups - could be the way forward.</p><img id="i-8f186706b4bdcf2a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/15/4B970EFD00000578-5808145-image-a-67_1528209602348.jpg" height="440" width="634" alt="Hector Bellern and Lichtsteiner could share duties at right back for Emery's Gunners" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Can he cut it at the top level?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">No matter how dominant Juventus might be domestically, winning seven league titles on the spin is not an achievement to be sniffed at. Lichtsteiner will bring a winning mentality to Arsenal - he is not used to finishing fifth or sixth, 30 or 40 points off the winners.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also impressed against Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter final; coming off the bench after 17 minutes following an injury, his attacking, warrior-like style of battling play almost helped produce an all-time great comeback.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Add this to the fact he could make his 100th international appearance in Switzerland's World Cup opener against Brazil, and you have a player who lives at the top level.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Can he inspire a return to the top four?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Arsenal clearly need much more serious maintenance in order to seriously challenge for a first league title since 2004, but Lichtsteiner appears to be a step in the right direction.</p><img id="i-614e53310743dd34" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/15/4CF00B7A00000578-5808145-image-a-69_1528209774374.jpg" height="448" width="634" alt="Lichtsteiner proved against Real Madrid that he can still cut it at the top level of football" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Anthony Joshua is close to tying up deals for his next two fights, with Alexander Povetkin increasingly likely to be his next opponent and Deontay Wilder signing up for a blockbuster in early 2019.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A fight with Wilder, the WBC champion, has long been the preferred choice for September but those plans are set to be put back as US broadcasters do not want a clash with Canelo Alvarez’s comeback fight following his drugs ban.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has created a scenario where Povetkin, the mandatory challenger for Joshua’s WBA title, is likely to fill a September slot, with Wilder expected to contest a unification bout with Joshua in February or March. Talks with both parties have been taking place simultaneously, with deals close on each front.</p><img id="i-f404a363873b939f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/12/04FCCDCA000007D0-0-image-a-26_1528197295307.jpg" height="482" width="634" alt="Eddie Hearn believes that Anthony Joshua (above) will face Alexander Povetkin in his next fight" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-7033316eabfae160" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/12/153C83F9000005DC-0-image-m-28_1528197471158.jpg" height="646" width="634" alt="WBC champion Povetkin could face Joshua either late this year or early next year" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">There remains a chance that Wilder will be the next fight, with dates in October and November under consideration, but promoter Eddie Hearn said his ‘gut feeling’ is that Joshua will fight Povetkin in September and then face Wilder in early 2019.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: ‘I believe we will get a deal done with Deontay quite soon.

He will fight Wilder in his next two fights.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But my gut feeling right now is that Povetkin will be the next fight, in September.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A fight between Povetkin and Joshua, the IBF, WBO and WBA champion, would be in Britain, with London most likely. Povetkin, the 2004 Olympic champion, has 34 wins and only one defeat against Wladimir Klitschko from 35 fights, with the most recent being a fifth-round knockout of David Price on Joshua’s undercard in March. </p><div>


</div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Eddie Hearn says his 'gut feeling' is that Anthony Joshua will face Alexander Povetkin in his next fight, despite being close to an agreement with Deontay Wilder after lengthy talks. A fight with Wilder in September appears highly unlikely because US broadcasters do not want to clash with Canelo Alvarez's comeback from a drugs ban. That unification fight with the WBC champion has now been slated for two possible windows, with dates in October and November considered, or a slot in February or March. </dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Jeorge Bird</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T00:30:38.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Hearn reveals Joshua is likely to face Povetkin  in his next fight</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T00:30:38.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Anthony Joshua</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-5806063/Saunders-line-GGG-Canelo-clash-injury.html" title="Injury put paid to Billy Joe Saunders' clash with Martin Murray... but could yet pave the way for megafight with Canelo Alvarez or Gennady Golovkin"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-5805193/Joshua-unlikely-face-Wilder-February-2019-Hearn-admits.html" title="Anthony Joshua unlikely to face Deontay Wilder until February 2019 as Eddie Hearn admits Alexander Povetkin showdown will be AJ's next move unless a deal is done THIS WEEK"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-5795513/Tyson-Fury-sends-fresh-warning-Anthony-Joshua-Deontay-Wilder-ahead-comeback-fight.html" title="'I am going to expose them': Tyson Fury sends fresh warning to Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder as he closes in on comeback fight"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-5790325/Deontay-Wilder-claims-hell-cruiserweight-unified-heavyweight-division.html" title="Deontay Wilder claims he'll take over cruiserweight once he has unified heavyweight division as Anthony Joshua talks reach crucial stage"></link></item><item><title>Sergio Ramos struts back into Spain squad with his Real Madrid Champions League winners...and lets Diego Costa know who's in charge at World Cup training camp</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5807503/Sergio-Ramos-Real-Madrid-team-mates-meet-Spain-time.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jun 2018 11:12:40 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5807503</guid><description><![CDATA[Players from the Champions League winners were given extra time off following their victory over Liverpool in Kiev on May 26 and Ramos joked around at the photoshoot.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Pep did everything to spoil my last season. He was cruel with me,' said Toure. 'Do you really think he could've been like that with Andres Iniesta? It got to the point I asked myself if it was because of my colour. I am not the first. Other Barcelona players asked the question.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Maybe us Africans aren't always treated the same by certain people. When you see the problems (Pep) has often had with African players, everywhere he has been, I ask myself questions. He is too intelligent to be caught. He will never admit it. But the day he picks a team with five Africans in it, I promise I will send him a cake.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, in an lengthy interview with Russian outlet <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://sport24.ru/news/football/2018-06-05-intervyu-agenta-dmitriya-selyuka-o-konflikte-trenera-manchester-siti-pepa-gvardioly-i-afrikanskogo-poluzashchitnika-yaya-ture">Sport24</a>, Seluk has warned the City boss of an 'African curse' and insisted Toure would be happy to play for another club in the Premier League's top six for a lowly wage of £1 per-week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Yaya knows Guardiola like no other,' he said. 'He worked with him both in Barcelona and in Manchester City. With all the desire, nothing good about the human qualities of Guardiola can be said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'God sees everything. As a man who acted with Yaya, the legend of the club, which under different pretexts did not give the opportunity to go on the field. He turned all Africa against himself, many African fans turned away from Manchester City.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And I'm sure that many African shamans in the future will not allow Guardiola to win the Champions League. This will be for Guardiola an African curse. Life will show whether I am right or not.'  </p><img id="i-1c044e5d4c847cca" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/12/4CE8786600000578-5807491-image-a-52_1528197244110.jpg" height="433" width="634" alt="In his final campaign his relationship with Guardiola deteriorated and he made only one start" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-378d60880466fca8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/12/023C99F7000007D0-5807491-image-a-53_1528197362020.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Seluk  claimed Guardiola announced his arrival early to disrupt Manuel Pellegrini's final season" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Toure played under Guardiola at Barcelona, winning the Champions League in 2009 as well as two league titles and a Spanish Cup. However, the two men never looked at ease with each other when Guardiola succeeded Manuel Pellegrini at City two summers ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Seluk bemoaned how the Spaniard first came to the Etihad Stadium and claimed he announced his arrival early purely to disrupt Pellegrini's final season at the helm.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You can start with the fact that he came to Manchester City in a nasty manner. The transfer was announced at a time when Pellegrini, his co-worker in the coaching department, was still at the helm of the team,' he added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Guardiola was afraid that Pellegrini would win the championship and other tournaments that season, as he did before he came to Bayern Munich, when Jupp Heynckes won all that is possible. Guardiola could not repeat the achievements of Heynckes, being the next three years at the helm of the best German club, which without Guardiola again leads and wins. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'What did Guardiola achieve? In two years he won the same as Mancini or Pellegrini. And Pellegrini reached the semi-finals of the Champions League, and Guardiola – not yet. Manchester City has now extended the contract with him for three years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I bet that Guardiola will not win the Champions League during this time, no matter how much money he has spent, but he likes to do it. When only £200million is spent on the line of defence, when money is not counted…</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Perhaps, many will say that this is the style of Guardiola, that he plays enchanting football. Only when you buy all the best players in the world, it's much easier than, for example, in the case of (Claudio) Ranieri, who won the Premier League with Leicester.'</p><img id="i-7035219cd891b242" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/12/4CE839C300000578-5807491-image-a-55_1528197575707.jpg" height="831" width="634" alt="Seluk insisted the Toure could still be of use to other members of the Premier League's top six" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-b7f236f6b7ceb877" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/12/4CEE35BD00000578-5807491-image-a-67_1528198031738.jpg" height="433" width="634" alt="Toure's agent has promised his client will prove Guardiola wrong in England next season" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a free agent, Seluk insisted the veteran could still be of use to the other members of the Premier League's top six and claimed next season will be focused on proving Guardiola wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Now Yaya has many offers from different countries, where they are ready to pay a lot of money, but we decided to dedicate the next season to Guardiola. And to prove and show the fans of Manchester City that Yaya is not finished with football. He is full of energy and wants to play this season in England,' he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'At a time when huge sums are being spent in England for the purchase of football players, I officially declare that Yaya is ready to move as a free agent to any English club in the top six with a salary of £1 a week – but for certain successes to make a bonus system.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I believe that a player like Yaya would not harm Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham and Liverpool. Yaya – the winner. And never before has a top footballer with leadership qualities harmed any club, especially when it is not necessary to pay for it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Manchester City declined to comment on Monday night. </p><div>

Verstappen, 20, has stood on the podium only once in the six races so far this season and has had two retirements-- while Australian team mate Daniel Ricciardo has won twice. The youngster has also drawn plenty of comment and criticism for his errors.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Alex Martin</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-05T15:00:20.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Max Verstappen 'soul-searching' after Monaco crash</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-05T15:00:20.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-5779633/Lewis-Hamilton-plays-claims-Daniel-Ricciardo-join-Mercedes-year.html" title="'I would imagine his future is at Red Bull': Lewis Hamilton plays down claims that Daniel Ricciardo could join him at Mercedes next year"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-5778887/Prince-Albert-open-changing-Monaco-GP-not-time.html" title="Lewis Hamilton is right to criticise the Monaco Grand Prix for being boring...
