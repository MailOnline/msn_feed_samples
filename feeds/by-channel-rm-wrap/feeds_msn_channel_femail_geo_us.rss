<p class="mol-para-with-font">When you're considering making renovations to your home, often the thought of adding value to the property when it comes to selling can be a deciding factor. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, experts have revealed that while most improvements will increase the potential asking price, the added value is not always greater than what you spend in the first place. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">GoCompare has teamed up with property expert Henry Pryor who is a regular fixture on <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/bbc/index.html" id="mol-e8829ea0-6998-11e8-a660-fd9861a9f977">BBC</a> Breakfast and Radio 4's Today programme, to identify the upgrades that are really worth your money. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His findings reveal that the most profitable home improvement is installing a new boiler for a cost of £2,000 which will add £8,000 in value, making you a profit of £6,000. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Increasing home security and energy saving measures are also worth your while, but updating bathrooms and kitchens and putting in new flooring won't add more value than what you've spent, leaving you at a loss. </p><img id="i-6cf53ba52423b9b8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/15/4CF97CE100000578-0-image-a-51_1528294216052.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="Installing a new boiler is the most profitable addition you can make to your home, adding £8,000 in value for the cost of less than £2,000" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's therefore that you think carefully why you are spending extra money and who will benefit,' he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'My advice is usually 'spend money on the things that you want and leave other improvements to the next person who may not share your taste. </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Most people who are thinking of selling their home or looking to improve it to add value will consider the merits of a trip to the DIY store, some will even

She said that you should always dream big and ask yourself - 'What if your life could be anything that you wanted it to be? What if you could achieve anything that you set your mind to?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alyse said it was a lot of trial and error as well as experimenting with new things but she tries to think of everything as a learning experience because, 'even if something didn't do so well there's always something I can learn from it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A  very important piece of the puzzle that has allowed Alyse to continue growing and expanding she admits is accepting help which she has done a lot over the past few years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I have accepted help from so many different people in so many different ways. The truth is that I haven't done this all on my own that's just not possible. When we open up ourselves and accept help from others we're also opening up ourselves to so much more growth.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for people who are too scared to ask for help, Alyse said, 'I know that it could be hard to ask for support and accept help from others but if we want to grow at a more rapid rate it's essential to allow yourself to receive help.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fourth is prioritizing health which she says  is so important when it comes to manifesting your dreams and achieving your goals.</p><mol-permabox id="mol-5698bfc0-6988-11e8-a04c-7523876330f5"></mol-permabox><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Nutrition is incredibly important because fueling and nourishing your body will help you thrive. Less process food and more fresh food as well as figuring out how many hours of sleep is ideal for you and getting in tune with your body is essential she says. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When I'm feeling good in my mind as well as my body and I feel like I have a clear head, I feel like things manifest and happen so much quicker and easier,' she admits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lastly, Alyse says believing in yourself is key as well as becoming aware of your limiting beliefs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I have spent years trying to get those limiting thoughts and beliefs out of my head. Change the voice in your head and change the story. I can't stress enough how important it is to positively affirm what you are capable of instead of telling yourself that you're not worthy, you're not capable and you're not deserving,' Alyse shared.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You literally need to train yourself to think differently and more positively even if it feels like a lie in the beginning continue on with it anyway. Every single day wake up and tell yourself "I am capable and I am worthy of living in abundance and fulfillment in every single aspect of life,"' she continued.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Alyse Brautigam dropped out of college to pursue her dreams of living in Hawaii arriving with just $500 to her name.

New Yorker Leah Melby Clinton, 32, said she walked down the aisle solo because her parents divorced when she was young, and she didn't want to hurt either of their feelings. Meanwhile, 33-year-old Abby Sherwood's parents didn't support her decision to marry her wife due to religious reasons, so she walked herself down the aisle. For Mallory Cooke, 31, who is from Tennessee, the decision to walk by herself was about keeping her late father's memory alive. At her wedding to Prince Harry, Meghan, 36, walked down the first half of the aisle by herself, before she was joined by Prince Charles.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Charlie Lankston</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T15:43:42.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Three brides reveal why they walked themselves down the aisle</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T15:43:42.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Meghan Markle</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5809569/Kensington-Palace-reveals-cards-sent-Harry-Meghans-wedding-Prince-Louis-birth.html" title="Kensington Palace shares a snap of the VERY cute cards sent to mark Harry and Meghan's wedding, Prince Louis' birth and Charlotte's birthday - and they've received 36,000 in the last month alone"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5808097/Danny-DeVito-poses-set-cardboard-cutout-high-schooler-Allison-Closs-took-prom.html" title="Returning the favor!

exciting parts of becoming a new parent. However, due to a number of unusual and offensive choices made by parents in the past, governments in both Australia and New Zealand have had to ban a number of 'names' from being registered. Here, FEMAIL looks at the names banned from use across the two countries and reasons why certain monikers have been prohibited. Names like Saint (top right is Saint West with Kim Kardashian) and Queen (bottom right is Queen Elizabeth) are banned due to royal and religious connotations.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Sheree Mutton</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T08:47:19.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>The baby names BANNED after parents tried to use them</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T08:47:19.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5801823/Constance-Hall-shares-post-baby-bump-just-days-giving-birth-son-Raja-Wolf.html" title="'I still look six months pregnant but I'm going to flaunt it everywhere I go': Constance Hall shares photo of her post-baby bump to break stigma for new mums just days after giving birth to her son Raja Wolf"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5769565/The-Australian-baby-names-2018-revealed.html" title="From Bodhi and Jude to Luna and Isla: The top Australian baby names for 2018 revealed - and the monikers that are gone for GOOD"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.bdm.vic.gov.au/home/births/name+your+child/" title="Name your child - Births, Deaths &amp; Marriages Victoria"></link></item><item><title>Red hot!

<p class="mol-para-with-font">A writer has revealed how the key to happiness is to stop worrying about being nicer and more patient and embrace your inner d***. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">German-born Alexandra Reinwarth is a bestselling author of over 30 books, now living in <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/spain/index.html" id="mol-05439500-688e-11e8-b7d1-097ee9617fc4">Spain</a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Good Girl’s Guide To Being A D***, already an international bestseller, is the first of her books to be translated into English and is launched in the UK this week. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was inspired to write the book after finally telling a difficult friend she didn't want to be around her anymore, and now wants to inspire others to live happier lives by letting go of their constant need to please. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'In a today’s world, which is getting more and more ruthless, it is more necessary than ever to stand up for your opinion, for your beliefs and to say "No", for you and for others,' she told Femail.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There are two groups of people: the ones who think of other people in a way like: how can I help you, what can I offer you that could be useful in your situation?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The others are more like: how could your existence be useful for me? I’m the first group. And we are nice – too nice.</p><img id="i-f940dbe16bdaaf2d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/07/03D9B64C000003E8-5804281-image-a-1_1528181473200.jpg" height="470" width="634" alt="German-born Alexandra Reinwarth was inspired to write the book after finally telling a difficult friend she didn't want to be around her anymore (stock image) " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We wish to please everyone, want to be liked by our boss and our collegues, by the doctor and also by the grumpy waiter in the pizzeria next door – not mentioning family and friends. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We are constantly trying not to embarrass ourselves and to be considerate of others.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don’t get me wrong, that’s a good thing.

Everything else is fake.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We probably won’t turn into besties, but whenever Granny comes visiting now, I am not stressed any more. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I don’t have to prepare anything; I can remain relaxed, because I no longer have to play-act.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>UNWANTED ADVICE </strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Whether it's your mother's opinion on your parenting methods or your friend's insistence that you should go vegan, advice that makes you want to tear your hair out can be dealt with using an 'agree to disagree' strategy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Try something like this: ‘Yes, I can see what you mean, but I see that differently and I don’t really want to discuss it now. Let’s just tuck into this gorgeous cake instead. Do you want another piece?’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remember: With friendliness you don’t have to give a toss about all the topics that cause you to inwardly roll your eyes. Nobody will be cross with you if you publicly disagree about something (in case it is something you do happen to care about) as long as you keep being friendly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This strategy also has a nice side effect: you are not shying away from saying what you think – and that feels really, really good.</p><img id="i-713d435a27f7a6f1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/07/058AF86F000003E8-5804281-image-a-2_1528181918737.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Unsolicited advice about parenting is easily warded off by appearing to agree to disagree (stock image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>OFFICE COLLECTIONS </strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alexandra made a decision not opt out of the birthday collection which is usually organised by a woman called Michelle for her own gratification, while the person celebrating ends up with a pair of unicorn slippers they don't want.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The only thing that keeps me from putting this plan into action is what Michelle might think of me when I tell her I don’t want her to count me in any more, and what the others may think when my name is no longer on their birthday cards,' she said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I ponder and ponder, but always come to the same conclusion: really, I really don’t care. Does Sandra from accounts approve of my actions? It simply doesn’t matter.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>AFTER WORK DRINKS</strong></strong>  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These days, Alexandra would prefer to go home to her son or enjoy quality time to herself than go for drinks after work but it took her a while to feel confident in saying she won't join the weekly excursion to a nearby gin bar.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She recalled: 'I take a deep breath and simply say it. That I won’t come. Not today and not on any other Friday in the future, because after work I prefer to go home. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Also, I don’t particularly like gin. My sentences are still a little clumsy, but after the next person asks it gets better. </p><img id="i-74c52f7dc73bc415" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/16/4CE7F2FD00000578-0-image-a-27_1528125616941.jpg" height="470" width="306" alt="The Good Girl¿s Guide To Being A D***, already an international bestseller, is the first of her books to be translated into English and is launched in the UK this week" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">'At the end of the day, when one of the trainees asks me the same question, I have progressed to: "Nope. Not for a million dollars! But have fun!". Life can be so easy.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>CHARITY COLLECTORS/SALESPEOPLE </strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The only thing that still makes you vulnerable is pity,' Alexandra said revealing why you shouldn't feel sorry for charity collectors or anyone trying to sell you something.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'How about: ‘One question – if I have a little financial crisis in the future, maybe because I have not said no often enough to people like you, could I come to you for help? Could I just visit you and explain my personal situation, and would you be so kind as to help me out? </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'What, you don’t want me to come and see you at home? Oh, so you don’t seem to like it when strangers ring your doorbell and want money from you? Well, well. You sound just like me, then.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You don’t even have to say it aloud; it is the thought that will change your attitude. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Since it dawned on me that I am not allowed to ring the telephone guy or the electricity people at home and that the man with the double-glazing would be outraged if I turned up on his doorstep, I slam my front door with such force that its hinges quiver.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And without the slightest trace of a bad conscience.

But dukedom can only be inherited by male children — not female — regardless of birth order. So if Harry and Meghan — who are rumored to want to start a family right away — welcome a boy as their first child, he will one day inherit his dad's title, Duke of Sussex. But if there first child is a girl, she will simply be called 'Lady'. In 2013, the Succession to the Crown Act changed the law regarding succession to the throne so it is based on birth order, regardless of gender. This means that William and Kate's daughter, Princess Charlotte, follows her older brother George in the line of succession to the throne, however that law applies to those in line for the crown, not members of the peerage.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Charlie Lankston</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-05T01:54:15.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Prince Harry &amp; Meghan's future daughter won't inherit a title</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-05T01:54:15.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Royals,Prince Harry,Meghan Markle</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5804919/Meghan-Markles-chef-ex-expecting-child-singer-girlfriend.html" title="Moving on!

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The doting mom mostly keeps Louis, now eight, and Laila, six, out of the public eye, which hasn't been easy.

And everyone wanted photos. It was heartbreaking,' she went on. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Louis would hear a helicopter or drone, and he’d run to get his sister and drag her across the lawn and hide her under the trampoline. So poor Laila had PTSD. But it took the bounty off once we did those official photos.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She has also been speaking lately about characterizing adopted children as such. When speaking about how many children are in foster care and looking for homes, she got emotional once again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Look: I’m all for Republican, Democrat, whatever, but don’t talk to me about what I can or can’t do with my body until you’ve taken care of every child who doesn’t have a home or is neglected or abused,' she said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It makes me teary-eyed. Let’s all just refer to these kids as "our kids." Don’t say "my adopted child." No one calls their kid their "IVF child" or their "oh, s***, I went to a bar and got knocked-up child." Let just say, "our children."</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Actress Sandra Bullock, 53, teared up as she discussed motherhood and how her children are now her number one priority with Today show host Hoda Kotb.

Most wore suits with cropped trousers that came up above their ankles. LeBron and Jordan Clarkson both wore suits with suit shorts. The team made headlines in May when they wore matching Thom Browne suits to a game. The tradition to wear matching suits was started by Dwyane Wade before he was traded and his now being spearheaded by LeBron.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Charlie Lankston</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-01T18:52:29.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>LeBron James wore a shorts suit to Game 1 of the NBA Finals</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-01T18:52:29.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nba/article-5794491/LeBron-James-tells-reporter-better-tomorrow-J-R-Smith-quiz.html" title="'Do better tomorrow': LeBron James' message for reporters as he coolly walks out of press conference with his sunglasses and man bag after repeatedly being grilled over Cavs' clanger in NBA Finals "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5794125/Hilarious-memes-mock-JR-Smith-Cavaliers-guard-mistakenly-thought-team-ahead.html" title="'How you hearing yanny?': Hilarious memes mock JR Smith after Cavaliers guard mistakenly thought his team was ahead with seconds to play in a tie game - drawing priceless reaction from exasperated LeBron James"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5793607/Tristan-Thompson-shoves-ball-face-Warriors-player-ejection-overtime-NBA-FInals.html" title="Tristan Thompson shoves ball in face of Warriors player after ejection during overtime of NBA Finals"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/style/cleveland-cavaliers-lebron-james-thom-browne-.html" title="In the N.B.A., a Game of Clothes Horse - The New York Times"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.gq.com/story/cleveland-cavaliers-thom-browne-breakdown" title="Are the Cleveland Cavaliers’ Stylish-as-Hell Thom Browne Suits Helping? | GQ"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2018/05/31/nba-finals-why-did-lebron-james-wear-shorts-suit-game-1/662227002/" title="www.usatoday.com..."></link></item><item><title>Britain's highest-ranking transgender soldier and her new actor husband who was ALSO born the wrong gender jet off for their romantic honeymoon - and declare 'everyone deserves to be happy' </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5792101/Transgender-newlyweds-jet-romantic-honeymoon-defying-odds-marry.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 14:30:25 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5792101</guid><description><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE: Jake and Hannah Graf, who are now based in Sandhurst, are enjoying their honeymoon in Tel Aviv.

DON'T APPLY EYELINER ON THE INNER LASH LINE </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While the tightlining technique is all the rage on beauty blogs, Mr Arundel warns against this cosmetic method. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Optometrists call the fragile skin around the eyes 'periocular skin' and they have a strong opinion about where on that skin you should apply your eyeliner,' he said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There has even been a small study to set the record straight about the dangers of what beauticians refer to as 'waterlining' or 'tightlining' which is applying eyeliner inside your lower lash line.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The study quantified the migration of a conventional cosmetic eye pencil in two different locations: behind the lash line and inside the lash line (the waterline). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The results showed the glitter particles of the pencil eyeliner migrated more readily and contaminated the tear film when applied inside the waterline. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Arundel said this has 'implications for contact wearers and patients with dry eye syndrome or sensitive eyes'. </p><img id="i-c4b6d7644d4237c1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/29/09/40E818FA00000578-4551502-image-a-2_1496048207375.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Optometry Australia's resident optometrist, Luke Arundel, has seen first-hand the damage caused by cosmetic mistakes and shared his top beauty tips to help women avoid eye  damage" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. THROW OUT YOUR MAKE UP AFTER THE EXPIRY DATE </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While many people keep their make up for a long while, this could be causing serious damage to their eyes.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'A study published in the International Journal of Cosmetic Science found 97.9 per cent of participants reported using or previously using make-up after the expiration date, with mascara being the most frequently mentioned product,' Mr Arundel said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Yet, the microbiological analysis of 40 mascara samples revealed the presence of bacteria and fungi which can cause nasty bacterial eye infections.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'By law, cosmetic manufacturers don't have to put a use-by date on their products. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, you can check a product's official expiry date by running the batch code through checkfresh.com or apps like Check Your Cosmetics.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. BE CAREFUL WITH EYELASH EXTENSIONS </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eyelash extensions have skyrocketed in popularity of late... but they can be risky. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to Mr Arundel, risks associated with this beauty trend include infections of the cornea and eyelid, the permanent or temporary loss of eyelashes, eyelid swelling and allergic reactions. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'There has been a steady increase in the number of cases associated with allergic reactions to the glue used to adhere extensions to existing lashes, the loss of natural eyelashes, conjunctivitis and even corneal damage due to tweezer injury,' Mr Arundel said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Repeated use of eyelash extensions can cause tractional alopecia, where the natural lash falls out due to excessive tension and weight placed on the hair shaft.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This can damage the hair follicle, which can slow down or cease any further production of natural lashes.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Arundel says that if women insist on the extensions, they should ensure that their beauty therapist has been trained in this procedure, that the equipment used has been sterilised and that the environment where the procedure will take place is clean.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They should ask their therapist what glue they will use and avoid places that only use formaldehyde-based adhesives as these are often linked to allergic reactions,' he added.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'If there is any discomfort after the procedure, any noticeable inflammation of the eyelid, grittiness, blurred vision or loss of the natural eyelashes, you should see your optometrist immediately.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4. TAKE CARE WITH NOVELTY CONTACT LENSES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A popular accessory on Halloween, novelty contact lenses are a popular beauty buy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But they can also cause serious damage to the surface of your eye. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Halloween can be a scary time for optometrists, for all the wrong reasons. Buying novelty lenses online or over the counter can lead to eye infections, damage, and even permanent blindness,' Mr Arundel said. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The surface of the eye is extremely delicate and wearing non-prescribed novelty contact lenses, particularly those from a dubious source, could cause eye damage ranging from mild infections to sight-threatening conditions such as corneal scarring and even blindness. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Contact lenses are not 'one size fits all'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It is important to make sure the lenses are prescribed by an optometrist who will measure each eye to properly fit the lenses and evaluate how the eye responds to contact lens wear using a microscope. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The optometrist will then instruct them on appropriate insertion and removal techniques and correct contact lens care to minimise the risk of irreversible eye damage.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5.

A part of my cause is to help others to see and experience nudity in a non-sexual aspect and within a non-judgmental environment.

She finished off her outfit with a long beaded necklace and a pair of black sunglasses, opting to keep her hair pulled back into a ponytail for the sunny day, during which temperatures reached highs of 72°F.

Creator Brian Yorkey has defended the scene, explaining 'it doesn’t even come close to the pain experienced by the people who actually go through these things.' Season one of the series faced similar criticisms over a graphic suicide scene, as well as the depiction of two female characters being raped.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Charlie Lankston</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-05-22T23:37:33.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>13 Reasons Why creator is slammed over anal rape scene</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-05-22T23:37:33.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5758323/Female-EasyJet-pilot-claps-male-passengers-sexist-comments.html" title="'If I'd known that YOU were the pilot, I wouldn't have got on': Female aviator details shocking sexist abuse she has suffered from male passengers"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5758535/Willow-Smith-17-reveals-shes-jealous-attention-curvier-girls-get.html" title="'Am I just not desirable?'
