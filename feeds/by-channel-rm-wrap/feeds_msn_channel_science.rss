But Kalief struggled with <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-22c1fb80-6992-11e8-8892-7d546f47b569">depression</a> and mental illness and just over two years later, on June 6, 2015, he took his own life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The night before his death, the 22-year-old Bronx native told his mother: ‘Ma, I just can’t take it anymore’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">His family’s ordeal continued when in October 2016, his mother – his greatest advocate and staunchest defender Venida Browder – died of a heart attack. Many claimed she died of a broken heart. She had spoken out publicly advocating for prison reform and even collaborated with rapper Jay Z and now-disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein to produce a documentary miniseries about her son titled, Time: The Kalief Browder Story.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Scroll down for video </strong></p><img id="i-a4ea38b15aed4f35" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/23/4CF25E2100000578-0-It_s_been_three_years_since_Kalief_Browder_took_his_own_life_aft-m-17_1528237243712.jpg" height="438" width="306" alt="It's been three years today since Kalief Browder (above) took his own life after being haunted by his ordeal at Rikers Island Prison where he had been held without trial for 33 months." class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-5088f64669297fb7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/23/4CEAD93500000578-0-image-a-18_1528237252631.jpg" height="438" width="306" alt="His brother, Akeem Browder (above) is leading the family's fight for criminal justice reform and wants to prevent others from experiencing what Kalief did" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-7ca05f616215ea35" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/4CEAD7B200000578-5810107-Kalief_was_arrested_in_2010_aged_16_when_he_was_accused_of_steal-a-1_1528290531544.jpg" height="664" width="634" alt="Kalief was arrested in 2010 aged 16 when he was accused of stealing a backpack with a camera, credit card, iPod Touch and $700 from another teen in the Bronx.

Then June 6th he committed suicide.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We as a family have three dates that we bearing every year and yet every year that has passed so far, we have elected officials that come to us who want to take photos and do stories with us as a family knowing they are up for re-election, but have not acted on criminal justice reform.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kalief was just 16 years old when he was arrested on May 15, 2010 after being accused of stealing a backpack with a camera, credit card, iPod Touch and $700 from another teen in the Bronx.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kalief told arresting officers that he did not ‘rob anyone’ and allowed them to search him.

At his arraignment, bail was set at $3,000. His family could not raise the amount and Kalief was sent to Rikers Island where he was imprisoned at the Robert N. Davoren Center (R.N.D.C.).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When his parents came up with money for his bail, it was denied, forcing Kalief to stay behind bars.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To try to protect himself from gang members and prison guards, Kalief tried to gain physical strength by doing push-ups and pull-ups inside his cell. But even becoming bigger in size could not protect him from being attacked, especially by prison guards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On September 23, 2012, the teen was filmed in handcuffs being brutally assaulted by guards and the footage was eventually leaked to the public following his death. Besides facing violence often, even more alarming is that Kalief spent nearly two years in solitary confinement, where he was still beaten by corrections officers when he was in the shower.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Part of the reason why his case never went to trial is due to the fact the assistant district attorney kept delaying it by deferring the criminal proceedings. In fact, it was deferred a total of 33 times until a judge released Kalief from Rikers on May 29, 2013, dismissing the case against him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Soon after his release, Kalief passed his G.E.D. exam and enrolled at the Bronx Community College (BCC) where he completed 11 credits and had a grade point average of 3.5. But due to depression, Kalief did not attend BCC in the fall and re-enrolled in the spring with hopes of finishing out the school year strong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kalief harbored intense feelings of paranoia and had anti-psychotics prescribed for him.

Akeem told DailyMail.com that his brother never struggled with mental illness prior to being arrested in 2010.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There was nothing wrong with him mentally or physically or emotionally, nothing before he left,’ he said. ‘When he left and came back, it was a 180, a total difference.

Located on a 400-acre island across from La Guardia Airport in the East River, as many as 10,000 people are held their daily. And about 85 per cent of the inmates have not been convicted of a crime and are either being held on bail or remanded to custody, according to date from the City of New York. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like Kalief, at least 1,500 people locked up at the over populated jail have waited more than a year for their criminal trials to begin.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Akeem revealed that he’s still upset that his family did not hear from New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo or even Mayor Bill de Blasio immediately after his brother’s death.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We don’t hear from Gov. Cuomo at all. De Blasio himself didn’t once come to my family and say I’m sorry to your family for your loss. And my mom before dying, only wanted for someone to take responsibility for doing this to her son,’ he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But yet in still we voted that guy, de Blasio in office again because either people were misdirected in their decision making and because they heard he’s shutting down Rikers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Meanwhile, he just sounds like he’s shutting it down and people are confused with the thought that isn’t this supposed to happen, yet we are still talking about it. There’s no movement.’</p><div>

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here is a short summary of the taxes you face when purchasing a property in the UK.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">1) PROPERTY TRANSFER TAXES</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Usually known as stamp duty (SDLT in England and Northern Ireland, LBTT in Scotland and LTT in Wales).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When a property is transferred from one person to another, stamp duty will be payable by the purchaser. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rate changes depending on whether it is freehold or leasehold, whether it is commercial or residential and what country it is in.</p><img id="i-dcc800f961ea249d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/04C69A91000007D0-5812499-image-a-48_1528291414630.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Stamp duty: When a property is transferred from one person to another, stamp duty will be payable" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rates of SDLT on residential properties range from 2 per cent to 15 per cent and can include a surcharge for second homes – this is often cited as one of the reasons for the decline in buy to let properties.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">2) INHERITANCE TAX</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The significant increase in property prices has brought many more owners into the inheritance tax net. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When a property is passed down, most typically following a death, Inheritance Tax is incurred. This will usually be payable on the second death (as most estates are left to the surviving spouse). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">George Osborne introduced an additional tax allowance for family homes when he was chancellor but this operates in a complex way and is not always available.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">3) VAT</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although VAT is not generally payable on purchases of residential property, home improvements are subject to VAT in the vast majority of cases. Major improvements such as loft extensions or adding on rooms will incur a significant VAT charge as the builder will have to add on 20 per cent to his costs.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">4) CAPITAL GAINS TAX</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Your main home is often exempt from capital gains tax, but second homes and holiday homes are not. For many years non-residents did not pay capital gains tax: this has changed and residential property gains are subject to this tax. The Government has announced that it plans to increase this tax to all types of UK property from 2019.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">5) ANNUAL TAX ON ENVELOPED DWELLINGS </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">For many years the UK was a very benign place for foreign investment in property and it was relatively simple for non-residents to legally avoid tax. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the ways this was achieved was to hold property via a company often registered outside the UK. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This has changed: residential properties valued at more than £500,000 and which are not owned by individuals, for example properties owned by companies (either UK resident or non-UK resident), can be charged ATED. </p><img id="i-65af6411274f6ed4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/0566C1B5000003E8-5812499-image-a-50_1528291579898.jpg" height="500" width="634" alt="Times change: For many years the UK was a very benign place for foreign investment in property and it was relatively simple for non-residents to legally avoid tax" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">ATED is charged at an annual amount at progressive rates determined by the property value. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are a number of exemptions for this, such as property rental businesses. Where an actual charge to the ATED arises, higher rates of capital gains tax can apply to gains arising on the disposal of the property.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">6) COUNCIL TAX/BUSINESS RATES</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Depending on where you live in the UK, your home is subject to council tax. Although the tax is used by local authorities to raise funds to meet the cost of local services in the area for which they have responsibility, it is nonetheless charged on the value of property. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the case of commercial property, this is implemented through a charge to business rates which is calculated by reference to the value of the property and a multiplier determined by the size of the business.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">All of the above taxes apply to properties which are owner occupied. If you receive rent for your property, there are additional taxes to consider.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">7) INCOME TAX</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you let your property you need to consider income tax, this applies to both residents and non-residents. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are a non-UK resident, individual or company renting in the UK, you are subject to UK income tax on the profits of your trade/property rental business. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The loan interest deduction rules for buy to let investors are changing - the effect will be that in some cases owners will pay tax on ‘income for tax purposes’ that is greater than their real income.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">8) CORPORATION TAX</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">UK resident companies are chargeable to UK corporation tax on the profits of their property trade/property rental business. </p><img id="i-af08a320732ce5b6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/4CF98D0B00000578-5812499-image-a-2_1528292064305.jpg" height="460" width="306" alt="Paul Falvey is a tax partner at accountancy and business advisory firm BDO LLP" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">This law is expected to change to include non-UK resident companies letting UK property from April 2020. Currently, non-UK companies pay income tax on their rent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Property ownership is highly taxed; this is not surprising given that property is easy to identify, difficult to hide and most often very valuable. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Property investors sometimes overlook the amount of tax they will pay over their lifetime (or sometimes beyond) of their ownership of property. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even your main home is not completely tax free as you will almost certainly have paid stamp duty, will incur VAT on home improvements and maintenance and your heirs could also pay inheritance tax.<span class="mol-style-italic"> </span></p><div class="moduleFull"></div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Paul Falvey, a tax partner at accountancy and business advisory firm BDO LLP, says most people who are looking to purchase a property are aware that they may have to pay stamp duty but, whether you’re buying your first house, a commercial property or a holiday home, there are many more taxes to consider.

</div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>MIKE DICKSON IN PARIS: Maria Sharapova’s return to the French Open ended in a crushing defeat when Garbine Muguruza emphatically silenced the shrieking Russian at Roland Garros. Wimbledon champion Muguruza took just 70 minutes to brush her aside 6-2, 6-1 and make the semi-finals at what is looking like one of the fortnights when she runs hot. Serena Williams might have fancied meeting this version of Sharapova, who made six double faults and 27 unforced errors. The Spaniard was awaiting the winner of Simona Halep and Angelique Kerber.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Matt Smith</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T14:57:39.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Garbine Muguruza beats Maria Sharapova to reach the French Open semis</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T14:57:39.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Maria Sharapova,French Open</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-5810029/Alexander-Zverev-laments-injury-issues-French-Open-quarter-final-loss.html" title="'How close was I to pulling out?

Others show a washroom that was once used by the workers, an office with empty bottles strewn across a desk and a flaking control room situated in the plant's basement.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Khaleda Rahman</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T14:17:42.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Haunting images show an abandoned coal power plant in Germany</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T14:17:42.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Germany</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5811693/Historic-Stack-Rock-Fort-island-sold-400-000-one-bed-London-flat.html" title="Buy your own ISLAND: Fort designed to defend Britain from Napoleon goes on sale for £400,000 (that's less than a one-bedroom flat in London!) "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5811699/Buckingham-Palace-shares-vintage-photograph-showing-garden-party-120-years-ago.html" title="Buckingham Palace shares vintage photograph revealing how its traditional summer garden parties looked 120 years ago"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/china/article-5810809/Mother-Nature-runs-wild-Chinas-emerald-isle.html" title="Abandoned by man, reclaimed by nature: Incredible images show China's eerie 'ghost village' completely swallowed up by plants after all residents in tiny town left to find work in cities"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.instagram.com/captured_entropy/" title="Hagen Grüttner (@captured_entropy) • Instagram photos and videos"></link></item><item><title>Fury of the Fonz! 118,000 Californians are omitted from voting rosters because of a printing error - including Happy Days actor Henry Winkler</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5812427/Henry-Winkler-118-000-Californians-omitted-voting-rosters.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 13:07:08 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5812427</guid><description><![CDATA[Winkler tweeted that he was one of the names left off polling registry on Tuesday.

Witness video captured the moment the 20-year-old mom was struck by officers as she was being taken into custody on the beach. The officers had questioned her about an unopened bottle of alcohol, but she passed two breathalyzer tests. They moved to arrest her when she refused to give her last name. On Monday, authorities said the two cops would not face charges over hitting Weinman. In her GMA interview, the young mom's lawyer said she wasn't hit with the most serious charges until the video came out and the officers came under fire.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ashley Collman</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T15:00:51.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Beachgoer beaten by cops speaks out as they are CLEARED of assault</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T15:00:51.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5811843/Judge-sentenced-Brock-Turner-recalled-California-goes-polls.html" title="Judge who sentenced Brock Turner to six months in jail for sexual assault loses his job in a victory for the #MeToo movement"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5809489/Pablo-Escobars-family-Colombias-Serna-charged-probe.html" title="Narcos family assets seized: Cocaine cartel leader Pablo Escobar's widow and son are charged with money laundering for Colombian drug dealer - and are stripped of $1million each"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5810241/Emotional-David-Spade-hugs-friend-street-Kates-death.html" title="'I don't think everyone knew how f****** funny she was': Grieving actor David Spade posts a sweet snap of sister-in-law Kate at one of his book signings "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5810997/Woman-trial-slaying-nephew-admitted-involved-years-long-secret-affair.html" title="Texas woman on trial for stabbing her nephew to death admits they were involved in a years-long secret affair"></link></item><item><title>'Knifeman' hands himself in and is arrested for attempted murder after his ex-partner and their one-year-old baby were seriously injured in stabbing</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5812407/Suspect-arrested-attempted-murder-ex-partner-baby.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 12:54:51 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5812407</guid><description><![CDATA[Rehan Khan, 25, was wanted in connection with the stabbing of 32-year-old Salma Sheikh and her 11-month-old baby in Feltham on Monday.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Nigel De Jong landing a kung-fu kick clean on Xabi Alonso's chest during the final is unlikely to be forgotten. But the Dutchman, speaking to FourFourTwo, protested his innocence eight years on and hopes a time will come where he and the Spaniard can laugh over it. 'I just wanted to play the ball – that was my only focus,' the 33-year-old said.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Nathan Salt</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T13:53:23.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Nigel De Jong reflects on Alonso kung-fu tackle during 2010 World Cup</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T13:53:23.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Spain Football,Netherlands Football</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-5812189/FREE-Giant-World-Cup-Wallchart-inside-Saturdays-Daily-Mail.html" title="FREE Giant World Cup Wallchart inside Saturday's Daily Mail"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5811615/Dele-Alli-captures-hilarious-moment-Raheem-Sterling-fails-catch-basketball.html" title="'Stick to football, Sterling': Dele Alli captures hilarious moment as his England pal Raheem is hit in the face by a basketball at the arcade"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5812077/England-train-ahead-final-World-Cup-warm-game-against-Costa-Rica.html" title="England train ahead of final World Cup warm-up game against Costa Rica as countdown to Russia continues"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5812061/Usain-Bolt-features-Stromsgodset-against-Norway-U19s-gets-ready-Soccer-Aid.html" title="Usain Bolt features for Stromsgodset against Norway U19s as sprint legend gets ready to play in Soccer Aid "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/de-jong-i-hope-have-a-beer-and-laugh-about-tackle-alonso-one-day" title="De Jong: I hope to have a beer and laugh about 'that' tackle with Alonso one day | FourFourTwo"></link></item><item><title>Lily Allen confirms her divorce from ex-husband Sam Cooper went through this week... two years after their split </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5812389/Lily-Allen-CONFIRMS-officially-divorced-ex-Sam-Cooper.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 12:50:19 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5812389</guid><description><![CDATA[Lily Allen has confirmed she is officially divorced from ex husband Sam Cooper, three years after their split.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="moduleFull"></div>

About a car.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ferrari is at pains to point out that this phenomenally high performance car with racing pedigree is designed to be as easy and fulfilling to drive on the road by ‘drivers of all types', whether race-track pros or high net-worth petrolheads.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And you will need deep pockets, of course. The price for a 488 Pista starts at £252,765 before you add any of the potentially very expensive extras. That includes £2,112 for the four-point harness, £8,640 for the go faster racing stripe, and £14,208 for the carbon-fibre wheels alone.</p><img id="i-d66f90f8950e0f73" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/13/4CF83C9500000578-5811977-image-a-10_1528286952349.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The new supercar’s Pista name means track and Ferrari claims it can be both a racer out there and civilised for the road" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new supercar’s Pista name may not translate so well into English from the Italian, but simply means track. When you arrive at the circuit you see above you in giant letters alongside a prancing horse on a Ferrari red banner the words Pista di Fiorano.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So what’s it actually like to drive? Pretty phenomenal, as you might expect. Especially for a self-confessed ‘ordinary driver' for whom it makes light work of piloting a supercar.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ferrari say the new 488 Pista builds and improves upon the earlier 488 GTB iteration and the previous 458 Speciale model, and is lighter, faster and more ‘extreme’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is powered by a mighty 4.0 litre (3,902cc) V8 engine developing 720 horsepower linked to a slick 7-speed dual clutch automatic gearbox with manual override, via paddles on the steering wheel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It accelerates at blistering speed from rest to 0-62mph in just 2.85 seconds – and up to 124mph in just 7.6 seconds – reaching a potential top speed of 211mph. The vitally powerful brakes will bring you to a complete stop from 62mph in 29.6 metres.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some comfort elements have been stripped out – such as the glovebox – in favour of open cubby holes.</p><img id="i-5c66ef233ac5336c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/4CF837C200000578-5811977-Aerodynamic_tweaks_mean_the_Ferrari_488_Pista_also_has_up_to_20_-a-1_1528291480452.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Aerodynamic tweaks mean the  Ferrari 488 Pista also has up to 20% more ‘downforce’ to help keep it rooted to the tarmac" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ferrari says the 488 Pista has the highest amount of transfer of racing tech to one of its roadgoing cars.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s 90kg lighter, about the weight of a man, than its predecessor 488 GTB, and has 50 more horsepower (and 115hp more than my driving companion’s 458 Speciale).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It also has 50 per cent more new parts in the improved engine and virtually no turbo-lag when you floor the throttle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aerodynamic tweaks mean the Pista also has up to 20 per cent more downforce to help keep it rooted to the tarmac. This is helped by a clever S-Duct used for the first time on a road-going car. It’s basically a gap behind the front bumper that forces air between the bumper and the bonnet and then over the front windscreen, boosting downforce over the front axle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are sharper gear-shifts and lashings of lightweight carbon-fibre in the functional racing-style interior.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It still had room for my hefty laptop bag in the under-the-bonnet ‘boot’.

Five are deaf, two have one eye, three are ex-fighting dogs, four suffer from defects and one has brain damage.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Katie French</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T14:32:46.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Husband leaves wife after she chooses her THIRTY rescue dogs over him</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T14:32:46.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5812075/Fashion-bosss-fury-white-middle-class-men-left-attacked-busy-Tube.html" title="Fashion chief executive who was attacked by 'unwell' 6ft London Tube passenger slams two 'white middle class' men after they walked into next carriage and left her to defend herself"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5812037/Robbers-break-Barcelona-home-Shakira-Gerard-Piqu.html" title="Robbers 'break into Barcelona home of Shakira and her World Cup-winning boyfriend Gerard Piqué while his parents are sleeping upstairs' "></link></item><item><title>How will £52m Brazilian star Fred fit in at Man United?

If he turns out to be a Kante, United fans will be pretty chuffed.</p><img id="i-3a2fafb9a1ab73ba" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/13/055ABF55000007D0-5812225-The_25_year_old_is_usually_deployed_as_a_central_midfielder_alth-a-131_1528286895448.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The 25-year-old is usually deployed as a central midfielder, although he has played deeper" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">And what about his weaknesses?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">He only stands 5ft 7in tall, so don't expect Fred to be winning too many headers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But he more than makes up for that in terms of tenacity - he was Shakhtar's most prolific tackler in the Champions League last season with an average of 2.9 per game (Kante's average was 3.3).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, United should be wary that this tenacity can sometimes spill over into ill-discipline. He received 14 yellow cards and one red in 29 games for the Ukrainian side last season.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The other concern is that while Fred has played 39 European matches for Shakhtar, the Ukrainian Premier League isn't exactly at the same standard of the Premier League.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">United fans may have to be patient while the Brazilian gets up to speed next season, especially as he'll probably be entering the campaign off the back of a lengthy run at the World Cup in Russia.</p><img id="i-1c75bfe8541041f8" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/11/4CE692FA00000578-5803181-Fred_is_very_quick_and_has_an_excellent_passing_range_while_his_-a-44_1528108919020.jpg" height="561" width="634" alt="Fred is very quick and has an excellent passing range, while his stamina is also impressive" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">How will he fit into a 4-3-3 system at United?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mourinho went with a 4-3-3 formation in a good number of United's matches last season and this would appear to be the best solution when it comes to accommodating both Fred and Paul Pogba in the midfield.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He would play either in the middle or on the right of the midfield three alongside Nemanja Matic, with Pogba stationed on the left.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some of Pogba's best performances for United have come from this left-sided station and potentially Fred could offer the answer when it comes to belatedly getting the best out of the Frenchman at United.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The key is in the link-up and transition between the deep-lying Matic and the rampaging Pogba, plus a forward line of Jesse Lingard, Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku further on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There should be a good balance about United's midfield with Fred aiding Matic in the defensive responsibilities when required and then springing Pogba.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The idea is that the speed of these transitions will give United the thrust going forward they have so often lacked under Mourinho.</p><img id="i-c1831b5df46cebcb" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/4CF9365A00000578-5812225-image-a-146_1528291316623.jpg" height="951" width="634" alt="How United could line up with Fred in a 4-3-3 formation next season" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-5202e229a1518863" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/13/4CEF84B400000578-5812225-image-a-143_1528287139806.jpg" height="453" width="634" alt="Jose Mourinho will hope Fred provides the link between defence and attack in his side" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">How will he fit into a 4-2-3-1 system at United?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">In certain games, Mourinho will revert to the tried and trusted 4-2-3-1, with Fred likely to sit in alongside Matic in defensive midfield.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This would be a more conservative role, with opportunities to break forward more limited, but Fred is certainly capable of the tactical discipline Mourinho would want with this set-up.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the chief criticisms of Pogba - and a reason why the youngster Scott McTominay was drafted in for big games last season - was that he lacked this discipline and would over-complicate things.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Problem is, it's now hard to see how they all could be accommodated in this formation and Pogba could well be seeing more of the United bench.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Reason being that United have so many decent attacking options Pogba wouldn't slot in.</p><img id="i-8b85526681cfe182" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/4CF9367200000578-5812225-image-a-147_1528291340505.jpg" height="951" width="634" alt="How United could line up in a 4-2-3-1 formation next season" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-99860dfd279f0b17" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/13/4CF124C800000578-5812225-image-a-132_1528286914622.jpg" height="948" width="634" alt="Fred gets a hug from his Brazilian team-mate Neymar during their training session on Tuesday" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Who is going to make way?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the 4-3-3, the man who looks like he has the most to lose is Ander Herrera. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Spaniard was drafted in to try to solve the Pogba conundrum but, though his passing is excellent, he struggles in the midfield battle.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fred has a far greater dynamism in this regard - he's also quicker, more skilful, more tenacious and more attack-minded - so you have to fear for Herrera.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mind you, given the sheer volume of matches United will have to get through domestically and in the Champions League next season, plus the inevitable injuries and suspensions, Herrera will no doubt still feature at times.</p><img id="i-ea75fe97768e8133" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/13/0550FB7E000007D0-5812225-image-a-145_1528287221435.jpg" height="441" width="634" alt="Ander Herrera reacts after United were beaten 1-0 by Chelsea in the FA Cup final last month" class="blkBorder img-share" /><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Is Fred the man to get the best out of Pogba?</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having spent two seasons trying to figure out the Pogba equation, Mourinho will certainly hope that is the case.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As explained, Fred should have the attributes to fit in as the link-man between Matic and Pogba, theoretically allowing the £89m man to forget defensive duties and concentrate on aiding United's attack.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It may take a few matches, a few months even, for Fred and Pogba to get used to playing alongside one another. They may well thread on each other's toes at first.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">What Mourinho should have here is the ideal man to bring the best out of Pogba in an attacking sense.

Canelo's Golden Boy promoter Oscar De La Hoya has announced the opening of negotiations for Daniel Jacobs to replace Golovkin in Las Vegas on September 15. That clears the way for a world middleweight title unification fight between Golovkin and Saunders, who had withdrawn injured from this month's defence of his WBO belt against Martin Murray. Golovkin, the WBC, WBA, IBF and IBO champion, has long coveted Saunders title, which would complete his set.

Villa were also paying £42,000 of Robert Snodgrass’ £60,000 during his season-long loan from West Ham.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Now, Villa must raise around £40m to avoid being found in breach of the Football League’s Financial Fair Play rules.</p><img id="i-4d8b97a6473c62af" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/11/4CF14E7300000578-5811893-image-a-106_1528281091205.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Villa offered huge wages - £60,000 a week to John Terry for example - with promotion in mind" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What was Tuesday’s fall-out all about?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Keith Wyness, the chief executive, was suspended on Tuesday after Villa failed to pay a late tax bill just shy of £5m to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As Sportsmail’s Laurie Whitwell told us, it is believed Villa had been given until last Friday to settle the overdue sum but missed the date and were threatened with a winding-up order.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Villa claim it will be resolved soon with an initial payment of £2m, but owner and chairman Tony Xia has been accused of failing to put cash into the club for three months.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Xia, who has no financial issues himself with an estimated fortune of £1billion, is said to have been struggling to get money out of China following a government clampdown.</p><img id="i-3320ac8145eaa371" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/11/4CF14DD300000578-5811893-image-a-107_1528281095346.jpg" height="439" width="634" alt="Keith Wyness, chief executive, was suspended on Tuesday after Villa failed to pay a late tax bill" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div>

<br />
</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Where is Xia and was it his call to suspend Wyness?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Xia has been in China since Villa’s play-off final defeat 10 days ago and he is said to have suspended Wyness after the two had a disagreement.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to some, Xia was unhappy with Wyness advising they settle their hefty tax bill owed to HMRC. There is no suggestion that Wyness has been accused of wrongdoing but Xia has now announced he will take over as chief executive until further notice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In an alternative version of events it has been claimed Wyness was attempting to bring together a consortium to buy the club without Xia's knowledge, who then found out and acted.</p><img id="i-e2b4e3681233c095" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/11/05292B83000003E8-5811893-image-m-110_1528281204901.jpg" height="512" width="634" alt="Owner Tony Xia suspended Wyness amid talk he was lining up an alternative takeover bid" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Is there a solution?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There could be. What happens next may depend on the valuations of Xia. There is understood to be interest from Peter B Freund, a shareholder in baseball’s New York Yankees, in buying Villa for £75m.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These days, that kind of cash signs you a striker for a top-four Premier League club. Will Xia accept that? The Chinese businessman is believed to have valued Villa at £100m initially.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, given the severity of their financial woes and issues with the HMRC, he could lower it. He may struggle to get a full £100m, given their threat of administration.</p><img id="i-5f738e2e43395db3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/11/4CF7CE1200000578-5811893-Peter_B_Freund_at_Arsenal_the_tycoon_is_reported_to_be_planning_-m-108_1528281136986.jpg" height="495" width="634" alt="Peter B Freund, shareholder in New York Yankees, is understood to be keen on buying Villa" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How does this have an influence on the actual team?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This has led to uncertainty over players’ futures. Terry, their captain of last season, is not set to re-sign when his one-year contract officially expires at the end of this month. West Ham’s Snodgrass is the same.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, we are already deep into the summer window and signings are no doubt down the list of priorities at Villa.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Plus, to find those £40m of savings to adhere to FFP regulations, Jack Grealish could be sold. Villa would want around £30m for him alone, as well as £10m for James Chester.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Villa are set for a reduced final year of parachute payments worth around £16m next season. That does not help you out a lot these days.</p><img id="i-df5a7b97abc8063d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/11/06A0F88A000003E8-5811893-image-a-111_1528281222436.jpg" height="376" width="634" alt="Tom Cairney's winner for Fulham at Wembley could prove extremely expensive for Villa" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>And the manager?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bruce has still not been told by the club that they want him to continue and is said to be considering his future. The now-suspended Wyness was among his allies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also, without investment, it is unlikely Bruce will be able to push for promotion with Villa again next season, particularly as he loses the influence of Terry and potentially Grealish.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He is believed to be open to staying but does Bruce have the backing of the board? No-one knows yet, not even him apparently.</p><img id="i-cb8536f854d55bd0" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/11/4C49D4B200000578-5811893-image-a-113_1528281280499.jpg" height="407" width="634" alt="Villa manager Steve Bruce is now in an uncertain position amid behind-the-scenes issues" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>And Xia has stayed silent throughout this?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He is something of a maverick on social media. His last update on Twitter came three days after the defeat by Fulham.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It read: ‘Still hurting. Felt even more when you realise how much all ppl love the club, gaffer, the whole squad, including myself, have given everything but still didn’t achieve our target. Also very difficult to verify ppl showing their real personality and humanity at this tough moment.’</p><img id="i-96e33b5a5df9c222" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/11/4CF14ED700000578-5811893-image-a-112_1528281271464.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Villa released a statement about Wyness, but there is no comment yet about a takeover" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What have the club said amid all this chaos?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Villa released a statement on Tuesday but only addressed the Wyness news, not whether they were looking for a buyer.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Aston Villa Football Club can confirm that chief executive, Keith Wyness, has been suspended by the club with immediate effect,’ it said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Owner and chairman, Dr Tony Xia will assume the role until further notice. There will be no further comment from the club at this time.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There will be a lot of work going on behind the scenes. Villa have found themselves pushed into a corner and have to fight hard to get out.</p><div>

Holding a mobile phone in one hand and a pint of beer in the other, one game-goer, identified as Gabby DiMarco by MLB.com, somehow managed to catch a high foul ball after the batter sliced a shot backwards from the plate. The ball landed in the women's pint, which remarkably remained in her hand.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Robert Summerscales</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T13:40:52.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Baseball fan catches ball in cup of beer - celebrates by downing it</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T13:40:52.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-5582743/Jason-Day-finds-beer-cup-instead-fairway-wild-shot-lands-fans-drink.html" title="Jason Day finds beer cup instead of fairway as wild shot on first hole leaves spectator with more than he bargained for in his beverage"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-5809921/Women-completely-absence-Forbes-100-earning-sports-stars-list.html" title="Women completely absent from top 100 top-earning sports stars list as Forbes shows the likes of Serena Williams falling off the charts"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sportsnews/article-5811463/Mexico-players-partied-24-hours-30-escorts-World-Cup.html" title="Mexico national team 'partied for 24 hours with 30 escorts' at private party just two weeks before the World Cup"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5809355/England-players-team-TV-host-James-Corden-comedy-sketch.html" title="England players to team up with TV host James Corden for comedy sketch in bid to win US support for World Cup"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.mlb.com/cut4/meet-gabby-dimarco-the-fan-who-caught-the-foul-ball-in-her-beer/c-279997458" title="Meet Gabby DiMarco the fan who caught the foul ball in her beer | MLB.com"></link></item><item><title>Homeowner finds a stranger's car parked on her driveway - then is shocked to learn the law is NOT on her side when she calls police to get it removed </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5811921/Homeowner-finds-strangers-car-parked-driveway.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 10:33:54 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5811921</guid><description><![CDATA[She was warned by Humberside Police not try to move the car unless she was 100 per cent sure it would not be damaged.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Frightened onlookers watch on as punches  are thrown during the melee in Birmingham city centre, with one man kicked in the head as he falls to the floor. The man who recorded the footage claimed that the fight was so chaotic that eight police officers did not intervene until the brawl was over. It was filmed by the passerby, who did not wish to be named, after he saw the violent fight unfolding outside Pit Stop Takeaway on Broad Street, Birmingham on Sunday. As the gang of men continue to hurl punches and hit another in the background, we see the bald injured male attempt to drag himself off the pavement and away from the brawl. The video cuts as a single policeman can be seen entering the scene.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Alex Robertson</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T15:09:07.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Mass drunken brawl breaks out 'while police stand and watch'</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T15:09:07.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Birmingham</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5811419/Widow-aged-100-neck-broken-brutal-mugging-dies.html" title="Widow, 100, left with a broken neck after mugger snatched her fake leather handbag with £1,000 for an electricity bill inside as she walked to church has died "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5811437/London-gangs-violent-ruthless-moving-capital.html" title="More violent, ruthless and organised than ever: London now has 250 gangs who use teenage drug mules to shift Class As across 'county lines' - as mobs forge alliances like 'McDonald's franchises' "></link></item></channel></rss>
