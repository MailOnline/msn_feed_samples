But its perilous position on the Norfolk coast, where other properties have been lost to erosion, put off potential buyers. Now, they have dramatically lowered the price.

At his arraignment, bail was set at $3,000. His family could not raise the amount and Kalief was sent to Rikers Island where he was imprisoned at the Robert N. Davoren Center (R.N.D.C.).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When his parents came up with money for his bail, it was denied, forcing Kalief to stay behind bars.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To try to protect himself from gang members and prison guards, Kalief tried to gain physical strength by doing push-ups and pull-ups inside his cell. But even becoming bigger in size could not protect him from being attacked, especially by prison guards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On September 23, 2012, the teen was filmed in handcuffs being brutally assaulted by guards and the footage was eventually leaked to the public following his death. Besides facing violence often, even more alarming is that Kalief spent nearly two years in solitary confinement, where he was still beaten by corrections officers when he was in the shower.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Part of the reason why his case never went to trial is due to the fact the assistant district attorney kept delaying it by deferring the criminal proceedings. In fact, it was deferred a total of 33 times until a judge released Kalief from Rikers on May 29, 2013, dismissing the case against him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Soon after his release, Kalief passed his G.E.D. exam and enrolled at the Bronx Community College (BCC) where he completed 11 credits and had a grade point average of 3.5. But due to depression, Kalief did not attend BCC in the fall and re-enrolled in the spring with hopes of finishing out the school year strong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kalief harbored intense feelings of paranoia and had anti-psychotics prescribed for him. He attempted suicide six months after his release from prison.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He also wanted to help support his mother so he worked for a period of time as a security guard, but was let go once the employer allegedly learned of his history with mental illness.  </p><img id="i-caf1479065721c08" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/22/4CF25E1A00000578-0-image-a-4_1528235731039.jpg" height="464" width="634" alt="Part of the reason why his case never went to trial is due to the fact the assistant district attorney kept delaying it by deferring the criminal proceedings.

Akeem told DailyMail.com that his brother never struggled with mental illness prior to being arrested in 2010.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There was nothing wrong with him mentally or physically or emotionally, nothing before he left,’ he said. ‘When he left and came back, it was a 180, a total difference. Besides in physicality, his mentality was totally messed up because of what he learned and experienced and was forced to do while he was there.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rikers Island Prison is notorious for being one of the worst facilities in the country. Located on a 400-acre island across from La Guardia Airport in the East River, as many as 10,000 people are held their daily. And about 85 per cent of the inmates have not been convicted of a crime and are either being held on bail or remanded to custody, according to date from the City of New York. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like Kalief, at least 1,500 people locked up at the over populated jail have waited more than a year for their criminal trials to begin.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Akeem revealed that he’s still upset that his family did not hear from New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo or even Mayor Bill de Blasio immediately after his brother’s death.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We don’t hear from Gov. Cuomo at all. De Blasio himself didn’t once come to my family and say I’m sorry to your family for your loss. And my mom before dying, only wanted for someone to take responsibility for doing this to her son,’ he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘But yet in still we voted that guy, de Blasio in office again because either people were misdirected in their decision making and because they heard he’s shutting down Rikers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Meanwhile, he just sounds like he’s shutting it down and people are confused with the thought that isn’t this supposed to happen, yet we are still talking about it. There’s no movement.’</p><div>

We are coming up with alternatives to fight incarceration and I want to empower the people to understand that.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Anyone can say they are for criminal justice reform, but if you don’t do anything to reform it you’re really not for it,’ said Akeem, who created <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.kaliefbrowderfoundation.com/">The Kalief Browder Foundation</a> in his brother’s memory.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Akeem, who traveled to the state Capitol on Wednesday, is calling for Democrat and Republican lawmakers to sign the pledge to end cash bail.

During his time inside the horror facility, he spent nearly two years in solitary confinement where at times he was starved. Kalief was also beaten by gang members, but also prison guards - the latter of which was caught on security footage (bottom right). He was released with no charges brought against him in 2013, but he struggled with depression and mental illness before taking his own life. His 35-year-old brother Akeem Browder (bottom left) had become a campaigner for criminal justice reform in light of Kalief’s imprisonment but has struggled to gain the support of New York’s politicians. Akeem wants to make his brother’s death mean something and today, three years on, he’s as determined as ever to realize that hope.

He then returned to the UK and moved to Cornwall, where his sister lived, for a fresh start.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He got a job in telesales, but it was then his addictions spiralled out of control and he slipped into 'heavy addiction'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: 'I was very reliant on cocaine to keep me up and alcohol to bring me down. That went on for about a four year period.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Pearce eventually found himself back in his hometown of Grimsby, sleeping on a friend's couch. By this point he was heavily addicted to both drink and drugs, and was eventually asked to leave.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He then decided to try and kill himself for a second time. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: 'On May 31 last year I threw myself off the cliff in to the sea at Cleethorpes.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But he survived and a passing dog walker pulled him out.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Einsatzgruppen were the Nazis' opening salvo in the Holocaust — SS units and police personnel who followed the regular army as it pushed into the Soviet Union in 1941, slaughtering perceived racial or political enemies in mass executions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Estimates vary, but experts agree they were responsible for more than a million killings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Nazis later established their system of death camps partially due to concerns about the psychological effects the up-close mass killings were having on the Einsatzgruppen troops.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The death camps and concentration camps … became the iconic images of the Holocaust, but it was the Einsatzgruppen that were maybe even a more stark manifestation of the Nazi ideology and the Final Solution,' Mr Zuroff said.</p><img id="i-5e69cd977510fc9e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/01/1412169572513_wps_36_The_June_3_1944_photo_pro.jpg" height="415" width="634" alt="The Einsatzgruppen - made up of primarily SS and police personnel - followed Nazi Germany's troops as they battled their way eastward in the early years of the war.

They pulled up to his car as it was stopped by the side of the road near to some traff­ic lights, which were green.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They smashed the window which clearly startled Michael as it would anyone — then he jumped out the passenger’s side and they followed him round.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The witness added: 'People who saw it were shocked too.

Knife crime has also led to the deaths of a 17-year-old boy in Ipswich and of 15-year-olds in Sheffield and Wolverhampton.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After an extraordinary day of violence, including the attack on Michael McIntyre, it emerged: </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">David Green, of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘A fall in police numbers combined with increasingly violent drug gangs has meant some parts of our cities resemble TV’s The Wire. Violent crime is rising and knife crime is rising as gangs fight over drug territories.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Experts believe a booming illicit drugs market – notably in crack cocaine – is fuelling much of the violence. They have also highlighted the middle-class appetite for regular cocaine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Metropolitan Police figures showed that crimes committed using mopeds, scooters and motorcycles soared by 50 per cent in the year to May, to 22,025.   </p><img id="i-77f75cef64d7f23f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/09/4CE8FBC100000578-5805219-As_the_thugs_fled_the_42_year_old_rushed_round_to_the_passenger_-a-32_1528186146174.jpg" height="880" width="962" alt="As the thugs fled, the 42-year-old rushed round to the passenger side of the vehicle to comfort his son (pictured), who is understood to have been in the car at the time of the attack" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr McIntyre, 42, who is worth £38million, was waiting outside a school in north<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="/news/london/index.html">London</a>, when he was robbed at around 2pm on Monday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Police are investigating whether the moped gang followed him from his £5.7million Hampstead mansion with the aim of grabbing his Rolex or if he was the victim of a random attack because he was driving a luxury car in a wealthy London suburb. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The father-of-two was picking up Oscar, 10, who with his brother Lucas, 13, are the source of a lot of his material in his much-loved stand-up routines. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Speaking after the incident, Mr McIntyre said: 'I can't really say what's happening, we're in the process of sorting this out.

The millionaire was called back to Parliament to clarify evidence he gave in February after an embarrassing Channel 4 documentary showed him bragging about 'dark arts' used to win elections for clients around the world.

It's a hard thing to say and even harder to face. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You will have to hear from others the little things that made me me: my perfume of choice is Michael Kors, my favourite meal is spaghetti bolognese, winter is my preferred season. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I wish I was a better cook. I'm a keeper of mementos – tiny hospital name tags, the poem Leigh wrote for my 21st birthday, first baby clothes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I know your Dad, and our village of family and friends, will keep me alive for you as much as they can, but there are some things I want you to hear from me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don't be afraid of expressing your emotions. I will never tire of hearing 'I love you' from Leigh, you boys, my family, friends.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Love hard.

Never fear failure – you will learn more from mistakes than successes. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There's never anything more certain than change so embrace it. Don't be afraid to try new things. Travel as much as possible – it will shape who you are.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Be brave in your convictions and believe in yourself. Never tease or ridicule someone because they're different to you. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You will be a better person by surrounding yourself with people who will challenge your views and beliefs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I can never emphasise enough the importance of good table manners. Remember to say please and thank you. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Address your friends' parents by Mrs, Ms or Mr unless told otherwise. Make your bed when you stay at other people's houses, and always offer to clear their table and do the dishes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You will have friends for a season, friends for a reason, friends for life. It won't take too long to work out which ones fall into which category.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Family comes first.

Next to her body, was a heartbreaking suicide note addressed to her 13-year-old daughter Frances 'Bea' Beatrix (together left), her only child, telling her she'd always loved her and not to feel guilty over her mother's death. The note read, according to TMZ : 'Bea - I have always loved you. This is not your fault. Ask Daddy!' Kate's husband Andy (with Spade right) was at the apartment when his wife took her own life according to police. The housekeeper who discovered Spade's body, who was found with a red scarf round her neck, reportedly ran downstairs to inform the building's superintendent who rushed back to the apartment, cut the scarf and attempted CPR.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Hannah Parry</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T14:09:25.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>The tragic suicide note Kate Spade left for her teen daughter</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T14:09:25.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>New York</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5809763/Kate-Spades-suicide-bears-sad-similarity-LWren-Scott.html" title="The tragic death of two fashion icons: How Kate Spade's suicide bears a sad similarity to the 2014 death of designer L'Wren Scott "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5808871/How-Kate-Spade-created-2-4billion-fashion-empire-lost-billions-cashing-early.html" title="Kate Spade dead at 55: How designer created a $2.4billion fashion empire with her husband but lost out on billions by cashing out early and spent her final years trying to launch a second brand which never matched up"></link></item><item><title>Texas woman on trial for stabbing her nephew to death admits they were involved in a years-long secret affair</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5810997/Woman-trial-slaying-nephew-admitted-involved-years-long-secret-affair.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 05:01:15 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5810997</guid><description><![CDATA[A Palestinian-American woman is on trial in Texas for allegedly stabbing to death her 25-year-old nephew with whom she was involved in a romantic relationship.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Nguyen died in a Jakarta hospital on May 19 following a cancer fight, said Ade Kusmanto, a spokesman for Indonesia's Directorate General of Corrections. The son of Vietnamese migrants from Brisbane, Nguyen was sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the infamous plot to smuggle drugs into Australia.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">As a drama student in 1969, I once got to help a professional company of actors. Inevitably, there was an after-show party and my friends and I were excited to be included in the social life of the grown-ups.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, what started out as a thrilling night of drinking and chatting to members of the cast took a very dark turn.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the party moved on to a cast member’s rented flat, I consumed far too much <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-b5599710-6914-11e8-a459-2f467bff1ce7">alcohol</a> for one unused to such volumes of the stuff.</p><img id="i-a4f11f89282f7876" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/23/4CF4277E00000578-0-image-a-1_1528238445317.jpg" height="670" width="634" alt="Jenni Murray as a drama student in the 1960s. She says she still remembers being raped with 'absolute clarity' " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Curling up in a corner, I didn’t notice the other partygoers drifting away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My awakening was rude. I was picked up, thrown down and raped. My cries of ‘No!’ were ignored and seemed to inflame my attacker further. He was huge and heavy and powerful.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As I sobbed, he punched and slapped me. When he rolled away afterwards, he simply said: ‘Off you go.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’ve never sobered up so fast in my life and couldn’t get out of there quickly enough.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nearly 50 years on, I remember that episode with absolute clarity. It was undoubtedly horrifying, humiliating and traumatic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the worst thing that’s ever happened to me? Probably not.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Losing my parents in my 50s at the same time as undergoing a mastectomy and chemotherapy as a result of breast cancer was infinitely worse. You really can’t get over those deeply painful and heartbreaking life events and forget about them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By admitting this, I find myself — in part, at least — agreeing with the ever-controversial feminist Germaine Greer. Last week she caused an explosion like a mushroom cloud with her comments about rape.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Speaking from personal experience at the Hay Literary Festival (when she was an 18-year-old student in Melbourne, Australia, a rugby player dragged her into her car and punched her in the face before raping her) she said rape wasn’t the worst thing that had ever happened to her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was determined to get over it. To not live the rest of her life as a damaged victim — or a ‘rapee’ — as she put it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She then went on to call for the lowering of punishment for rape and said society should not see it as a ‘spectacularly violent crime,’ but instead view it more as ‘lazy, careless and insensitive. Just bad sex’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, Ms Greer, who is not averse to publicity, could not have been unaware of the reaction she was likely to get from other feminists and the response to her pronouncements was visceral. How dare she, a revered feminist, trivialise such a terrible crime? How dare she let the sisterhood down in this way?</p><img id="i-a49082a1e58a11a1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/23/4CF427D900000578-0-image-m-5_1528239015630.jpg" height="803" width="634" alt="Like Germaine Greer, Murray has been determined not to let what happened to her dominate the rest of her life " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nevertheless, reflecting on my own personal, very similar experience, I had an understanding of what she meant when she said she had been able to get over her rape and get on with her life. Because I had been able to do the very same.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As dawn broke following my rape, I arrived back at my student house. I showered my attacker away, threw the clothes I’d been wearing in the bin, went to bed and slept.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I woke up with a humdinger of a hangover and a sense of absolute fury. I was angry with myself for making myself vulnerable. It was my fault, I thought, because I’d had so much to drink. It didn’t occur to me to make a complaint to the police. I don’t think I even realised that a crime had been committed. But, of course, it had.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I never told anyone at the time what had happened. I made jokes to friends about the bruises on my face, saying I had fallen over and bumped into doors in my drunken state.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I know now that this was the classic response of women who’ve been beaten. To this day, I’ve never named the rapist. He’s dead now, but I know he had a wife and children and I have never wanted to shame or upset them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But even then, in my youth and innocence and long before a woman’s right to enjoy a sex life was accepted, I told myself I had nothing to be ashamed of. I’d been silly to be so drunk, but what had happened was not my fault and it was, frankly, best forgotten. I hadn’t been a virgin. He was just another bloke.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just like Germaine, I thought to myself: You’ve been annoyed, not destroyed. Put it down to experience. Get on with life. Don’t be a victim. And never put yourself in such a weak position again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I like to think in doing so that I took some of the power from the man in question and reclaimed it for myself by refusing to let my life be dominated by his abusive behaviour.</p><img id="i-b7039ccc734bab81" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/23/4CF4279600000578-0-image-m-6_1528239171424.jpg" height="892" width="634" alt="Germaine suggested the sentence for the offence might be reduced to 200 hours’ community service and perhaps an ‘r’ tattoo on the rapist’s hand, arm or cheek" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">That said, it’s all very well for women like Germaine and me —tough, outspoken and open about the sexual experiences that we enjoyed in our youth — to look back on the one we did not consent to and say it was not the worst thing that happened to us. We were not badly hurt and we felt no need to let one 20-minute unpleasant experience ruin the rest of our rich and fulfilling lives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I differ from Germaine on the following point: Despite my own experience, I also believe that it is profoundly dangerous to diminish such a crime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For some victims, there is none of the violence we generally associate with rape — no beating around the head, no strangulation, no wielding of a knife and no fear of death.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nevertheless, the very act of penetration without consent is a violation, and that in itself is violence. I fully acknowledge that some women’s lives are destroyed by such an act. The virginity which they held as a precious commodity may have been taken, sexually transmitted infection may have been passed on and explanations to a husband or boyfriend may have been deeply traumatic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Worst of all, a pregnancy may have been the result.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rape is violation whether it’s perpetrated by a stranger, a husband, a friend or a colleague and whether there’s additional violence or not.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no shame in being destroyed by it. Not everyone finds it possible to move on from the experience and put it behind them. I put my rape behind me but I never forgot it. I suspect for both myself and Germaine Greer it has remained a powerful influence on the work we’ve done in sexual politics throughout our lives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, thankfully, so many advances have been achieved in the past 50 years in understanding sexual violence and changing the law to reflect the reality. I fully applaud all of them.</p><img id="i-cc34682b04735b25" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/00/4CF466FF00000578-5810197-image-a-14_1528241360222.jpg" height="507" width="634" alt="Jenni Murray pictured with her parents in Blackpool in 1951. Losing them in her 50s at the same time as undergoing a mastectomy and chemotherapy as a result of breast cancer was infinitely worse than being raped, she says " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let’s consider for a moment, that when a 19th century woman was raped, it was her father’s or her husband’s rights which had been violated. Now we understand that the crime was committed against a woman — not her male relatives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the early 20th century, any woman who appeared in court claiming rape was treated like a child. The judge was required to give the jury a corroboration warning, stating that women and children have a tendency to lie about sexual matters. This archaic warning was rightly removed —but not until the late 1990s.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was clearly unfair to suggest a victim may be lying and, of course, corroborating evidence is difficult to find when only two people know what happened. It’s her word against his. The alleged victim’s sexual history can now only be raised in England at the discretion of the judge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the Seventies, Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author of the groundbreaking Against Our Will, argued that rape was motivated by the need for domination and not by uncontrollable lust. She also laid to rest the idea that a woman wearing a short skirt was ‘asking for it’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, one positive consequence of the ‘MeToo’ and ‘TimesUp’ movements is that men have been left in no doubt that uninvited sexual activity is an abuse of power and can lead to serious consequences.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most encouragingly, young men now want to be part of the conversation with the new generation of young feminists, who are, thankfully, well able to stand up for themselves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This generation of young men want to know how to flirt, how to behave correctly in their relationships with women and how to ensure that the sex they engage in is good sex. They are open too to the idea of commitment and love.</p><img id="i-e850c417075ba92c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/23/4CF427D400000578-0-image-m-7_1528239196523.jpg" height="836" width="634" alt="'Yes, I was able to move on and enjoy my life but that doesn’t preclude me from wishing I’d seen the brute punished,' said Murray" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">None of this is to say there will no longer be rape — just that women are more protected by the law and the conventional mores of society than ever before. Something for which we should all feel grateful.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like Germaine, I was fortunate enough not to be badly hurt by my rapist and thankfully was not destroyed by him or made forever fearful of the opposite sex.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But this does not mean I expect the same response from all victims. Unlike Germaine, I fully understand that every woman reacts differently to being raped and those, like me, who recovered should not be considered stronger or superior to those who are broken by such assaults on them.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for a fitting punishment, Germaine suggested the sentence for the offence might be reduced to 200 hours’ community service and perhaps an ‘r’ tattoo on the rapist’s hand, arm or cheek.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is where I deviate from her view most vociferously. I would prefer the legal system take complaints seriously from the moment they are made, investigate them thoroughly and correctly and provide an atmosphere in court that’s carefully controlled by a well-informed judiciary. Then, if the jury convicts, a prison sentence should most definitely follow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Germaine claimed the legal system cannot cope because rape is so common and it always comes down to the difficult issue of consent, with the victims becoming little more than ‘bits of evidence’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Frankly, I would have been quite content to be a ‘bit of evidence’ if I’d had the guts to go to the police back in 1969. Yes, I was able to move on and enjoy my life but that doesn’t preclude me from wishing I’d seen the brute punished.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>As a drama student in 1969, Jenni Murray (right and inset) once got to help a professional company of actors but at an after-show party, what started out as a thrilling night of drinking and chatting took a very dark turn.
