Why shouldn't he be?' Gennifer Flowers asked Tuesday night during a Fox News Channel interview. Flowers was referring to the case of Juanita Broaddrick, a 75-year-old former nursing home administrator who told 'Dateline NBC' interview in 1999 that the then-Arkansas attorney general raped her in a Little Rock hotel room. She also made reference to Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey, two women who accused Clinton of sexual misconduct, while mocking the president for being 'a huge abuser of the #MeToo movement.' The feminist groundswell, Flowers said on 'The Ingraham Angle,' has largely ignored Clinton's accusers while it makes mincemeat of Hollywood's moguls and leading men.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>David Martosko</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T14:40:14.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Former Bill Clinton lover Gennifer Flowers wants him charged with RAPE</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T14:40:14.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5807897/Bill-Clinton-issues-non-apology-tries-clean-Monica-Lewinsky-mess.html" title="Bill Clinton issues ANOTHER non-apology as he tries to clean up Monica Lewinsky mess by saying he 'did apologize' to the whole world at staged Prayer Breakfast – and insists he's a #MeToo backer despite long trail of accusations"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5252487/Juanita-Broaddrick-slams-Oprah-Golden-Globes-speech.html" title="'Funny I've never heard you mention my name': Bill Clinton rape accuser Juanita Broaddrick slams Oprah for addressing #MeToo movement in Golden Globes speech "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5090399/Bill-Clinton-accused-sexual-assault-four-women.html" title="EXCLUSIVE: Bill Clinton is facing NEW accusations of sexual assault by four women while the former president was working with a billionaire playboy and flying on his private jet nicknamed Air F**k One, claims Clinton author"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4999202/Bill-Clinton-rape-accuser-slams-Monica-Lewinsky-MeToo.html" title="'Your silence was deafening': Woman who accused Bill Clinton of rape lashes out at Monica Lewinsky over her #MeToo tweet because she failed to speak up when she needed her"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/5794001521001/gennifer-flowers-levels-bombshell-allegation-against-clinton" title="Gennifer Flowers levels new allegation against Bill Clinton | On Air Videos | Fox News"></link></item><item><title>Roseanne Barr posts cryptic message promising to make 'restitution for the pain' she's caused after her TV show was canceled in the wake of her racist tweet scandal</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5812449/Roseanne-Barr-promises-make-restitution-pain-caused.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 13:19:28 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5812449</guid><description><![CDATA[After initially saying she was taking a break from Twitter, Roseanne Barr returned late Tuesday with a cryptic tweet promising to make 'restitution for the pain' she has caused after her racist tweet scandal.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Witness video captured the moment the 20-year-old mom was struck by officers as she was being taken into custody on the beach. The officers had questioned her about an unopened bottle of alcohol, but she passed two breathalyzer tests. They moved to arrest her when she refused to give her last name. On Monday, authorities said the two cops would not face charges over hitting Weinman. In her GMA interview, the young mom's lawyer said she wasn't hit with the most serious charges until the video came out and the officers came under fire.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ashley Collman</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T15:00:51.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Beachgoer beaten by cops speaks out as they are CLEARED of assault</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T15:00:51.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5811843/Judge-sentenced-Brock-Turner-recalled-California-goes-polls.html" title="Judge who sentenced Brock Turner to six months in jail for sexual assault loses his job in a victory for the #MeToo movement"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5809489/Pablo-Escobars-family-Colombias-Serna-charged-probe.html" title="Narcos family assets seized: Cocaine cartel leader Pablo Escobar's widow and son are charged with money laundering for Colombian drug dealer - and are stripped of $1million each"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5810241/Emotional-David-Spade-hugs-friend-street-Kates-death.html" title="'I don't think everyone knew how f****** funny she was': Grieving actor David Spade posts a sweet snap of sister-in-law Kate at one of his book signings "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5810997/Woman-trial-slaying-nephew-admitted-involved-years-long-secret-affair.html" title="Texas woman on trial for stabbing her nephew to death admits they were involved in a years-long secret affair"></link></item><item><title>'Knifeman' hands himself in and is arrested for attempted murder after his ex-partner and their one-year-old baby were seriously injured in stabbing</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5812407/Suspect-arrested-attempted-murder-ex-partner-baby.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 12:54:51 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5812407</guid><description><![CDATA[Rehan Khan, 25, was wanted in connection with the stabbing of 32-year-old Salma Sheikh and her 11-month-old baby in Feltham on Monday.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Israel has been ramping up the pressure for the agreement - which eased sanctions in return for Iran dropping its bid to develop nuclear weapons - to be ditched altogether after Donald Trump pulled out. But Mrs May told Mr Netanyahu in No10 this afternoon that the UK, France and Germany the UK still believe the deal is 'the best route to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon'. Protesters gathered outside Downing Street (pictured top and bottom right) to show their disapproval of Mr Netanyahu, after widespread criticism of Israel's brutal response to recent unrest in Gaza. Mrs May said the UK 'absolutely recognises' Israel's right to defend itself against 'extremists and terrorists' but was 'concerned' that more than 100 people had been killed.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>James Tapsfield</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T15:45:37.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>May braces for showdown talks with Netanyahu over Iran nuclear deal</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T15:45:37.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Theresa May,France,Iran,Germany,Israel</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5801915/Theresa-face-rebellion-Boris-Johnson-Heathrow.html" title="Theresa May could face rebellion from Boris Johnson over plans to order three-line whip over Heathrow third runway vote "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5801659/Days-Prime-ministers-staying-power-decade-over.html" title="Days of Prime ministers staying in power for more than a decade are over thanks to hourly news cycles says former Labour PM Gordon Brown "></link></item><item><title>'I want to get in your pants': The disgusting text messages a recently divorced male nurse sent to a drug addicted patient before paying her for sex EIGHT times</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5811327/Nurse-paid-patient-sex-tribunal-finds.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 08:58:01 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5811327</guid><description><![CDATA[Stephen Sullivan had sex with the patient about eight times early 2016 while he worked for NSW Health's opioid treatment program, the Civil and Administrative Tribunal found on Wednesday.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Can you imagine how terrified?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They probably targeted him because he had a child in his car, because as a parent you're not going to take anybody on, you're going to say, 'have whatever you want, don't hurt me or my child'',</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She added: 'Somebody please do something about these gangs' while fellow panelist Anna Richardson said father and son should seek counsellling and revealed she had needed help after she was robbed in a hotel room in 2016. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr McIntyre was in the Range Rover with his ten-year-old son  in the front passenger seat, one witness told the Mail.

I'm a keeper of mementos – tiny hospital name tags, the poem Leigh wrote for my 21st birthday, first baby clothes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I know your Dad, and our village of family and friends, will keep me alive for you as much as they can, but there are some things I want you to hear from me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Don't be afraid of expressing your emotions.

Never fear failure – you will learn more from mistakes than successes. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There's never anything more certain than change so embrace it. Don't be afraid to try new things. Travel as much as possible – it will shape who you are.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Be brave in your convictions and believe in yourself. Never tease or ridicule someone because they're different to you. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You will be a better person by surrounding yourself with people who will challenge your views and beliefs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I can never emphasise enough the importance of good table manners.

The blunder was spotted and shared by S**t Adelaide on Instagram with the caption: 'The Onkaparinga Council are looking for a suitable candidate who enjoys stimulating work, is able to easily grasp repetitive tasks... and is not afraid to get their hands dirty'.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Shri Rajen</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T10:26:41.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Shocking blunder in a job ad that has the internet in hysterics</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T10:26:41.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Facebook,Adelaide</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5631979/The-unbelievable-moment-Adelaide-woman-bites-waiter-served-half-fish.html" title="PICTURED: The gruesome injury suffered by a waiter after an enraged Asian woman 'bit his arm and put him in a HEADLOCK during a heated restaurant row over the price of a $48 fish'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5543607/Awkward-moment-half-naked-sunbaker-refuses-couple-exchange-vows-Adelaide.html" title="Awkward moment sunbaker refuses to give up her spot on the sand - spoiling an intimate beach wedding taking place just metres away "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.jobs4physios.com.au/job/hands-on-physiotherapist-required-southern-adelaide/41568664/?utm_campaign=joraau&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_source=joraau" title="Physiotherapist required Southern Adelaide Job Opening in Reynella, South Australia - Jobs4physios"></link></item><item><title>'If they don't want backpackers, so be it': Travellers hit back after poster in Far North Queensland town said they 'aren't welcome here' - and claim fruit-picking towns would collapse without them</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5810669/Backpackers-hit-racist-sign-emerges-Far-North-Queensland-town-Ayr.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 03:06:46 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5810669</guid><description><![CDATA[Furious backpackers in Australia have hit back after a racist poster was slapped across a shopfront in a Far North Queensland town.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Daily Mail Australia exclusively revealed Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, 34, was the third member of the notorious trafficking ring to die while serving jail time. Nguyen died in a Jakarta hospital on May 19 following a cancer fight, said Ade Kusmanto, a spokesman for Indonesia's Directorate General of Corrections. The son of Vietnamese migrants from Brisbane, Nguyen was sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the infamous plot to smuggle drugs into Australia. An inmate who served time alongside  Nguyen at Malang Prison, in East Java, said he was first hospitalised following an incident in 2017. 'He was sick a lot longer before then, it's just taking him a long time to get to the hospital because (he) wouldn't go,' the inmate said.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Daniel Piotrowski</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T10:58:55.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Diary entries of Bali Nine heroin smuggler after brutal executions</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T10:58:55.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Indonesia,Breaking News</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5806509/Bali-Nine-prisoner-Tan-Duc-Thanh-Nguyen-dies-prison.html" title="EXCLUSIVE: Bali Nine drug smuggler, 34, escapes the firing squad only to die of cancer in a squalid Indonesian prison - 13 years after he was jailed over heroin plot"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5665589/Convicted-Bali-Nine-drug-mule-Renae-Lawrence-performs-traditional-Balinese-dance.html" title="Bali Nine drug mule Renae Lawrence performs traditional Balinese dance in male costume while serving 20-year sentence for heroin smuggling"></link></item><item><title>Busted for doing NOTHING: Revellers will be banned from a six-hour rave if a police sniffer dog sits next to them... even if they DON'T have any drugs or contraband</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5810411/Police-ban-fans-entering-gig-sniffer-dog-sits-them.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 02:22:16 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5810411</guid><description><![CDATA[Fans may want to think twice before attending this Saturday's music concert 'Above and Beyond' after police said that music goers will be kicked out  if a drug sniffer dog merely sits next to them.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p class="mol-para-with-font">As a drama student in 1969, I once got to help a professional company of actors. Inevitably, there was an after-show party and my friends and I were excited to be included in the social life of the grown-ups.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But, what started out as a thrilling night of drinking and chatting to members of the cast took a very dark turn.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the party moved on to a cast member’s rented flat, I consumed far too much <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-b5599710-6914-11e8-a459-2f467bff1ce7">alcohol</a> for one unused to such volumes of the stuff.</p><img id="i-a4f11f89282f7876" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/23/4CF4277E00000578-0-image-a-1_1528238445317.jpg" height="670" width="634" alt="Jenni Murray as a drama student in the 1960s. She says she still remembers being raped with 'absolute clarity' " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Curling up in a corner, I didn’t notice the other partygoers drifting away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My awakening was rude. I was picked up, thrown down and raped. My cries of ‘No!’ were ignored and seemed to inflame my attacker further. He was huge and heavy and powerful.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As I sobbed, he punched and slapped me. When he rolled away afterwards, he simply said: ‘Off you go.’ </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’ve never sobered up so fast in my life and couldn’t get out of there quickly enough.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nearly 50 years on, I remember that episode with absolute clarity. It was undoubtedly horrifying, humiliating and traumatic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But the worst thing that’s ever happened to me? Probably not.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Losing my parents in my 50s at the same time as undergoing a mastectomy and chemotherapy as a result of breast cancer was infinitely worse. You really can’t get over those deeply painful and heartbreaking life events and forget about them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">By admitting this, I find myself — in part, at least — agreeing with the ever-controversial feminist Germaine Greer. Last week she caused an explosion like a mushroom cloud with her comments about rape.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Speaking from personal experience at the Hay Literary Festival (when she was an 18-year-old student in Melbourne, Australia, a rugby player dragged her into her car and punched her in the face before raping her) she said rape wasn’t the worst thing that had ever happened to her.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She was determined to get over it. To not live the rest of her life as a damaged victim — or a ‘rapee’ — as she put it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She then went on to call for the lowering of punishment for rape and said society should not see it as a ‘spectacularly violent crime,’ but instead view it more as ‘lazy, careless and insensitive. Just bad sex’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, Ms Greer, who is not averse to publicity, could not have been unaware of the reaction she was likely to get from other feminists and the response to her pronouncements was visceral. How dare she, a revered feminist, trivialise such a terrible crime? How dare she let the sisterhood down in this way?</p><img id="i-a49082a1e58a11a1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/23/4CF427D900000578-0-image-m-5_1528239015630.jpg" height="803" width="634" alt="Like Germaine Greer, Murray has been determined not to let what happened to her dominate the rest of her life " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nevertheless, reflecting on my own personal, very similar experience, I had an understanding of what she meant when she said she had been able to get over her rape and get on with her life. Because I had been able to do the very same.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As dawn broke following my rape, I arrived back at my student house. I showered my attacker away, threw the clothes I’d been wearing in the bin, went to bed and slept.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I woke up with a humdinger of a hangover and a sense of absolute fury. I was angry with myself for making myself vulnerable. It was my fault, I thought, because I’d had so much to drink. It didn’t occur to me to make a complaint to the police. I don’t think I even realised that a crime had been committed. But, of course, it had.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I never told anyone at the time what had happened. I made jokes to friends about the bruises on my face, saying I had fallen over and bumped into doors in my drunken state.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I know now that this was the classic response of women who’ve been beaten. To this day, I’ve never named the rapist. He’s dead now, but I know he had a wife and children and I have never wanted to shame or upset them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But even then, in my youth and innocence and long before a woman’s right to enjoy a sex life was accepted, I told myself I had nothing to be ashamed of. I’d been silly to be so drunk, but what had happened was not my fault and it was, frankly, best forgotten. I hadn’t been a virgin. He was just another bloke.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Just like Germaine, I thought to myself: You’ve been annoyed, not destroyed. Put it down to experience. Get on with life. Don’t be a victim. And never put yourself in such a weak position again.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I like to think in doing so that I took some of the power from the man in question and reclaimed it for myself by refusing to let my life be dominated by his abusive behaviour.</p><img id="i-b7039ccc734bab81" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/23/4CF4279600000578-0-image-m-6_1528239171424.jpg" height="892" width="634" alt="Germaine suggested the sentence for the offence might be reduced to 200 hours’ community service and perhaps an ‘r’ tattoo on the rapist’s hand, arm or cheek" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">That said, it’s all very well for women like Germaine and me —tough, outspoken and open about the sexual experiences that we enjoyed in our youth — to look back on the one we did not consent to and say it was not the worst thing that happened to us. We were not badly hurt and we felt no need to let one 20-minute unpleasant experience ruin the rest of our rich and fulfilling lives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But I differ from Germaine on the following point: Despite my own experience, I also believe that it is profoundly dangerous to diminish such a crime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For some victims, there is none of the violence we generally associate with rape — no beating around the head, no strangulation, no wielding of a knife and no fear of death.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nevertheless, the very act of penetration without consent is a violation, and that in itself is violence. I fully acknowledge that some women’s lives are destroyed by such an act. The virginity which they held as a precious commodity may have been taken, sexually transmitted infection may have been passed on and explanations to a husband or boyfriend may have been deeply traumatic.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Worst of all, a pregnancy may have been the result.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rape is violation whether it’s perpetrated by a stranger, a husband, a friend or a colleague and whether there’s additional violence or not.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is no shame in being destroyed by it. Not everyone finds it possible to move on from the experience and put it behind them. I put my rape behind me but I never forgot it. I suspect for both myself and Germaine Greer it has remained a powerful influence on the work we’ve done in sexual politics throughout our lives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, thankfully, so many advances have been achieved in the past 50 years in understanding sexual violence and changing the law to reflect the reality. I fully applaud all of them.</p><img id="i-cc34682b04735b25" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/00/4CF466FF00000578-5810197-image-a-14_1528241360222.jpg" height="507" width="634" alt="Jenni Murray pictured with her parents in Blackpool in 1951. Losing them in her 50s at the same time as undergoing a mastectomy and chemotherapy as a result of breast cancer was infinitely worse than being raped, she says " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Let’s consider for a moment, that when a 19th century woman was raped, it was her father’s or her husband’s rights which had been violated. Now we understand that the crime was committed against a woman — not her male relatives.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the early 20th century, any woman who appeared in court claiming rape was treated like a child. The judge was required to give the jury a corroboration warning, stating that women and children have a tendency to lie about sexual matters. This archaic warning was rightly removed —but not until the late 1990s.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was clearly unfair to suggest a victim may be lying and, of course, corroborating evidence is difficult to find when only two people know what happened. It’s her word against his. The alleged victim’s sexual history can now only be raised in England at the discretion of the judge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the Seventies, Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author of the groundbreaking Against Our Will, argued that rape was motivated by the need for domination and not by uncontrollable lust. She also laid to rest the idea that a woman wearing a short skirt was ‘asking for it’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And, one positive consequence of the ‘MeToo’ and ‘TimesUp’ movements is that men have been left in no doubt that uninvited sexual activity is an abuse of power and can lead to serious consequences.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most encouragingly, young men now want to be part of the conversation with the new generation of young feminists, who are, thankfully, well able to stand up for themselves.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This generation of young men want to know how to flirt, how to behave correctly in their relationships with women and how to ensure that the sex they engage in is good sex. They are open too to the idea of commitment and love.</p><img id="i-e850c417075ba92c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/23/4CF427D400000578-0-image-m-7_1528239196523.jpg" height="836" width="634" alt="'Yes, I was able to move on and enjoy my life but that doesn’t preclude me from wishing I’d seen the brute punished,' said Murray" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">None of this is to say there will no longer be rape — just that women are more protected by the law and the conventional mores of society than ever before. Something for which we should all feel grateful.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like Germaine, I was fortunate enough not to be badly hurt by my rapist and thankfully was not destroyed by him or made forever fearful of the opposite sex.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But this does not mean I expect the same response from all victims. Unlike Germaine, I fully understand that every woman reacts differently to being raped and those, like me, who recovered should not be considered stronger or superior to those who are broken by such assaults on them.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for a fitting punishment, Germaine suggested the sentence for the offence might be reduced to 200 hours’ community service and perhaps an ‘r’ tattoo on the rapist’s hand, arm or cheek.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is where I deviate from her view most vociferously. I would prefer the legal system take complaints seriously from the moment they are made, investigate them thoroughly and correctly and provide an atmosphere in court that’s carefully controlled by a well-informed judiciary. Then, if the jury convicts, a prison sentence should most definitely follow.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Germaine claimed the legal system cannot cope because rape is so common and it always comes down to the difficult issue of consent, with the victims becoming little more than ‘bits of evidence’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Frankly, I would have been quite content to be a ‘bit of evidence’ if I’d had the guts to go to the police back in 1969. Yes, I was able to move on and enjoy my life but that doesn’t preclude me from wishing I’d seen the brute punished.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>As a drama student in 1969, Jenni Murray (right and inset) once got to help a professional company of actors but at an after-show party, what started out as a thrilling night of drinking and chatting took a very dark turn.

And sources say Rodman, who has famously built a bizarre friendship with the dictator in recent years, will arrive in the country on June 11 and could even play a role in negotiations. 'No matter what you might think about his presence. One thing's for sure the ratings will be huge,' a source told the New York Post. 'A lot of times in situations that involve complex diplomacy countries like to identify ambassadors of goodwill and whether you agree with it or not Dennis Rodman fits the bill.' Darren Prince, Rodman's rep, said the basketball legend had 'talked about it' but had not made any travel plans to Singapore - although he said he was willing to go if the world leaders wanted his input.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Hannah Parry</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T04:48:00.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Dennis Rodman 'will be at meeting between Trump and Kim Jong un' </mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T04:48:00.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Kim Jong-un,Singapore,Donald Trump,NBA</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5805565/White-House-reveals-date-time-meeting-Trump-Kim.html" title="It's on!
