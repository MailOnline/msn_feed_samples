New Yorker Leah Melby Clinton, 32, said she walked down the aisle solo because her parents divorced when she was young, and she didn't want to hurt either of their feelings. Meanwhile, 33-year-old Abby Sherwood's parents didn't support her decision to marry her wife due to religious reasons, so she walked herself down the aisle. For Mallory Cooke, 31, who is from Tennessee, the decision to walk by herself was about keeping her late father's memory alive. At her wedding to Prince Harry, Meghan, 36, walked down the first half of the aisle by herself, before she was joined by Prince Charles.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Charlie Lankston</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T15:43:42.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Three brides reveal why they walked themselves down the aisle</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T15:43:42.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Meghan Markle</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5809569/Kensington-Palace-reveals-cards-sent-Harry-Meghans-wedding-Prince-Louis-birth.html" title="Kensington Palace shares a snap of the VERY cute cards sent to mark Harry and Meghan's wedding, Prince Louis' birth and Charlotte's birthday - and they've received 36,000 in the last month alone"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5808097/Danny-DeVito-poses-set-cardboard-cutout-high-schooler-Allison-Closs-took-prom.html" title="Returning the favor!

Weddings are supposed to be wonderfully positive occasions filled with love, romance and good cheer. Fat chance of that with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding, which has swiftly descended into an acrimonious, disorganised fiasco - and there are still three long days until the big day. Most of the blame for this falls on Meghan’s family, who’ve conspired to behave like a bunch of repulsive PR-crazed Kardashians, exploiting their girl’s royal romance for as much money and residual fame as they can squeeze out of it.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Katherine Thomson</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-05T16:49:07.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>PIERS: The Palace has let the Markles turn this wedding into a mess</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-05T16:49:07.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Meghan Markle,Prince Harry</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5735995/Meghan-Markles-nephew-says-family-hope-father-make-royal-wedding.html" title="Meghan Markle's nephew says family still hope her father can make royal wedding despite him saying he will undergo major heart surgery later today "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5734989/Meghan-Markles-half-sister-attacks-Harrys-bride-trying-censor-her.html" title="'She's NOT going to tell me I can't speak about my life': Meghan's half-sister faces backlash after launching an astonishing attack on royal bride-to-be"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5735777/Meghan-Markles-mother-touches-UK-emotional-reunion-daughter.html" title="A jet-lagged tea with the Queen?

She toured Europe, sang the blues and daringly performed frequently as a man, revealing that she was a woman at the end of the act by pulling off her top hat.

But dukedom can only be inherited by male children — not female — regardless of birth order. So if Harry and Meghan — who are rumored to want to start a family right away — welcome a boy as their first child, he will one day inherit his dad's title, Duke of Sussex. But if there first child is a girl, she will simply be called 'Lady'. In 2013, the Succession to the Crown Act changed the law regarding succession to the throne so it is based on birth order, regardless of gender. This means that William and Kate's daughter, Princess Charlotte, follows her older brother George in the line of succession to the throne, however that law applies to those in line for the crown, not members of the peerage.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Charlie Lankston</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-05T01:54:15.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Prince Harry &amp; Meghan's future daughter won't inherit a title</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-05T01:54:15.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Royals,Prince Harry,Meghan Markle</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5804919/Meghan-Markles-chef-ex-expecting-child-singer-girlfriend.html" title="Moving on!

This news comes just two days after it was revealed that Meghan's ex-husband Trevor Engelson asked for his girlfriend, dietitian Tracey Kurland, to marry him. Meghan was with Cory for almost two years but the laid-back restaurateur – who bears a striking resemblance to Harry – began to tire of her alleged 'prima donna-like behavior', a well-placed source told the Daily Mail.
