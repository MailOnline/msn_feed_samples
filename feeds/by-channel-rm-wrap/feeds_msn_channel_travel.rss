<p class="mol-para-with-font">Holidays usually give people the opportunity to relax, unwind and recharge their batteries.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But before they even arrive at their destination, scammers at airports can put a spanner in the works. And they can strike as they go through the departures security system.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To help tourists avoid being duped Palma Airport has produced a handy guide to the most common scams lurking at airports, from the 'queue staller' to the 'suitcase helper'.</p><div class="mol-page-break"><div class="pageBreak"> </div><div class="clear"> </div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The queue staller</strong></p><img id="i-934fb1615a97e4c5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/4CF9196500000578-5812463-image-m-35_1528290742539.jpg" height="1285" width="634" alt="An infographic showing how tourists travelling through airports can be scammed when travelling" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The queue to go through airport security is one of the most likely places where scammers will strike.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Their devious ploy is to work in pairs, with one person holding up the queue at the X-ray machine - and the other going through and taking belongings before the owner can get to them. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To ensure this doesn't happen, travellers should make sure they keep their eyes on the belt at all times.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They should watch for anyone loitering suspiciously and alert a guard if necessary.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The distractor</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In a similar move, thieves often try to distract travellers in a bid to get them to move away from their suitcases.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once this happens, an accomplice to the distractor will move in and make off with any unattended luggage that contains mobile phones or other important documents.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Security experts suggest never packing all of your valuables in one place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The 'free' wifi scam</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most airports offer free wifi so passengers can check up on their emails or social media.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But sometimes the networks aren't safe and have actually been set up by hackers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This means they can then access travellers' devices and steal personal information such as bank account details and account passwords.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The baggage carousel 'bump'</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The baggage carousel is another prime location that scammers target.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But as well as waiting for luggage, holidaymakers should also watch that they don't fall prey to the 'bump and run' scam.</p><img id="i-c736b2d7b1d8b206" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/4CF9196500000578-5812463-image-m-37_1528290790185.jpg" height="695" width="634" alt="The baggage carousel is a prime location that scammers target" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">This ploy is when a thief bumps into someone and quickly apologises - and steals a wallet or purse while the owner is distracted.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However frustrating passengers find the baggage carousel, and however tired or impatient they are feeling, they should make sure that their valuables are safely tucked away and that they are vigilant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They should also make sure they keep their eyes on the carousel to make sure no one makes off with their luggage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The suitcase 'helper'</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When travelling with heavy luggage a friendly person offering to help can seem like a welcome.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But often these 'helpful people' will refuse to give back passengers' luggage when they reach their airport transport unless they are given money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Experts say that the only people who should assist holidaymakers with luggage are official airport porters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The pickpocket</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With most tourists having their wallets, mobile phones and passports to hand, it is easy for pickpockets to strike.</p><img id="i-e50644d2e181216a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/4CF9196500000578-5812463-image-m-40_1528290859375.jpg" height="700" width="634" alt="Wallets, mobile phones and passports shoved into pockets make for tempting prizes for pickpockets" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once they have their baggage, they wander around looking for car rental desks, exit signs or somewhere to get a drink.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While distracted, pickpockets are waiting to grab valuables that have been shoved into pockets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Experts suggest fastening bags, not putting anything valuable in the pockets of suitcases and keeping anything of value inside jacket pockets or handbags.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The mobile phone scam</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As many travellers want to avoid roaming charges, renting a mobile phone in the country they are visiting may seem like a good idea.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Vendors will then say that they will give back any security deposit for the phone when it is returned.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, what some bogus vendors don't tell customers is that the devices have extortionate charges. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These vendors should be treated with caution and holidaymakers should steer clear of credit card payphones at all costs.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They don’t show any charges and can end up costing an absolute fortune.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The false greeter</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If passengers arrive at their destination and haven't booked a transfer but someone is waiting for them with a name card then they should beware.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This could be an elaborate scam cooked up by taxi drivers to drive them part way and then demand a hefty fee to take them any further.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Similarly if passengers do have transfers arranged, they should take care to make sure the person greeting them is genuine.</p><img id="i-287f47640037ee33" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/14/4CF9196500000578-5812463-image-m-42_1528290886834.jpg" height="1152" width="634" alt="When travelling from the airport to a destination by taxi, scam drivers may claim that their meter is broken" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile the imposter security officer is also something passengers need to be particularly aware of. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course, they may seem like a security officer but scammers can dress up and pretend to be officials who then demand travellers pay an on-the-spot fine in return for letting them go free.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The bluetooth sting</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Most people forget to turn off the bluetooth mode on their mobile phones, especially when they are relaxing on holiday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But when it is left on 'discoverable' airport hackers can easily pair with the device.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once they do this, they can steal information or even install a virus.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>The broken taxi meter</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When travelling from the airport to a destination by taxi, scam drivers may claim that their meter is broken.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This can be a ploy to overcharge someone.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To avoid this happening, travellers should agree on a price before they get into the car.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another common taxi scam is for the driver to take the 'scenic route'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While road design, traffic hold ups or road works can force a driver to take a longer-than-normal route, there are some occasions where a driver knows that some holidaymakers may not be aware if they are literally being taken for a ride.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A spokesman for Palma Airport said: 'Security at airports has tightened up a lot these days, and Palma de Mallorca PMI is no exception.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Of course, we are not trying to scare you and put you off travelling, as Palma de Mallorca PMI is one of the safest airports in the world, and its unlikely you will be scammed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'But saying that, when in a foreign country, it is always wise to have your wits about you and make sure that you are extra vigilant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Book everything yourself, keep an eye on your luggage and make sure you keep your valuables safe and everything should be just fine and you can then relax and enjoy your holiday.' </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>To help tourists avoid being duped on arrival Palma Airport has produced a

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Santa Monica sits just far enough away from the rush and concrete of Hollywood to offer a sedate escape, and maintains the glamour and excitement of neighbouring Beverly Hills.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yet when it comes to picking a location in sprawling Los Angeles, Santa Monica’s major draw is, unlike many other major US cities, that you don’t need a car to get around.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Car hire can end up being unfeasibly expensive in Los Angeles: parking is a premium commodity and you’ll often be expected to valet park at your hotel for up to $30 per day. Plus you can spend hours in traffic every single day.</p><img id="i-65886013f96b2315" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/10/4CF7E85E00000578-5798369-image-a-2_1528276510288.jpg" height="392" width="962" alt="Santa Monica sits just far enough away from the rush and concrete of Hollywood to offer a sedate escape.

Every aspect of an aircraft, including the materials, systems and overall design are checked and verified as part of the certification process. The latter is conducted by an external authority with the power to insist on changes, and if necessary to ground an aircraft. Not only is the design proven, but pilots, cabin crew and maintenance engineers are all trained and must pass rigorous checks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In describing the aircraft as a whole, there is a back-up for almost everything. The body of the aircraft, wings and flight controls make up the structure. The engines provide the power and propel the aircraft through the air and run all on-board systems - hydraulic, air, electrical and avionics systems.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These in turn make sure that aircraft can be flown safely from the flight deck, the engine gets enough fuel and the cabin stays at normal pressure and temperature. There are back-up systems for the landing gear and brakes, plus fire protection and emergency oxygen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Almost all on-board systems are duplicated on a modern aircraft, so that failure of any one system should not cause an aircraft accident.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the design basics is that there should be no 'single-point' failures. Such systems include the principle of 'redundancy' so that an aircraft remains controllable in the event of a system or component not working.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jet aircraft typically fly at between 32,000 and 38,000 feet (six and seven miles) high for most flights, where the engines are most efficient and there is less air resistance. The main body of an aircraft (fuselage) is a large cylindrical tube, which is the strongest and most efficient way to withstand the low air pressure at these altitudes. The materials used are well tested and structural failures are very rare. Those that do occur have been due to an error in operation or maintenance. </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ailerons make the aircraft turn and so without these, flight becomes more difficult.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, it is still possible to turn the aircraft using the rudder.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Air-conditioning (AC) pack</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Pressurisation is required so that passengers have air to breathe whilst the aircraft is flying at high altitude. For this reason all aircraft have two AC packs in case of failure. If one fails, the aircraft must descend just in case the other one were also to fail. Without any pressurisation, oxygen masks would drop and the aircraft would make an emergency descent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Hydraulic systems</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are normally three separate hydraulic systems on a large aircraft and these are the primary way to move the flight controls (rudder, elevator, ailerons and flaps etc). It is therefore essential that at least one hydraulic system is available, otherwise the aircraft cannot be controlled. As mentioned above, it has been shown that in exceptional cases, the engines can be used to steer the aircraft, but this has only worked in one or two cases.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Electrical systems</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are a number of separate electrical systems on the aircraft, each of which powers different systems. Again, the objective is to increase safety by making sure that essential systems will still operate if part of the electrical system fails. One action that might occur is that in-flight entertainment and other non-essential items might be switched off to conserve power.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Autopilot</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The autopilot helps the aircraft to fly automatically. There are still two pilots but they do not have to hold on to all the controls. There are normally two autopilot systems, because without  them the plane would need to be 'hand-flown'. Pilots are able to do this easily, but it is impractical for a long flight. It would also mean that certain complex approaches in bad weather may be prohibited.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Radios</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are at least two or three radio systems on the aircraft to enable communication with the ground, air traffic control etc. Special procedures exist for what to do if a plane loses the ability to communicate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Wheels and brakes</strong></p><img id="i-9a540bad4af8502c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/12/4CE64AEE00000578-5803149-A_LOT_767_made_a_safe_emergency_landing_in_Warsaw_after_the_land-a-33_1528111696817.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="A Lot 767 made a safe emergency landing in Warsaw after the landing gear failed to come down" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The aircraft landing gear is designed to support the weight of the aircraft when landing and provide braking.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As well as wheel brakes, aircraft also have 'reverse thrust' from the engines to slow the aircraft when it lands.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From time to time, landing gear failures do occur, either partially or completely. It is not possible to have a back-up for the undercarriage wheels. However, there have been some remarkable examples of the pilot and aircraft coping with unusual events.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In one extreme case, an aircraft landed with no landing gear at all. This happened to a Lot 767 at Warsaw in 2011, where the landing gear did not come down due to a hydraulic leak. After flying around and trying to find the problem, a landing was attempted and the aircraft effectively skidded to a halt on the runway. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There were no injuries during the emergency. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the case of Tam A332 at New York in September 2012, the nose gear can be seen to be at 90 degrees to the direction of flight, during the first attempt to land. On the final approach, and just before landing, the nose gear straightened just before the aircraft touched down.</p><img id="i-2a9c641729859151" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/12/4CE64AF300000578-5803149-A_TAM_A332_at_New_York_in_September_2012_made_one_approach_with_-a-32_1528111696790.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="A Tam A332 at New York in September 2012 made one approach with the nose gear at 90 degrees to the direction of flight" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In 2005, a Jet Blue Airbus A320 landed at Los Angeles, California, with the nose gear at 90 degrees. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite generating a shower of sparks, as the rubber was worn away, the aircraft made a controlled landing with no fire and no injuries on board.<strong> </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic">Dr Simon Place is a Senior Lecturer at the </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/Centres/Safety-and-Accident-Investigation-Centre"><span class="mol-style-italic">Safety and Accident Investigation Centre, Cranfield University</span></a><span class="mol-style-italic">.

And Shane’s Castle, on the shores of Lough Neagh, was where the Hand’s Tourney was staged.</p><img id="i-a4f4769d20344258" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/15/4CD65B3200000578-0-image-a-55_1527949208088.jpg" height="460" width="306" alt="Bran and Jon (above) in the hit TV show" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Even if you are not glued to the many plot twists and turns, the trail will still be an adventure. I sped through the area of Castle Ward that doubles as the Whispering Wood before finding myself alongside the lough.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After my day at Winterfell came to an end, I travelled to the nearby village of Strangford to rest for the evening. The local bed-and-breakfast, The Cuan, hosted many of the actors from the show during filming, including Sean Bean and Maisie Williams.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The hotel’s restaurant has even been transformed into a hall for feasting, with family banners adorning the walls. The dishes all come from George R. R. Martin’s novels and include cod cakes, honey-roasted chicken in roasted onions, and direwolf butter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Northern Ireland has a tumultuous past, but with HBO bringing one of the world’s most popular TV series to its shores, there is no shortage of visitors wanting to follow in the footsteps of Jon Snow.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-b1a84c80-666f-11e8-a205-79ac6aaea0fa">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TRAVEL FACTS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Winterfell Tours (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://gameofthrones-winterfelltours.com/" title="This link is invalid, and will be stripped on publish"></a><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://gameofthrones-winterfelltours.com/">gameofthrones-winterfelltours.com</a>) offers tours to Castle Ward and other key locations from £29 per person.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Continuing our series featuring the holiday memories of famous people, this week actress Amanda Redman, 60, recalls her lifetime of adventures.</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My first holiday </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I remember going to Tintagel in North Cornwall with my family when I was about seven. We drove there from Brighton, which took for ever. The area is so steeped in myths and I was fascinated by all the Arthurian legends. We visited Merlin’s Cave and I had a Cornish cream tea for the first time. I still adore them now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>First time abroad </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We went to South Africa when I was 11. My dad Ron worked for publishers Hutchinson and he had to man the Johannesburg office for six months. It seemed so exotic seeing local women carrying baskets of fruits on their head. I went to school there and adapted quickly.</p><img id="i-b18c84f411d443a5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/14/4CD65B3A00000578-0-image-a-29_1527947835189.jpg" height="422" width="634" alt="Soulmates: Amanda and Damien (above) on their wedding day in 2010" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I remember being given biltong, a dry cured meat, and hating it. But I loved drinking root beer which I thought was alcoholic. And going to the drive-in hamburger joints was so exciting. It was just like being in the movies.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Most memorable school trip </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We took a cruise to Moscow, Finland and Denmark when I was 16. It was in the 1970s and we were visiting these extraordinary places. It seems incredible now.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I remember buying vodka in Moscow, secreting it back on to the ship, and getting drunk in our cabin. I attended an all-girls’ grammar school but all the local state schools were on the trip too so there were boys on board. Of course there were shenanigans. Where there’s a will…</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My honeymoon</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My husband Damian and I headed to a beautiful private tropical island called Benguerra in the Indian Ocean in 2010. To reach the island, we flew by helicopter from Mozambique. Benguerra is the second-largest island in the Bazaruto archipelago and has white-sand beaches and turquoise sea. We had our own plunge pool and a butler and it was Margherita Time every day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am an all-or-nothing person. I work really hard, but when I relax, I can lie on a sunlounger for an entire day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My holiday nightmare</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I split up with my then-boyfriend during a trip to Morocco. We then had to stay together until we returned to Britain a week later because we were in the middle of nowhere. To say it was strained is an understatement – it was utterly horrific.</p><img id="i-f8569af5369c6601" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/14/4CD65B3E00000578-0-image-a-30_1527947906760.jpg" height="429" width="634" alt="Family time: A young Amanda with her mother, Joan (above)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My best break</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Damian and I went to Zanzibar in 1999, our first holiday together. It cemented our relationship and made me realise that he was my soulmate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was also one of the most magical places I’ve ever been to. It was so romantic that I sobbed when I got there and couldn’t stop crying. I had never seen a place so lovely in my life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The stars were unlike anything else I’ve ever seen, and as Damian is interested in astronomy, in the evenings we would lie on our balcony for hours just gazing up at the night sky and he’d explain everything to me.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Dream destination</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bora Bora. I’d love to go to the French Polynesian Islands. The beaches and the people look so stunningly beautiful. Anything to do with the South Pacific islands intrigues me because they are so far away. I loved the movie Mutiny On The Bounty and the book Moby Dick is a favourite too.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My husband has been there and every time it is suggested, he says I wouldn’t like it and I’d be disappointed by all the American chain hotels. But I will insist we go one day.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The TV star remembers getting drunk on a cruise during a school trip, plus her dream honeymoon to a private island in the Indian Ocean.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">As the sun sets, a campervan is parked on an empty beach. A happy family sit around a blazing fire with no one else in sight. Since it was born at the height of the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-66e27930-665d-11e8-a205-79ac6aaea0fa">California</a> flowerpower era, that seductive fantasy has remained a bucketlist aspiration for many of us. It looks so easy – but the 21st Century reality of the hippy holiday dream takes a little more thought.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My first campervan trip ended with me sleeping in a borrowed tent because the kids hated sleeping in the ‘roof’ beds. So make sure you pick the right motorhome. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A modern vehicle may not have the appeal of the VW original but it can be a lot more comfortable. And rather than a beautiful empty beach, you could end up in a noisy campsite miles from the sea. So here are ten tips to help you avoid the pitfalls…</p><img id="i-d78003f6955b11b6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/12/4CD7307500000578-0-Plan_your_meals_and_buy_food_in_advance_says_The_Mail_on_Sunday_-a-18_1527940732669.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Plan your meals and buy food in advance, says The Mail on Sunday's Simon Heptinstall" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1. KEEP IT SIMPLE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’re new to motorhoming, try a simple campervan experience first. Hire a vehicle for a weekend and drive to the nearest National Park or seaside. Even then you’ll need to research where you can park for the night – you can’t just stop anywhere you fancy. Campsites offer facilities but may not fit your wild camping fantasy. Sites such as park4night.com have lots of suggestions for more edgy overnight spots.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. BOOK YOUR HOME EARLY</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before you make too many plans, make sure you can get your campervan – there is a limited range available, so do book early. You can find all sorts of motorhomes at the dedicated comparison site cheapmotorhomes.co.uk . For a classic VW Camper, try camperbug.co.uk .</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. TAKE THINGS SLOWLY</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any sort of motorhome will be slower and more unwieldy to drive than you are used to. American- style motorhomes need special care – they can be a couple of feet wider than a car. The first time I tried to park a campervan, I crashed it into my own car.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4. DON’T FORGET ESSENTIALS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Check what is included with the hire vehicle and make a list of what you need to bring. Don’t spend a bank holiday looking for a shop that sells tin-openers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5. ENJOY THE FREEDOM</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You may plan a route, but once you’re out there, there’s no need to stick to any schedule. It takes a bit of getting used to amid our finely timetabled lives, but the whole point of the campervan dream is that you can stop for an extra day to enjoy anything you stumble upon – or simply drive off to discover something new. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>6. GO WITH PEOPLE YOU LIKE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You’ll be stuck next to the other passengers for days, so if you must invite friends, make sure they’re good ones.</p><img id="i-b211ad902b769357" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/12/4CD65B1600000578-0-Freedom_A_vintage_campervan_parked_up_on_an_empty_pebbled_beach_-a-19_1527940749151.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Freedom: A vintage campervan parked up on an empty pebbled beach (above)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>7. PLAN YOUR MEALS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unless your holiday dream involves non-stop takeaways, plan meals and buy food in advance. Think about things that you can cook in cramped circumstances, and remember storage might be limited.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>8. PREPARE TO EXTEND</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My own first motorhome experience showed I needed more space immediately. So awnings and tents are a great idea.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>9. AVOID MESS STRESS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The secret of staying in a confined space is to keep everything in its place. Don’t spend the holiday looking for matches or socks: regularly putting things away will save hours of can’t-find-it angst later.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>10. STAY WARM</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the campervan fantasy, everyone wore shorts – but in the UK that might not do. Be sure to bring warm clothes and lots of blankets to use at night.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Here's The Mail on Sunday's Simon Heptinstall's top ten tips to help you avoid the pitfalls when planning a camping holiday.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>Mail on Sunday</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Samantha Lewis</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-02T22:01:46.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Check out our top ten camping tips</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-02T22:01:46.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-5797921/An-Inspector-Calls-Royal-Oak-Wiltshire-homely-pork-crackling-perfect.html" title="An Inspector Calls...

He investigates BA's recently launched 'Basic' fares and Virgin's new 'Economy Light' tickets.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Flights to many long-haul destinations with <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/british_airways/index.html" id="mol-3883c120-666c-11e8-a205-79ac6aaea0fa">British Airways</a> and Virgin are now available at significantly lower fares. The airlines have introduced tickets that exclude checked-in bags – on most routes, return fares are £60 cheaper than standard economy.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With BA, these lower Basic fares are initially on offer on flights to Austin, Boston, Denver, Oakland and Philadelphia in the US; and the Dominican Republic, Dubai, Delhi, Hong Kong and <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/singapore/index.html" id="mol-388520b0-666c-11e8-a205-79ac6aaea0fa">Singapore</a>. Key destinations with Virgin’s new Economy Light fares include New York, Los Angeles and Hong Kong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Travelling further afield often means you’ll be away longer so you’ll need more than just a carry-on bag. But one person in your party could travel with hand luggage on the cheaper fare, while another could check in a bag.</p><img id="i-99792e6dcb7e5ef9" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/15/4CD65B2A00000578-5798331-The_mile_high_city_BA_now_offers_cheaper_flights_to_Denver_and_o-m-1_1527948715937.jpg" height="452" width="634" alt="The mile high city: BA now offers cheaper flights to Denver and other cities in the United States" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">That said, if choosing different fare types, annoyingly you need to make separate bookings – once done, ask the airline to link them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The other key thing to note with these new, reduced fares is seat selection. Under BA’s Basic fare, seats are allocated by the airline (unless you’re an Executive Club member). With Virgin’s Economy Light fare, you can select a seat at check-in (online from 24 hours before departure). By then, options may be limited.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">BA and Virgin have started offering these pared-down fares to compete with rivals such as Norwegian. Other low-cost players include Icelandic airline WOW Air (all of its transatlantic flights go via Reykjavik), and newcomer Primera Air, which has started selling flights from Stansted and Birmingham to some US and Canadian cities.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So shop around. As well as comparing headline prices, check carefully what’s included in airlines’ cheapest fares. As the chart above shows, there are big differences. For example, BA’s hand-baggage allowance is the most generous, and BA and Virgin fares include meals and drinks, unlike the other airlines. Note too that not all offer in-flight entertainment.</p><img id="i-cd7576b1e2270584" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/14/4CD78F2700000578-0-image-a-21_1527947414332.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="BA and Virgin have started offering lower fares to compete with rivals such as Norwegian" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">So while BA and Virgin may not be the cheapest – as the sample fares to Boston show – you may still think they are preferable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finally, consider charter airlines for affordable long-haul flights. I flew to New York last summer with Thomas Cook Airlines from Manchester, as it offered the cheapest flights on the dates I wanted. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The airline has seven US destinations this summer, including a new Seattle service from Manchester.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The Mail on Sunday's Fred Mawer offers advice to frugal long-haul flyers.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Everything about the tiny Swedish village of Fjallbacka screams holiday perfection. From my vantage point next to the church, I look down towards the harbour and a cluster of red-roofed, weather-boarded houses, set against clear blue skies and granite cliffs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Fjallbacka (population: 987) has seen more than 80 fictional murders take place within its confines, thanks to the works of Camilla Lackberg, the bestselling author who grew up here.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Do you see that diving board?’ asks Asa Cunniff, a nice Swedish woman who recently returned to the area after several decades living in Maidenhead. I look down to where the sun glistens on the water and see a jetty. ‘In The Drowning, a body was found hanging from it,’ she says matter-of-factly.</p><img id="i-a775d098d3420ec" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/13/4CD7441300000578-5798107-image-a-2_1527941648431.jpg" height="158" width="634" alt="Holiday perfection: The pretty harbour (above) in the tiny fishing village of Fjallbacka" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Close to the border with Norway and a 90-minute drive from Gothenburg, Fjallbacka has some of the country’s most spectacular scenery (which is saying something) and is a hugely popular holiday destination for Swedes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ingrid Bergman loved it here too – she spent every summer on the nearby island of Dannholmen. There’s a small tribute to her by the harbour. Asa points out a photograph of a boy receiving a prize from Bergman for a sailing regatta. ‘That’s Ingemar. He now runs boat trips,’ she adds.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fortunately, away from Lackberg’s Nordic noir novels, the only screams in summer are of children by the waterfront angling for ice creams and excited Lackberg fans spotting the locations for murders.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Asa has seen a huge increase in demand for her tours, particularly among Britons. She points out the waterside cottage that Lackberg still owns and visits regularly.</p><img id="i-1d10bd9f25e2e5" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/14/4CD7442500000578-5798107-Black_gold_Per_and_Lars_on_one_of_their_lobster_fishing_trips-a-3_1527944830292.jpg" height="845" width="634" alt="Black gold: Per and Lars on one of their lobster fishing trips" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-406d59d2a89b637a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/13/4CD7442900000578-5798107-image-a-4_1527941664749.jpg" height="418" width="306" alt="Bestselling author Camilla Lackberg (above)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">As summer ends, the lobster season gets under way. Fishermen in the nearby village of Grebbestad run crustacean safaris. We set sail under cloudless skies with brothers Per and Lars. In these parts, lobsters are known as ‘black gold’ and each one sells for about £40 a kilo.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They are highly prized since the cold water means that they grow slowly and have exceptional flavour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since this is an orderly society, every lobster is measured and the small ones and the pregnant ones (where eggs can be seen) are put back in the water. And since this is a civilised safari, we have fika – coffee and biscuits – during a break.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another passenger brings out some schnapps and I feel myself becoming more Nordic by the minute. At the end, ten lobsters have been hauled in along with more than 20 crabs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back at Fjallbacka, I go for a walk along the Jungsklyftan, a dramatic gorge that towers over the village. The Preacher, Lackberg’s second novel set in the village, starts with a small boy coming across a woman there he assumes is sleeping.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My hotel, the Stora Hotellet Bryggan, also features regularly in Lackberg’s novels.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A keen cook, the author has even collaborated with the restaurant on the menu. Today, there are just a few other tables occupied as I watch the sun set over the water and I eat my lobster with a huge sense of contentment.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-1ba4cf10-6651-11e8-988a-990f84e5c10c">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TRAVEL FACTS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Norwegian (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://norwegian.com/">norwegian.com</a>) offers return flights from Gatwick to Gothenburg from £70.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rooms at the Stora Hotellet Bryggan (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://storahotelletbryggan.se/" title="This link is invalid, and will be stripped on publish"></a><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://storahotelletbryggan.se/">storahotelletbryggan.se</a>) cost from £120 per night B&amp;B.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For more information on West Sweden visit <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://westsweden.com/">westsweden.com</a>, and for Sweden in general go to <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://visitsweden.com/">visitsweden.com</a>.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Glamorous camping, or glamping, is all the rage. Such holidays promise all the excitement and adventure of sleeping in the great outdoors without the discomfort of bedding down under damp canvas with only a bucket for a bathroom.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Jonathan Knight, founder of new website glampingly.co.uk, says the popularity of such breaks has rocketed partly because there has been a much greater appreciation of the outdoors over the past decade – perhaps as a reaction to all the technology around us. ‘Glamping is also easier and more comfortable than regular camping and appeals to more people,’ he says. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘There’s no need to own or store camping gear, so even city-dwellers can enjoy the lifestyle perks of camping – the fires, the sunsets, the countryside. That makes glamping perfect for shorter breaks, too – you turn up and relax from the minute you arrive.’</p><img id="i-c3b54163844a089a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/13/4CD7663700000578-5797997-image-a-2_1527943812338.jpg" height="560" width="962" alt="Jonathan Knight, founder of new website glampingly.co.uk, says the popularity of glamping breaks has rocketed partly because there has been a much greater appreciation of the outdoors over the past decade (file image)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Greater demand has resulted in the creation of many more glamping venues all over the country, many in fantastically picturesque, away-from-it-all locations. More competition has led to greater innovation, too, so you can stay in everything from horseboxes and giant beehives, to a double-decker bus, a treehouse and even a full-size helicopter.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some aren’t cheap, but they may include luxuries such as hot tubs, fire pits and open-air showers. Others have fewer facilities and are short on space, but they represent great value and fun for families, and are close to open countryside and attractions. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here are some of the best glamping ideas. It’s best to check exactly what is provided before you book, and prices quoted are per night unless otherwise stated.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>BEST FOR TREE-HUGGERS</strong></p><img id="i-fd7d63f33406e301" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/10/4CD65B2200000578-0-The_treehouse_in_Dorset-a-30_1527932778446.jpg" height="845" width="962" alt="This treehouse (above) is located in Yonder Hill, West Dorset, and is the 'ultimate in hideaways', says Wendy Gomersall" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-559f27bdc17ae39d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/10/4CD65B1A00000578-0-The_treehouse_luxurious_bath-a-29_1527932778425.jpg" height="1059" width="962" alt="Stunning: The treehouse comes with a double-ended luxurious copper bath with incredible views of the woodland " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Where:</strong> Crafty Camping, Yonder Hill, Holditch, West Dorset.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What makes it special:</strong> The ultimate in hideaways, this ultra-cool, luxurious, handcrafted treehouse for two isn’t cheap but it comes with a double-ended copper bath, open-air shower, spiral staircase leading to a spa deck with hot tub and sauna, and even a pizza oven.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Children welcome? </strong>No, it’s adults-only.

A happy family sit around a blazing fire with no one else in sight. Since it was born at the height of the California flowerpower era, that seductive fantasy has remained a bucketlist aspiration for many of us. It looks so easy – but the 21st Century reality of the hippy holiday dream takes a little more thought. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My first campervan trip ended with me sleeping in a borrowed tent because the kids hated sleeping in the ‘roof’ beds. So make sure you pick the right motorhome. A modern vehicle may not have the appeal of the VW original but it can be a lot more comfortable. And rather than a beautiful empty beach, you could end up in a noisy campsite miles from the sea. So here are ten tips to help you avoid the pitfalls… </p><img id="i-b7202a1fc7a86f85" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/12/4CD65B1600000578-5797997-Freedom_A_vintage_campervan_parked_up_on_an_empty_pebbled_beach_-a-35_1527940183925.jpg" height="610" width="914" alt="Freedom: A vintage campervan parked up on an empty pebbled beach (above)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>1. KEEP IT SIMPLE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’re new to motorhoming, try a simple campervan experience first. Hire a vehicle for a weekend and drive to the nearest National Park or seaside. Even then you’ll need to research where you can park for the night – you can’t just stop anywhere you fancy. Campsites offer facilities but may not fit your wild camping fantasy. Sites such as <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://park4night.com/">park4night.com</a> have lots of suggestions for more edgy overnight spots. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>2. BOOK YOUR HOME EARLY</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before you make too many plans, make sure you can get your campervan – there is a limited range available, so do book early. You can find all sorts of motorhomes at the dedicated comparison site <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://cheapmotorhomes.co.uk/">cheapmotorhomes.co.uk</a>. For a classic VW Camper, try <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://camperbug.co.uk/">camperbug.co.uk</a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>3. TAKE THINGS SLOWLY </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Any sort of motorhome will be slower and more unwieldy to drive than you are used to. American- style motorhomes need special care – they can be a couple of feet wider than a car. The first time I tried to park a campervan, I crashed it into my own car. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>4. DON’T FORGET ESSENTIALS </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Check what is included with the hire vehicle and make a list of what you need to bring. Don’t spend a bank holiday looking for a shop that sells tin-openers. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>5. ENJOY THE FREEDOM</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You may plan a route, but once you’re out there, there’s no need to stick to any schedule. It takes a bit of getting used to amid our finely timetabled lives, but the whole point of the campervan dream is that you can stop for an extra day to enjoy anything you stumble upon – or simply drive off to discover something new. </p><img id="i-1c094197eeab63e7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/12/4CD7307500000578-5797997-Plan_your_meals_and_buy_food_in_advance_says_The_Mail_on_Sunday_-a-37_1527940338853.jpg" height="610" width="914" alt="Plan your meals and buy food in advance, says The Mail on Sunday's Simon Heptinstall. But remember to think about things that you can cook in cramped circumstances" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>6. GO WITH PEOPLE YOU LIKE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You’ll be stuck next to the other passengers for days, so if you must invite friends, make sure they’re good ones. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>7. PLAN YOUR MEALS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Unless your holiday dream involves non-stop takeaways, plan meals and buy food in advance. Think about things that you can cook in cramped circumstances, and remember storage might be limited. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>8. PREPARE TO EXTEND</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">My own first motorhome experience showed I needed more space immediately. So awnings and tents are a great idea. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>9. AVOID MESS STRESS</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The secret of staying in a confined space is to keep everything in its place. Don’t spend the holiday looking for matches or socks: regularly putting things away will save hours of can’t-find-it angst later. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>10. STAY WARM</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the campervan fantasy, everyone wore shorts – but in the UK that might not do. Be sure to bring warm clothes and lots of blankets to use at night. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span class="mol-style-italic"><strong>By Simon Heptinstall</strong></span></p>                            </div>                        </div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Here's our pick of the best 'glamping' sites in the UK.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s an impressive back story to the Royal Oak. When the pub was forced by its brewery company owners to close in 2007, there were plans to convert it into two houses, which no doubt would have fetched a pretty sum in this unspoilt part of rural Wiltshire. But the village of Swallowcliffe had other ideas.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Three families clubbed together to buy the partly thatched building (one of the chimney stacks bears the date 1705) and then set about transforming it into what it is today — a local pub with a good restaurant and seven comfortable rooms upstairs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A group of farmers is in on a Monday night, drinking pints in their Wellies, one of them with a dog spread out on the stone floor. </p><img id="i-52ffffaf17aaa17b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/09/4CD6525F00000578-0-image-a-12_1527926908226.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Homely: The Royal Oak (above) is located in the village of Swallowcliffe in Wiltshire " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">My room is big and unprepossessing — a little spartan even. There’s a pine sleigh bed and Ikea-style furniture. It’s functional. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Somehow it doesn’t feel dressed and lacks a woman’s touch — albeit I could do without the three sanitary towels left in the top drawer of one of the bedside tables.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Downstairs, young local staff give it a homely feel, and whoever is in the kitchen knows his or her stuff. My pork belly is superb and generous, the crackling perfectly crisp.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">There’s a warming fire in the old part of the building, and meals can also be taken in an oak-framed extension at the back.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Breakfast is served there, where the buffet is derisory, but the coffee keeps coming and my poached eggs on avocado and toasted sourdough are excellent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Royal Oak aims to be ‘a pub where people leave happier than when they arrive’.

Every citizen had a duty to keep the city beautiful; dropping litter was a crime against your neighbours.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Here was a tall order: could we go a full week without a shop? That might sound attractive to the more intrepid, but not to an urban family of five who can seldom reach lunchtime without needing the supermarket.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As it turned out, the lack of shops was no problem at all during our week sailing around Turkey's Turquoise Coast. In fact, we have rarely eaten better. For in among this patchwork of isles and inlets in south-west Turkey lurk all manner of excellent, family-run restaurants and even the odd floating bakery. And you can only access them by boat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You certainly do not need to be a sailor to enjoy the thrill of a sailing holiday, of waking up in a new place every day and jumping over the side, of a guaranteed sea view for a fraction of the price of a villa or hotel at the water's edge.</p><img id="i-f235ba55600c5dc3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/17/04BFF5D6000007D0-5787537-image-a-1_1527696484050.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="Shipshape: Robert and his family in Turkey’s Cold Water Bay during their flotilla holiday" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">We booked our week through Sunscape Yachting, Surrey-based experts in boat holidays all over Europe and the Caribbean. They will not only sort you out with a sailing or motor boat, but also someone to sail it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a sailor myself, I took charge of our boat on this trip. But I wanted to try something I had never done before and join a flotilla. This is where you sail in a group, do your own thing by day and then meet up in a new place at the end of the day.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Each Sunscape flotilla has an experienced professional team who go ahead to arrange everything. It means when you arrive in a harbour, even in high season, you have somewhere to tie up, someone waiting to help moor your boat without scratching the paintwork and a reservation at a tried-and-tested restaurant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In other words, it removes the most stressful aspects of a family sailing holiday. The result is less shouting and rather more sundowner time at sundown. Plus you make friends on the way.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We were one of ten boats sailing from Fethiye, the boating centre of the Turquoise Coast. It is also the home of Sunscape's Turkish partner, who organise flotillas and yacht charters in these parts. Our boat, much to the children's delight, was called Scooby-Doo, a 36ft Oceanis with three two-bed cabins.</p><img id="i-22566f00284d8a8d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/17/4CC2A2EB00000578-5787537-image-a-2_1527696901989.jpg" height="420" width="634" alt="Nautical hub: The harbour at Fethiye, the glorious boating centre of the Turquoise Coast" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Each day began with a short briefing on the evening destination and good spots for lunch. Nowhere was more than a few hours' sailing away, allowing plenty of time for swimming. The evening rendezvous could be anywhere in the Gulf of Fethiye, with a dozen islands and umpteen bays to choose from. In Kapi Creek we tied up on a small quayside by a restaurant serving big plates of mezze and kebabs for only a tenner a head. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Though there was no sign of any shops, the parp of a horn the next morning announced the arrival of a fishing boat converted into a roving corner store. Even more remote was 22 Fathom Cove. Here, we woke up to the magical whiff of a floating bakery producing soft Turkish loaves at 50p a go.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Best of all was Cold Water Bay, so-called because of an underground spring running straight into the sea here. It was not so much 'cold' as a few degrees below the rest of the Turquoise Coast — delicious. It is overlooked by a clifftop restaurant run by a delightful couple who give a free cooked breakfast to anyone who had dinner there the night before.</p><img id="i-8b636edb5524018b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/17/4CC2A2DC00000578-5787537-image-a-3_1527696915270.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="Pick your vessel: Sunscape works with Yildiz Yachting to offer a spectrum of charter boats" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our flotilla was mainly British, plus a sailing mad family from Holland. Some were keen to sail all day, others pottered along at a leisurely pace. It didn't matter. There was great camaraderie.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When our eldest ignored instructions to wear flip-flops on an old jetty and ended up with a chunk of wood in her foot, people were on hand in seconds with first aid kits. Since our flotilla included a doctor and nurse, a husband and wife team from Herefordshire, she was fixed up in no time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Equally impressive was the fact that one thing never came out of our medical kit: mosquito spray.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I have been bitten to pieces all over the Mediterranean down the years, but the Turquoise Coast is mosquito-free. I don't know how Turkey does it and I am not sure I want to know. But to sleep under the stars and wake without angry, itchy bites all over one's arms and legs is one of life's great pleasures. It's almost as good as waking up to freshly baked bread in the middle of nowhere.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-506abd60-641a-11e8-bf2a-d11357a85180">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TRAVEL FACTS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Sunscape Yachting (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="https://sunscapeyachting.co.uk/">sunscapeyachting.co.uk</a>, 01737 300 805) has flotilla sailing holidays in Turkey, France, Greece and Croatia from £1,695 a week for a six-person charter yacht with Yildiz Yachting (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" href="http://www.yildizyachting.com/">yildizyachting.com</a>).

It was a bit of light relief because it could get quite intense back on the base,' Adam said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before he moved to South Georgia, the former policeman said he had never skied before but he quickly got to grips with skidding through the snow armed with two poles.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: 'Skiing is a great pastime.

Quite a bit, it turns out. Here he provides an account of his journey from London to New York and back in both cabins and discovers that when you pay top dollar, the food is far superior, the seat can be moved in multiple directions - and forms a bed - and the TV screen is huge. And rather than diabolical free headphones, you get an over-the-ear Hi-Fi quality set. The two food pictures on the right show a chicken dinner in business and a chicken dinner in economy.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to the World Health Organisation, Africa and South-East Asia have the highest burden of food borne diseases per population.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Are there any things that travellers should avoid while they are away?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is some evidence to say an upset stomach is going to be an unwelcome visitor in the first seven days after arrival at a destination.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But if you take extra care during the first week, you should be just fine to enjoy your holiday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remember hot and humid countries are going to carry more bugs on their food and in their water.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Never drink tap water</strong></p><img id="i-35b0fe1c3594c2ab" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/16/4CC275AB00000578-5787433-image-a-9_1527694613706.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Dr Daniel says avoiding tap water is one way to avoid falling ill. She advises always drinking bottled water " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">That goes for brushing your teeth. It goes for ice in your drinks. It goes for fruit that's washed in tap water. Always drink bottled water, ensuring the seal is intact when you purchase it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Avoid certain food</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Remember sauces, condiments to street foods and so on may be watered down using tap water.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ensure all food you eat is hot, cooked at the right temperature to ensure the bacteria are taken care of.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Avoid salads and food that's been sat out at buffets for instance. Uncooked seafood is a common culprit in many developed countries like Spain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Eat where the locals go</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While indulging in local street food may make you feel like you are immersing yourself in the indigenous culture, this stuff is usually not subject to the same sanitary standards as a restaurant.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hedge your bets on the one with a queue of locals. Check for cleanliness even in established restaurants, paying attention to the state of tablecloths, cutlery, glasses and whether the tables are wiped down properly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Wash your hands</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is the next most effective way of preventing sickness on holiday, next to drinking bottled water.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Always wash your hands with soap and water where possible. If the tap water is suspect, make sure you carry alcohol gel or wipes with you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Stick to peelable fruit</strong></p><img id="i-2e00d837b0d6949a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/16/4CC2759D00000578-5787433-image-a-10_1527694633521.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The best fruit to eat while away is peelable fruit such as bananas, pineapple and mangoes" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bananas, mangoes and the like are perfectly fine to eat. Avoid anything that has already been peeled, chopped and is waiting in handy takeaway sizes for you.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Eat smaller amounts</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Simple maths. Less bugs in the body, less harmful effect on it. Also gives your body more time to deal with it if the incoming food poisoning causing bugs are in small quantities.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What are the main symptoms of food poisoning, and are there any ways that you can ease these?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The main symptoms of food poisoning are diarrhoea and vomiting. This may or may not be associated with fevers and shivers. Sometimes you may also have a stomach ache. Fatigue, headaches and muscle aches are also possible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What should you do if you begin to experience the symptoms of food poisoning?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you do experience an upset stomach, make sure to drink plenty of fluids.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sticking to water where possible or dilute juices. Carbonated drinks may make you feel worse. Stick to paracetamol for fever, aches and tummy pain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eat bland foods like plain rice, soup, plain toast. Bananas and apples will help bulk up stools. It may be worth drinking oral rehydration fluids. They usually come in sachets for you to reconstitute.</p><img id="i-cb40d9eccd34f3be" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/16/4CC2759800000578-5787433-image-a-11_1527694639369.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Dr Daniel says it is worth seeking medical help if you have prolonged diarrhoea, severe stomach pains or high fever" class="blkBorder img-share" /><div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS travel" data-version="2" id="mol-0b79d220-64a3-11e8-b6c2-471b94e773d2">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">Where are you most likely to get food poisoning on holiday? </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) African and South-East Asian regions have the highest burden of foodborne diseases, though because of their popularity with holidaymakers, countries such as Spain, Mexico and India are also often associated with dodgy stomachs.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The WHO says that one in 10 people (600million globally) fall ill every year from eating contaminated food and 420,000 die as a result.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Children under five years of age are at particularly high risk, with 125,000 children dying from foodborne diseases every year.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Diarrhoeal diseases are responsible for more than half of the global burden of foodborne diseases, causing 550 million people to fall ill and 230 000 deaths every year. Children are at particular risk of foodborne diarrhoeal diseases, with 220 million falling ill and 96 000 dying every year. Diarrhoea is often caused by eating raw or undercooked meat, eggs, fresh produce and dairy products contaminated by norovirus, Campylobacter, non-typhoidal Salmonella and pathogenic E. coli.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Other major contributors to the global burden of foodborne diseases are typhoid fever, hepatitis A, Taenia solium (a tapeworm), and aflatoxin (produced by mould on grain that is stored inappropriately).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Certain diseases, such as those caused by non-typhoidal Salmonella, are a public health concern across all regions of the world, in high- and low-income countries alike. Other diseases, such as typhoid fever, foodborne cholera, and those caused by pathogenic E. coli, are much more common to low-income countries, while Campylobacter is an important pathogen in high-income countries.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The risk of foodborne diseases is most severe in low and middle-income countries, linked to preparing food with unsafe water; poor hygiene and inadequate conditions in food production and storage; lower levels of literacy and education; and insufficient food safety legislation or implementation of such legislation, the WHO said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What are the best treatment options available? Are there any essentials that you should pack, or look out for while you are in a foreign country?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bearing in mind most gastroenteritis or upset stomachs tend to be because of common viruses, it does not need any medical treatment. It is always worth packing anti-sickness tablets, paracetamol and oral rehydration sachets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Loperamide or Imodium is OK to take if necessary but remember if there are bugs making toxins in your bowels as can happen during a diarrhoeal illness, you want these toxins out. Keeping them bunged up can cause swelling in your bowel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How long should you wait if you are experiencing the symptoms before seeking medical help?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Typically, 48 hours is a viral diarrhoea, but it can vary depending on what is causing it. If you stay hydrated, avoid triggers and keep your diet bland, the symptoms should disappear on their own.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is worth seeking medical help if you have prolonged diarrhoea, severe stomach pains, high fever, blood in your stools or you are unable to drink fluids.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Is there anything that you can request from your doctor prior to flying out to prevent food poisoning, and how would you know where to look for medical support if you are in a foreign country?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rather than seeing a doctor before flying, see your practice nurse. They will recommend all the necessary travel vaccines for your destination that will prevent you from having severe bacterial illness. They will also give you general travel advice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is worth considering malaria prophylaxis if needed. I would suggest considering probiotic supplements (they come in capsule form in health food shops) to help prevent diarrhoea. These can help viral and some bacterial gastroenteritis.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Always carry adequate travel insurance. The embassy website usually gives you advice on how to seek medical help where you are. Your hotel concierge usually is your first port of call.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The big "branded" hotels may even have an in-house visiting doctor. A local pharmacist is always a good shout for minor ailments and they will be able to signpost you to a doctor nearby. Failing all of this and if you are feeling very unwell, the big hospitals should all have an emergency department you can attend.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><br /></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Having an upset stomach is upsetting at any time, it is particularly annoying when on holiday.

Now it's getting a break. After Friday, the daily influx of dozens of boats and thousands of visitors unsuccessfully scrambling for an unspoiled view of Maya Bay's emerald waters and glistening white sand will end. The attraction is being closed for four months to give its coral reefs and sea life a chance to recover. Thailand has promoted unfettered tourism for decades and the onslaught on Maya Bay, which is on Phi Phi Leh Island in the Andaman Sea, has only picked up pace in recent years. Authorities now say they are striving to balance profit and conservation and the closure will happen every year.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>AP</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Wires</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-05-31T11:15:48.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Shocking pictures show the crowds at Maya Bay</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-05-31T11:15:48.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5787433/Top-doctor-reveals-avoid-food-poisoning-holiday-it.html" title="From only eating peelable fruit to washing your hands A LOT: Top doctor reveals how to avoid food poisoning on holiday (and what to do if you get it)"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5786017/British-cave-house-undergoes-restoration-perfect-couples-retreat-195-night.html" title="Inside the cave you can rent!

Here's a selection of some of his wackier non-starters...</strong></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>OBESE TAX:</strong> In 2009 Ryanair said it was considering an excess weight fee for very large customers after 30,000 people voted in favour of the measure on its website. More than 100,000 passengers gave on-line feedback on various cost-cutting ideas put forward by Ryanair. Almost one in three people polled thought obese and overweight people should be charged more for tickets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>TOILET CHARGE:</strong> In 2010 Ryanair announced it was pushing ahead with its controversial idea to start <span style="font-size: 16px;">charging for lavatories. It said all onboard toilets would become coin-operated, forcing passengers to pay £1 or one euro. </span>The Irish airline revealed it was also cutting the number of loos, meaning there could only one on planes carrying 189 passengers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>STANDING ROOM ONLY:</strong> In 2011 Ryanair said it will introduce ‘standing-room only’ areas on its flights.The low cost carrier announced proposals to install new ‘vertical seats’ on a range of short haul flights. The 'seats', which would allow passengers to be ‘strapped in’ while standing up, drew criticism from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which raised doubts over whether they would pass safety tests. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>IN-FLIGHT PORN:</strong> In 2011 boss Michael O’Leary said he hoped to launch an in-flight pay-per-view pornography service for passengers to watch during flights. Passengers would be able to watch erotic content via an app, which would also offer games and gambling opportunities.  </p>                            </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The airline credited some of the growth to the success of its dedicated technology team Ryanair Labs, which has worked on its website and app to increase customers' take-up of extra services.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The extra charges on top of airfares now make up 28 per cent of Ryanair's revenue and it said: 'We are well on track to achieve our five year goal of 30 per cent.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The €2billion of ancillary revenues revealed in the airline's results equates to €5.48million a day or £4.81million.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ryanair saw full-year revenues and profits rise, despite cancelling over 20,000 flights last year after mismanaging pilots' annual leave.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-d1570490-6412-11e8-b189-b15b19e6e45a">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">RYANAIR CONTROVERSIES</h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>NOT REFUNDING THE DEAD:</strong> In 2013 Ryanair  apologised after it refused to refund the ticket of a dead passenger because it said she had died too soon before her flight. Beryl Parsons, 78, was due to fly to the Canary Islands with her son and grandchildren for a holiday in October. But in June, four months before the flight, she was unexpectedly told she only had three weeks to live and died.  Her son, Doug, 44, wrote to the budget airline to ask for a refund for his mother’s £230 share of the £1,074 airfares from Stansted to Fuerteventura and included a copy of her death certificate. But it refused because it said Mrs Parsons, who had cancer, had died more than 28 days before the booked flight. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>PILOT OUTRAGE: </strong>In 2017 <span style="font-size: 16px;">Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary reportedly apologised to pilots, offering them incentives to stay with the carrier in a personal letter. </span>O’Leary is said to have asked pilots not to move to rival airlines, promising pay increases, a 'productivity/loyalty bonus' and 'significant improvements' to contracts and career progression. It followed the cancellation of tens of thousands of flights earlier that year because of errors in how pilots were rostered for work, disrupting the travel plans of 700,000 passengers. </p></div>                        </div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>It appears that the priority boarding fee to ensure passengers can keep both carry-on bags with them in the cabin on board the Irish-based carrier has been raised on certain flights.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ted Thornhill</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-05-30T21:03:41.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Ryanair quietly raises the price of taking two bags on flights</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-05-30T21:03:41.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5785785/Singapore-Airlines-launch-worlds-longest-flight.html" title="Singapore Airlines to launch world's longest flight from Changi to New York - but not for economy passengers"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5786623/Inside-Singapore-Airlines-stunning-new-787-10-Dreamliner.html" title="Inside Singapore Airlines' stunning new 787-10 Dreamliner, which features the same material used in the interiors of luxury sports cars and yachts"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5786079/The-landmarks-tourists-trickiest-photograph.html" title="Revealed: The landmarks that tourists find the trickiest to photograph, from Buckingham Palace to the Matterhorn"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5786017/British-cave-house-undergoes-restoration-perfect-couples-retreat-195-night.html" title="Inside the cave you can rent!

Pictured: An exterior shot of the cave house (main), the kitchen (top right) and the living room (bottom right).</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ted Thornhill</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-05-30T22:54:15.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Inside the cave you can rent!</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-05-30T22:54:15.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5785785/Singapore-Airlines-launch-worlds-longest-flight.html" title="Singapore Airlines to launch world's longest flight from Changi to New York - but not for economy passengers"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5761947/The-incredible-private-island-resorts-revealed.html" title="The most incredible private island resorts EVER: Hire an entire rocky outcrop in Ibiza for £22k - or stay at a marooned luxury hotel in Venice for £350"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5779237/Travellers-reveal-cities-like-movies.html" title="'They don't show people getting stuck in traffic forever': Travellers reveal the cities that are nothing like how they're portrayed in movies"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5782389/Welcome-town-Cool-California.html" title="Welcome to the town of Cool in California (but does it live up to its name?)"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5782075/Candid-footage-captures-passengers-looks-joy-theyre-given-Virgin-Atlantic-flight-upgrades.html" title="The smile high club!

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">These include Birmingham International, Glasgow Central, Milton Keynes Central, Manchester Piccadilly, Edinburgh Waverley and Edinburgh Haymarket.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The deal does not apply to the return leg of the journey. There will be a two-week testing period in which customers will give feedback.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sarah Copley of Virgin Trains said: 'We know that tackling the first and final mile is critical to opening up rail travel to new customers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Our exciting new partnership with Uber is the next step in making this end-to-end journey easy and seamless for

class="mol-para-with-font">'This partnership with Virgin Trains is an exciting first step towards offering customers an easy way to combine train and car travel at the touch of a button.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, others criticised the partnership including Amanda Gearing, an official with the GMB union.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She explained: 'Virgin Trains teaming with Uber is not good news.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The licensing of taxis sits with individual local authorities, who take account of many factors, including safety and size of the market.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This partnership tramples over our local democracy and we've already heard councils raising issues about this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Concerns about commuters' safety and risks to the livelihood of many taxi drivers have been side-stepped to promote the interests of a public sector privateer and a company that refuses to give workers employment rights.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Critics of Uber insist it fails to properly vet its drivers and is an example of the so-called 'gig economy' that gives workers no employment rights.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In October 2016 the taxi firm lost a landmark employment tribunal ruling that its drivers should be classed as workers rather than being self-employed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It had claimed its employment arrangements allowed its drivers across England and Wales to be their own boss and work flexibly, but the tribunal panel gave a scathing dismissal of Uber's arguments.</p><img id="i-fae212a26058e9ab" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/09/2D7623ED00000578-5785957-image-a-2_1527668623783.jpg" height="571" width="634" alt="Customers on the West Coast line will have the option to receive a text reminding them to book an Uber taxi to the station or for when they arrive at their destination" class="blkBorder

capital.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">TfL raised a number of issues when it stripped the ride-hailing firm of its licence, including Uber's approach to reporting serious criminal offences, how drivers' medical certificates are obtained, how criminal record checks are carried out, and its use of technology, which allegedly helps it to evade law enforcement officials.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Uber launched its appeal in mid-October and will be heard at Westminster Magistrate's Court at the end of June.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Councillor Jayne Innes, Coventry Council Cabinet Member for City Services, added: 'This is incredibly disappointing news for locally licensed taxis, and for the Black Cab industry up and down the country.</p><p

It sits right next to the South West Coast Path and, if you’re inclined to leave its cosy sitting rooms or spacious gardens, you’re only a short drive from Salcombe and Bantham beach.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While the children – I say this out of habit, as they are now in their 30s! – did manage to fit in a daily swim in the outdoor pool, I spent most of my stay pottering around the gardens, which are scattered with lovely little seating areas, all perfectly placed to make the most of those glorious sea views.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As a regular practitioner of meditation, the location couldn’t have offered more space, peace and beauty for my morning contemplations. There’s a croquet lawn but as a golfer, it was pretty heavenly, too, with its own par 3 course. And if that’s not enough, right opposite the hotel, there’s Thurlestone’s own Harry Colt-designed golf course, which must surely be one of the most picturesque in the country.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Afternoon tea was my favourite meal, served at whatever seat I’d chosen that day and followed by a gentle stroll that was supposed to do the job of working off the clotted cream calories.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our visit in the spring was timely, as we arrived just as the hotel restaurant reopened after a refit. This meant that dinner each night was enjoyed at a table by the huge new picture windows with yet more fabulous views.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The dog was spoilt almost as much as we were, with a welcome pack of organic snacks and his own ball to play with. During our forays down to the beach and along the coast each day, he romped while we strolled and chatted with walkers.</p><img id="i-e35d28d3782855d1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/13/4CA3B28B00000578-0-image-a-71_1527337562386.jpg" height="388" width="634" alt="Tranquil: The croquet lawn at the Thurlestone Hotel in the village of Thurlestone, south Devon" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">We only ventured out in the car once.

This pretty fishing town sits on the Kingsbridge Estuary and is a muddle of seaside shops, waterfront cafes, restaurants and fishermen’s boats bobbing in the harbour.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was a pleasure to explore a little beyond our secluded enclave in Thurlestone – and an even greater pleasure to head back there for the final cosy night of our escape.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-bce55600-60df-11e8-ad61-39d36084ba88">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TRAVEL FACTS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Prices at Thurlestone Hotel start from £230 per room per night, based on two adults sharing a sea-view room on a bed-and-breakfast basis.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Since I was five years old I’ve wanted to achieve two things – land on the Moon and visit Antarctica. My childhood heroes were Mr Spock from the Star Trek TV series and polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Sadly I have had to accept that travelling to outer space is but a pipe dream, but I could hardly contain my joy when I learned there was a trip to Antarctica which would follow Shackleton’s epic journey of just over a hundred years ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Shackleton, known to his men as ‘The Boss’, was attempting to be the first to cross the entire continent of Antarctica in 1915 when his vessel Endurance was trapped and crushed by pack ice.</p><img id="i-ab979a4ca4453ce7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/11/4CA3B26E00000578-0-Saluting_her_hero_Lorraine_raises_a_glass_to_the_memory_of_Ernes-a-27_1527328854408.jpg" height="425" width="634" alt="Saluting her hero: Lorraine (above) raises a glass to the memory of Ernest Shackleton" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">What followed was one of the most incredible and heroic feats of survival against all the odds.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">After landing there, ‘The Boss’ and two of his men who could still walk, Tom Crean and Frank Worsley, somehow trudged across the unmapped mountainous interior of the island. They stumbled into Stromness whaling station and eventually Shackleton was able to get back to Elephant Island to pick up the 22 men who had been stranded there for four months.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The chance to witness the places I had read so much about was irresistible.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We joined our ship Hebridean Sky in Ushuaia at the very southern tip of Argentina, sailed down the Beagle Channel and braced ourselves for the infamously rough Drake Passage, known as the worst sea crossing in the world.</p><img id="i-979f96f1921316fb" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/10/4CA3B26300000578-0-image-a-13_1527328628141.jpg" height="470" width="634" alt="Mesmerising: Penguins perch on a marvellously sculpted iceberg" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was a bit queasy, but manageable, and our comfy cabin was designed to make sure everything stayed in place, including us, even in the roughest of conditions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One of the best things about the trip was the crew of passionate experts.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Expedition leader Hannah Lawson is a force of nature, bursting with facts about wildlife. Also on board was fellow Shackleton nut and ex-Royal Navy officer Seb Coulthard, who earned my respect as one of a crew of enthusiasts who had recreated Shackleton’s epic journey in a replica of the James Caird, even wearing the same clothing and eating the same food.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The days spent sailing towards Antarctica were magical. As well as fascinating talks, there was the chance to sit on deck and look for whales and bird life.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our first proper stop was Deception Island just north of the Antarctic peninsula. It’s a ring-shaped active volcano that you can sail into through a squeakily tight entrance called Neptune’s Bellows. The water here is supposed to be slightly thermally heated, so a handful of us decided to be brave and do a polar plunge.</p><img id="i-778b425220c466f4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/10/4CA3B27800000578-0-image-a-16_1527328688112.jpg" height="396" width="306" alt="Ernest Shackleton, pictured above in 1909" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I knew I’d probably never get the chance again so I stripped off all my many layers down to my bikini (bizarrely I kept my hat, scarf and gloves on) and dashed into the freezing water, only to quickly start yelping and bounce right back out again. I was numb from the neck down but thawed out back on board with hot chocolate laced with Baileys.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some practical advice for a trip like this: you need lots of layers and really good gloves. Polar Latitudes provided us with boots, which you have to give back, but also gave us all a bright red warm jacket that you get to keep and I’ve been wearing ever since. Waterproof trousers are a must and it’s a good idea to have seasickness medication.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As we headed even further south, the air became much chillier and we soon spotted our first iceberg. I spent many happy hours looking at these floating sculptures carved by nature, the wind and waves, with all the different shades of blue and green.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was a very special morning when we landed on Cuverville Island to a welcoming committee of king penguins. They are so tame and will come up close if you stand still – but they soon get bored and find something better to do.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The baby fur seals are hilariously full of cockiness and attitude and will bound up to you like aggressive puppies, but all you have to do is look at them and say ‘boo’ very softly and they scarper.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Before leaving the ship for the first time, our gear, including boots, waterproof trousers, jackets and rucksacks were thoroughly checked to make sure we weren’t inadvertently carrying anything that might contaminate this pristine continent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We had to dunk our boots in a basin of disinfectant when climbing into the small Zodiacs that took us from the ship to land, and when coming back on board. It’s all about protecting the wildlife and the environment. At night we had to enforce a ‘blackout’ with lights off and curtains closed so we didn’t confuse any birds which could have been injured or killed bashing into the windows.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We managed to sail very close to Elephant Island, but the wind and seas were too rough to land. The deck froze up and it was almost impossible to stand upright in the fierce gales.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I cannot image how Shackleton’s men spent even one night there and it brought home to all of us their sheer bravery and tenacity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It was such an incredible feeling to see with my own eyes those places I had read about for so many years, and to be following Shackleton’s journey, although our conditions could not have been more different. We were thoroughly spoiled in our cosy cabin, with fantastic food served in the dining room and hot tea and coffee always on tap.</p><img id="i-b26cc4c856085030" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/10/4CA3B22600000578-0-image-a-17_1527328691586.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Going ashore: A zodiac sets off from Hebridean Sky's sister vessel, Island Sky" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">One evening, after being ashore, the crew surprised us by cooking a barbecue on deck. We all wrapped up well in just about all of the clothes we had brought with us and huddled under blankets to enjoy the food and wine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For me, South Georgia was the highlight of the trip. The wildlife was astonishing, and at St Andrews Bay I felt as if I was in a scene from the movie Happy Feet. There were so many penguins as far as the eye could see.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Also on South Georgia I was able to pay my respects to Shackleton, who was buried in the small cemetery near the former whaling station of Grytviken after suffering a heart attack on another expedition in 1921. It was such a quiet and still morning with everything covered in snow when we landed and then crunched up the path to his grave. It’s obligatory to toast ‘The Boss’ with a right good dram of whisky and I found it very emotional, especially having just sailed that same 800-mile journey from Elephant Island.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Grytviken, there’s a beautiful church with a small library, a fabulous museum and gift shop, and a post office where you can send postcards which will arrive a couple of months after you get home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">During our voyage around South Georgia, we made many stops to enjoy the wildlife. We saw leopard seals slide sneakily into the water looking for unwary penguins, glaciers calving, and whales larking about and having fun.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-9c9e1d70-624a-11e8-aea3-2d5676c58b56">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox"> I was so enthralled I didn’t take a photo, but I will have the image in my mind for ever</div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">We also learned so much about Shackleton’s journey and even retraced some of his steps into the former whaling station in Stromness where he found help. It is deserted now apart from giant elephant seals, some cheeky young fur seal pups and a few little South Georgia pipits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The bird life on the island has a made a remarkable recovery thanks to a recent programme to rid South Georgia of rats brought in by the whaling ships. The voracious rodents almost wiped out vulnerable species of bird life by eating their eggs and chicks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I stayed on deck as we said goodbye to this magnificent island, and as the sun went down there was a flash of black and white and a school of dolphins put on a farewell show, leaping like ballet dancers, just for me. I was so enthralled I didn’t take a photo, but I will have the image in my mind for ever.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From South Georgia, we stopped briefly at the Falklands and I would have loved to have spent more time there. It reminded me of the Outer Hebrides, but with the added bonus of penguins. It was lovely to feel so at home, even though we were so very far away.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I feel very blessed to have visited Antarctica and South Georgia and I would go back again in a heartbeat. In the middle of a traffic jam or packed in a sweaty, crowded, dirty train, bus or Underground carriage, I often think back to my time there and wish I could transport myself to the snow and the ice.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-b1db26f0-60ca-11e8-ad61-39d36084ba88">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TRAVEL FACTS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Polar Latitudes (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://polar-latitudes.com/">polar-latitudes.com</a>) offers voyages to the Antarctic aboard Hebridean Sky.

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Continuing our series featuring the holiday memories of famous people, former Wham! star Andrew Ridgeley, 55, recalls his lifetime of adventures…</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My first holiday I remember:</strong> A two-week family trip to Swanage when I was five or six. I remember building sandcastles on the beach with my brother and the weather being nice. We stayed in a caravan and took a boat trip out to The Needles. Another holiday was to Devon and I remember driving along the A39 in my father’s laden-down, primrose-yellow Ford Anglia, which really struggled to get up the steep inclines.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My first trip abroad: </strong>Was to the Loire Valley, when I was ten. We drove from the UK and stayed on a campsite in a big family tent. My father got lost en route, which was a bit trying for my mum. She dragged my brother, myself and my dad around numerous French chateaux which we weren’t keen on seeing. We were far more interested in playing in the river that ran through the campsite, even though I had broken my arm just before the holiday.</p><img id="i-c05bb3f89802aa85" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/12/4CA3B29A00000578-0-image-a-57_1527335936852.jpg" height="425" width="634" alt="Let's go-go: Andrew with Wham! co-star George Michael in the 1980s " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My first school trip: </strong>We went to the Wye Valley when I was at my primary school. There were four of us to a chalet and it was the time when streaking was a new and exciting pursuit, so there was a fair bit of that going on. We locked one of our mates out of the chalet, and he was desperately running around the camp trying to get back in before the teachers came to check on whether we had gone to bed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My most adventurous holiday: </strong>A few days visiting Nicaragua from Costa Rica in the early 1990s. It wasn’t long after the revolution. There was no food to buy so I ate a lot of pineapples, so much so that the inside of my mouth began to peel. I remember riding in the back of a pick-up truck getting covered in dust. We camped and had to survive on very little, so it wasn’t much of a holiday. We were also searching for surf, and that didn’t go well either. I remember waiting at border control for three hours and having to give them a few dollars to get through.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My best holiday: </strong>For my 50th birthday, I took some friends to Selva Val Gardena in Italy’s South Tyrol for a week. I rarely go to the same place twice, but I’ve discovered a very nice hotel there and often go back. That week was a corker – the skiing was great and the company was terrific, and I had a jolly good time. I have been there in the summer months, too, for cycling. The Dolomites are stunning.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My worst holiday ever: </strong>A ten-day surf trip on a boat out of Malé in The Maldives. I went with a group of friends but there wasn’t any surf. Plus there was no booze on the boat, so I had to eke out my one-litre bottle of whiskey. The carefully measured sundowner was the highlight of our day.</p><img id="i-6abc2cfaa18eb26a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/12/4CA3B29300000578-0-image-m-60_1527335949235.jpg" height="322" width="306" alt="Andrew (above) aged ten on a family trip to the Loire Valley" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Essential holiday item: </strong>A Garmin Edge 1000 if I’m going on a cycling trip. I go on several a year. I have just been to Girona in Spain, and was cycling in Thailand in January. The device records how far you have ridden, how high you have climbed and how much effort you have put in, so it is good to share online so your friends know how you are doing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>My dream destination:</strong> Sardinia for a beach holiday. In the UK I’d choose a Cornish beach and sit in the marram grass, having a picnic with a pint of ale. You can’t beat the sound of a lapping sea and the wind in the grass. Kynance Cove beach is one of the most beautiful.</p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The singer recalls causing mischief on his first school trip and the time he lived off a diet of pineapples in Costa Rica.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">A honeymoon is meant to be a memorable, once-in-a-lifetime experience – and ours certainly delivered. After an eight-hour flight, Kerry and I were met in Nairobi by our beaming driver who took us through the chaotic city to the grand elegance of House of Waine, an 11-bedroom hotel set in gardens, 20 minutes from downtown Nairobi in the quiet suburb of Karen.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our room had a four-poster bed covered in rose petals and there was a bottle of champagne waiting for us. Our candle-lit, private dinner was by an open fire.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Early the next morning, we boarded a small propeller plane for an hour’s flight to the vast Masai Mara, during which our eyes were glued to the breathtaking beauty and wandering wildlife below. We landed on a small, dusty strip and were greeted by Masai warriors in full tribal dress.</p><img id="i-8fa48250e0407183" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/12/4CA3B2C600000578-0-image-a-39_1527333643460.jpg" height="528" width="634" alt="Up close and personal: A pride of lions takes a rest in Kenya's Masai Mara National Reserve " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">After a short drive, we entered our new home, the Naibor Camp, a contemporary tented camp in the heart of the Masai Mara National Reserve, by the Talek river, home to about 50 enormous hippos who would be vocal neighbours for the next four days.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our large tent had its own veranda with a day bed and a private dining area overlooking the river, and our bedroom had a large, beautifully crafted wooden bed and en suite with a hot safari bucket shower.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After a delicious lunch within 30 yards of the bathing hippos, we were set for the first safari with the worldly-wise Jackson, our private guide. It didn’t take us long to encounter two lions in the middle of a late afternoon snooze, the wedding-present camera being put to good use. The feeling of being out in the Mara, encountering wildlife in their natural habitat, was magical.</p><img id="i-70e0b69d8c207700" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/12/4CA3B22E00000578-0-image-a-43_1527333744069.jpg" height="477" width="634" alt="Honeymoon bliss: Nick with his wife Kerry (above) in Zanzibar where they spent five nights" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Back at Naibor Camp, we chatted to the other guests around an open fire and compared notes before supper. Exhausted and awestruck from our day, we were escorted to our tent in the pitch-black darkness by a Masai warrior.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Morning safaris are early but we have never been so excited to wake at 5.30am. We were out for between four and five hours in the morning and three and four in the afternoon, with a chance to chill at lunch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Each day was a new adventure –from following the wildebeest and zebra on their own epic adventure, to crossing the crocodile-infested river and observing cheetahs stealthily plan their next kill.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">We watched a lion feast on his breakfast 3ft from our truck, then stroll, at his own pace, to rejoin his brother, seemingly for a kip under a tree. But then he was up like a flash and gave a deafening roar, and those amber eyes weren’t messing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This was the one time I felt a little nervous, much to my wife’s amusement. During my England career, we had a psychiatrist go through the fight, flight or freeze survival scenarios with different predators, and when it came to a lion he told us to stare him out and approach him. Having now been in this situation, I believe this advice to be ********!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Having made a swift exit, we took it more calmly watching giraffes eating from the tops of the trees, hyenas scavenging for leftovers, and enormous, cantankerous buffalos. There were also multiple sightings of leopards.</p><img id="i-c33be2dcd5b2a5d6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/12/4CA3B27E00000578-0-image-a-44_1527333770356.jpg" height="217" width="634" alt="Wild time: An elephant strolls past during a safari at Naibor Camp in the Masai Mara National Reserve" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">We visited one of the Masai villages and were proudly shown around the homes, made by the women out of cow dung and mud. We danced and sang with them, learning about their way of life – a heart-warming experience.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We also saw the Masai Mara from above in a hot-air balloon. It was slightly terrifying but also exhilarating, and an extraordinary experience. Our incredible memories did not finish out on the safari. In camp we enjoyed private dinners held in the gardens by our tent on the edge of the river.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We were sad to leave Jackson and the team but knew we had another amazing place to explore. So it was a flight back to Nairobi, a quick stopover at House of Waine to freshen up, and then a 90-minute flight to the island of Zanzibar where we would spend the next five nights at the White Sand Luxury Villas &amp; Spa.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To say the hotel exceeded our expectations does not come close to describing how speechless we were when we were shown around our huge villa. We had our own exotic garden, with ‘his and hers’ hammocks to enjoy the star-lit sky at night, a rooftop terrace, pool and outdoor bathtub, all with stunning views of the brilliant white-sand beach – plus a private butler. This was paradise and the perfect tonic following the safari.</p><img id="i-dbc8e646a405d701" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/12/4CA3B22A00000578-0-image-a-45_1527333781007.jpg" height="508" width="634" alt="Lap of luxury: The beach at White Sand resort boasts wonderful white sand and turquoise sea" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">After a guilt-driven workout at the quaint outdoor gym, we took full advantage of the secluded spa and enjoyed a couple’s massage, drifting off into pure relaxation with only the sound of the soothing waterfall in the background.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then we were keen to explore Zanzibar and we organised a boat trip, heading to Mnemba Island, somewhere we had been told was brilliant for snorkelling and the stuff of tropical-island dreams. En route we enjoyed some deep-sea fishing while soaking up the sun.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mnemba was fringed with palms and powdery sand and surrounded by the most stunning cerulean sea, the most pure, beautiful water we had ever seen, and we were soon exploring the colourful reefs and tropical fish. To cap it all, on the way back our boat was surrounded by a pod of dolphins, so there was only one thing to do: jump in for the swim of a lifetime at the end of a trip of a lifetime.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And so, after ten action-packed days, our honeymoon all too quickly came to an end and we returned to London ready to begin our lives as Mr and Mrs Easter.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-9a50bb10-60d6-11e8-ad61-39d36084ba88">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TRAVEL FACTS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">African specialists Safari &amp; Beach (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://safariandbeach.com/">safariandbeach.com</a>, 01548 854125) offer a 12-night holiday to Kenya from £4,250pp, including return flights, transfers, one night’s B&amp;B at the House of Waine (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://houseofwaine.com/">houseofwaine.com</a>), four nights’ full-board at Naibor Camp (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://naibor.com/">naibor.com</a>) and five nights’ half-board at Zanzibar White Sands Luxury Villas &amp; Spa (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://whitesandvillas.com/">whitesandvillas.com</a>).</p>                            </div>                        </div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Nick Easter and his wife Kerry set off on a trip of a lifetime, which included an exhilarating safari in Kenya.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The capital of Majorca is usually bypassed by the throngs landing at its airport on their way to beach holidays – but what a gem they are missing.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Palma is a fabulous city to rival its mainland neighbour Barcelona, but without the crowds or inflated tourist prices. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The charm of the Old Town, with its soaring seafront cathedral, makes it a year-round, city break destination.</p><img id="i-82d559cbde946b32" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/11/4CA3B23A00000578-0-image-a-28_1527332183916.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Saddle up: Cycle routes along the seafront make it easy to get around the city" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>DAY ONE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MORNING</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Get under the skin of the city on a free walking tour.

Just turn up in front of the tourist office below the cathedral at 11am (every day except Sunday).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then stock up with picnic goodies from the displays of fruit, cheese and cold meats at Mercat de L’Olivar market to take to one of the city beaches.

Palma can be gloriously warm and sunny even in early spring and autumn.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>AFTERNOON</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is an excellent network of cycle lanes, making cycling an easy and enjoyable way to explore.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">A kite (the bird variety) circles high above the chimney tops, as a cock pheasant walks daintily across the gravel drive. The evening sun floods the honeyed front of the Grade I-listed Elizabethan manor house; a few guests are inspecting the walled kitchen gardens, a father pushes his daughter on the swing. Everyone seems thrilled to be here.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Certainly, we are. Bagging a room at any of The Pig hotels is an achievement at this time of year. We’ve done it by choosing a Monday and kick ourselves for not arriving at lunch rather than tea-time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It would have given us more time to revel in The Pig at Combe’s thrilling position on a hill, set in 3,500 acres of lush Devon countryside with stupendous views towards Cornwall.</p><img id="i-66efaef83a253927" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/09/4C9DB7AB00000578-0-image-a-1_1527324933756.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The Pig in Combe (above) is a Grade I-listed manor house set in 3,500 acres of countryside" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">We could have enjoyed a snack in the garden folly or a massage in one of the potting sheds. Never mind. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We settle down in our room at the top of the house and share a pot of Earl Grey tea and a slice of walnut cake, while, with the help of the directory, I regale my wife with some history.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Combe House, as it was called before Robin Hutson (who founded and sold on the Hotel du Vin chain) got his hands on it, was once owned by Bishop Odo, William the Conqueror’s half brother. From 1614 to 1846, it passed down to no fewer than 11 different members of the Putt family and then to five generations of Markers.</p><img id="i-102ee539bc273cf3" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/17/4CBB0C2F00000578-5774173-image-a-66_1527609715075.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Combe House was once owned by Bishop Odo, William the Conqueror’s half brother" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Love went into it then and love goes into it now. All The Pig’s shabby-chic trademarks (faded rugs, battered picture frames, squidgy sofas, baths in the bedrooms) are writ large and it’s fair to say that this rapidly expanding chain has redefined the country house hotel concept. The only worry is that it is now a chain.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Does one really want to turn the dining room of a Grade I-listed house into a garden centre?’ says my wife, staring at The Pig’s ubiquitous watering cans on shelves and potted herbs on tables.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She has a point. I make mine by noting that the use of the word pig and its many derivatives (‘Little Piglets’ for the children’s menu etc) is getting a wee bit tiresome and that it’s a shame to see a gift case of Pig wines loitering with commercial intent next to the check-out desk. Inevitable perhaps as the brand grows bigger and bigger but it’s still a pity.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-d2092b80-60ba-11e8-bbb3-45baf381da69">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TRAVEL FACTS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">The Pig at Combe, Gittisham, Devon, EX14 3AD.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">On the final evening of our three-day cultural tour of Valencia, dolled up and festive, we went for a slap up dinner at the swish Marina Beach Club.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Clearly the club is a place to see and be seen. This great barn of an upmarket seaside restaurant was packed with beautiful young Valencian nouveau riche shouting happily at each other.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The noise was incredible.

When I meekly asked for a knife and fork, she threw them on the table. They bounced. Twice. We couldn’t get a drink.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the waitress begrudgingly shoved a bottle of wine on the table, the wrong one, we passed a glass between us pretending it was the Holy Grail.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But were we downhearted? Not a bit. After 72 hours of sightseeing, we were stuffed to satisfied surfeit with Valencian art and culture. We had seen everything — and what a thrill it all was.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’d been to the Chapel of the Santo Caliz in Valencia Cathedral and gawped at the actual Holy Grail. We’d visited the late medieval Lonja de la Seda, or Silk Exchange, a masterpiece of civil Gothic architecture. Under shade trees outside the Silk Exchange, we’d watched traditional Valencian dancing. We’d eaten tapas at the Colon covered market, a landmark of Art Deco architecture.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’d visited the Bombas Gens Centre D’art, an old water pump manufacturer with an Art Deco facade converted to a gallery with 1,500 works of modern art by 150 artists, including Robert Mapplethorpe.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Bombas Gens’s incongruous transformation from heavy industrial workshop to bourgeois art space nicely typified the gift-wrapping of Valencian cultural and historical heritage for the young 21st-century tourist.</p><img id="i-67583f4cf83b9604" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/10/4CA3D6D200000578-5774109-image-a-11_1527327088944.jpg" height="384" width="306" alt="Paella is Valencia's most famous meal" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">We’d even been taken on a guided walking tour of Valencia’s rather unremarkable, council-maintained graffiti. Afterwards, we were privileged to meet foremost Valencian street artist Vinz Feel Free.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Wearing a tracksuit top and jogging pants, Mr Feel Free personally conducted us around his new exhibition at the Carmen arts centre, a palatial former convent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Had recognition, respectability and paid employment softened the poacher turned gamekeeper’s Leftist credo? His giant prints and photographs of nude pelota players with superimposed animal heads said an emphatic no.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We visited the Silk Museum and learned about the laborious silk making process from mulberry tree to silk moth cocoon to weaving loom to museum gift shop tat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And at the Museum of Fine Arts, a spokesman for the Valencian tourist board, solemn with excitement, confided to us that the city’s hidebound conservative council had been slung out, and a Left-wing one elected in its place.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He had a dream of bright sunlit ideological uplands dotted with costly, consciousness-raising public art. The public art we’d already seen was of startling banality. God loves a trier. We nodded approvingly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The river Turia once flowed through the centre of Valencia. In 1957, it naughtily overflowed its banks. As a punishment it was diverted away from the city centre and the river bed was planted with public gardens. The old bridges remain; the gardens and embankments have been sown with public art and post modern architectural statements such as Valencia’s ambitious new opera house.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Designed by celebrity architect Santiago Calatrava, the Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia is his homage to the homicidal sci-fi creature in Alien. As well as the Turia Gardens, Valencia has dozens of green spaces, including two botanical gardens, the Monforte gardens, the magnificent parks Glorieta, Cabecera, Alameda and Viveros.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the latter, we sat in a packed grandstand and were tortured for an hour and a half by the vibrant Armenian-Lebanese electric violinist Ara Malikian playing maniacal covers of Led Zeppelin and David Bowie.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Valencia is home of paella and where Spanish women still waft air over themselves with elaborate fans. In September, fighting bulls are run through the streets. Taxis are relatively cheap and there is a metro.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We stayed at the Sercotel Sorolla Palace hotel, ideal for the budget traveller. I didn’t realise it was a cheap hotel until I made it to breakfast one day and saw that the room was full of ordinary Valencians. If you go in July, you’ll need a parasol and fan. And for crying out loud avoid the Marina Beach Club.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-c1829df0-60b5-11e8-ad61-39d36084ba88">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TRAVEL FACTS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ryanair (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://ryanair.com/">ryanair.com</a>) flies from Stansted to Valencia from £57 return.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">If you thought that when you crossed the North Atlantic on an airliner that you were, reassuringly, a blip on a radar screen somewhere, then we’ve got news for you – you’re not.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Radar stations in the UK and North America have ranges of roughly 250 miles, so for a great deal of the journey, no one can see your aircraft.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So just how are the thousands of planes that make this voyage daily marshalled safely? It’s a system known as the North Atlantic Tracks – like motorway lanes at 38,000ft and it relies on pilots updating controllers with their position.<strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Scroll down for video </strong></p><img id="i-d2496106050eceda" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/14/4C9E78B500000578-5771567-Planes_flying_across_the_Atlantic_follow_high_altitude_lanes_kno-m-49_1527253646269.jpg" height="366" width="634" alt="Nats amazing: Planes flying across the Atlantic follow high altitude lanes, know as the North Atlantic Tracks (pictured). These tracks are monitored jointly by Canadian and UK air traffic controllers" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Here we explain how it works and how a new satellite tracking system is going to revolutionise journeys between North America and the UK - it may even help prevent tragedies like MH370.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The airspace over the North Atlantic is heavily used with up to 2,500 airliners soaring across it every 24 hours – and 2017 saw a record 500,000 flights crossing this area.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">But for four or five hours every single one of these planes is off-radar as they cross two vast tracts of oceanic airspace – Shanwick Oceanic Control Area, which is 700,000 square miles, and Gander OCA. The former is mainly controlled by the Nats station in Prestwick, Scotland, and the latter by Nav Canada.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The reason that there’s no radar coverage for these areas is simple – there just isn’t any land on which to build radar stations.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nats stressed to MailOnline Travel, however, that the planes are most certainly being monitored all the same, but this is done by position reports made every few minutes by on-board aircraft computers sending data communications and crew members using high-frequency radio. On the Shanwick side these radio communications are mainly handled in Shannon by the Irish Aviation Authority, with Prestwick handling the data links.</p><img id="i-c57d9c8c205bae70" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/14/4C9E78AC00000578-0-Around_700_000_square_miles_of_airspace_over_the_Atlantic_is_con-a-29_1527253386758.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Around 700,000 square miles of airspace over the Atlantic is controlled by the Nats station in Prestwick, Scotland (pictured)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">To make sure that the planes are safely separated, as well as using these reports, all the flights are organised into strict, pre-determined tracks – the aforementioned <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://nats.aero/blog/2014/06/north-atlantic-skies-gateway-europe/">North Atlantic Tracks</a>.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nats told MailOnline Travel that there are normally five going east and five going west – but that it can be up to 14.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They change each day to try and take advantage of the Jet Stream, which predominantly flows west to east at up to 150mph at between 30,000 feet and 40,000 feet, according to Nats.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Because of the lack of radar coverage aircraft have to be kept much further apart than when they’re over land.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nats said: ‘In radar airspace there is either a five nautical mile or three nautical mile minimum separation laterally between aircraft, however, over the North Atlantic it is 60nm laterally and for aircraft following on the same route it is based on time – essentially 10 minutes apart. For aircraft crossing another aircraft at the same level it is increased further to 15 minutes.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And aircraft are given fixed speeds to make sure they don’t catch up with the plane in front.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The tracks are set up after requests for preferred routeings are received from airlines.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nats positions them according to winds, costs and airspace restrictions and labels them from ‘alpha’ upwards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Carriers must then follow the track structure.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, a revolution is about to take place that will mark one of the biggest transformations in transatlantic flight in decades.</p><img id="i-e83daa09fe40678c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/14/4C9E78BC00000578-0-Nats_told_MailOnline_Travel_that_there_are_normally_five_tracks_-a-33_1527253524864.jpg" height="365" width="634" alt="Nats told MailOnline Travel that there are normally five tracks going east and five going west – but that it can be up to 14" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nats announced last week that it has invested in a US company called Aireon, which will use a network of 66 satellites to provide real-time global air traffic surveillance for the first time ever, including over the oceans, deserts and mountain ranges.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Five satellites for this system – known as <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nats.aero/static/the-race-to-space/">Space Based ADS-B</a> - went up with this week’s SpaceX launch and the last of the satellite constellation is set to launch in late 2018.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With annual transatlantic flight numbers expected to hit 800,000 by 2030, this system is very much needed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nats said: 'Using this data provides instantaneous updates on flight progress and in doing so, can deliver a quantum leap in capacity and service performance, making flying safer, cheaper, greener and more predictable. Not only does it allow for an increase in capacity, it allows shorter notice changes to flight planning, the use of more efficient routes, flight levels and variable speeds, all of which translates into fuel and emissions savings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Around 80 per cent of traffic will be able to fly without speed restriction, compared with the fixed speed environment operated today. Providing airlines with their requested and most efficient flight trajectories and allowing them to fly without speed restrictions correlates directly with fuel savings for airlines and emissions savings for the industry.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘We’re currently consulting with the airlines about bringing this into service over the Atlantic from 2019.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nats added that this system might also make disasters like MH370 less likely.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Although it does rely on planes broadcasting their position to the satellites, so a security risk would still be present. </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Radar stations in the UK and North America have ranges of roughly 250 miles, so aircraft don't appear as blips on a screen anyway for much of their transatlantic flight.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ted Thornhill</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-05-26T10:49:58.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>How planes are guided across the Atlantic, which is out of radar range</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-05-26T10:49:58.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5771087/FBI-issues-warnings-help-prevent-sexual-assault-planes.html" title="Keep the arm rest down and don't mix alcohol with sleeping tablets: FBI issues advice to help prevent sexual assault on planes - and it's revealed some victims are as young as EIGHT"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5770941/Adventure-hungry-couple-spend-15k-transforming-Ford-Transit-slick-home-wheels.html" title="The ad-VAN-tages of life on the road!

A boat? Croatia? I hadn’t been back there since a TV challenge in the 1990s, after the civil war. We had rebuilt a school in Pakrac. Serb fighters trained guns on us while we worked under UN protection.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We all wrote letters home in case we were shot. Yes, time to move on. I booked flights quickly, accidentally pressing the wrong button so we are flying back to Luton.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We arrived in Dubrovnik to be met by a boat the size of a hamlet. No wonder the price had made me faint. This was 85ft of gleaming mahogany, five double en suite bedrooms. We all blushed slightly as we met the four crew members, lined up on the gang plank.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dubrovnik looked stunning, yellow light sloping on to the limestone streets buffed like shiny marble. We found a tiny slit in the thick ramparts to climb through to the Buza Bar, clinging dramatically to the cliff. Music, cold beer, sunset.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On our return to our boat in the harbour, chef Dejan had produced a feast from his tiny galley, which was practically in my bedroom. He was the first person I saw through the beaded curtain first thing and last thing every day, slicing, frying. All quite bonding.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">After setting sail from Dubrovnik, our first stop was Mljet National Park. We moored off an exquisite bay and swam before lunch. We were still in the early stages of our relationship with the crew, who spoke little English, so our ‘snack’ for lunch was a three-course feast.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It had been impossible filling out the online meal preference form before the trip. How to accommodate all our fads with a cross in a box, including Girlfriend 1’s ‘definitely vegetarian but wouldn’t say no to meat juices’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The National Park was written about by Homer in The Odyssey. Apostle Paul visited the island on his way to Rome. Their directions were better than ours. We set off along a pine-fringed pathway hugging a lake. We could see the Benedictine monastery on an island but how to get to it? </p><img id="i-1e0b11c3317ccd7b" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/16/4C5CF8D100000578-5709341-image-a-86_1526572569320.jpg" height="476" width="634" alt="Coasting along: Anneka's luxury yacht, which was 85ft of gleaming mahogany with five double en suite bedrooms" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">We came to a tiny pontoon with a red flag on a short pole. Girlfriend 1 started waving the flag hypnotically. We watched, waiting for a steam train and at least a ‘Daddy, my Daddy’. Then a tiny boat chugged towards us. It picked us up, no questions asked and dropped us on the island.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A boating family holiday is brilliant. There’s no escape, you do everything together. Wink murder was good. At one point Son 1, fully clothed, staggered to the rail and tipped dramatically into the inky black water. The crew were confused but got the hang of it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A pattern emerged. We crept up to the deck each morning to enjoy the silence. Strong coffee was waiting as we emerged from a swim. ‘Breakfast means Breakfast’ said Son 2 on Day 1 and no one ever missed it for a lie-in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Next stop was Korcula, Marco Polo’s native town, and then, on Day 4, after tackling pork cheeks for lunch, we set off to Hvar. We arrived in the Venetian town square and climbed up to the fort high above the harbour, just in time for a sunset over the battlements and Adriatic Sea. Honestly, each island is a medieval gem. Never a day went by without a rampart, a spattering of the Greeks, Romans and Venetians, a crusade, a poem and often a scene from Game Of Thrones.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Day 5 there was enough wind to fill the 30ft sails. Our skipper told us we were heading to Vis, and there was a chance to visit ‘military sights with a guide for €180’. Was something lost in translation here? This seemed steep and a tad dull. Over lunch we decided we’d hire mopeds instead. </p><img id="i-356b4bc393ac5e8a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/16/4C5CF8C700000578-5709341-image-a-88_1526572576073.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Stylish stop: Vis island, which is a popular resort in Croatia and the highlight of Anneka's holiday " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The guide book told us Vis was where Tito hid submarines hidden in rock faces. I channelled my inner Bond Girl. But doubts were forming. Everyone had a friend who’d had a motorbike accident. So in the end it was just me and Sons 2 and 3, off on our rugged adventure. We twisted up mountain roads, we searched for Tito’s grave in a cave, we meandered through vineyards. We laughed at the others’ caution.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Yes, you know what happened next. I wish I did. When I came round I was lying on the ground, boys on either side of me: ‘stay with us Mum’. I sat hunched on the dirt road, sons kissing each side of my face telling me how much they loved me. Honestly, Vis was the highlight of my holiday.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We stopped in Milna for medical supplies. This was almost a throwaway island but it was as stunning as the others, a faded Cuba, stone facades and peeling shutters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We just had time to explore Split before our fight home. The port was heaving. We fought our way through the walls of Diocletian’s Palace and clocked a man in a trilby with a sign saying ‘graduate tour’. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He drew maps of the Roman Empire and four hours later, after nearly 3,000 years, we knew everything about Croatia, as well as the perfect Venetian four-point symmetry and David Bowie’s favourite sculptor, Ivan Mestrovic. Over lunch our guide randomly gave me a bullet as a souvenir of the civil war.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And I had the perfect journalistic gift at the airport, when security found the live bullet at the bottom of my handbag and arrested me. I suddenly longed for Luton.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-5008fed0-5386-11e8-bb3a-47f96e4cb165">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TRAVEL FACTS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                            <p class="mol-para-with-font">Sail Dalmatia (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://saildalmatia.com/">saildalmatia.com</a>, 0800 124 4176) offers cruise holidays aboard a range of boats. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The ten-person gulet Eleganza costs from €12,900 per week (about £10,060pp), including yacht charter, mooring fees, port taxes and fuel. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Half board, excluding alcoholic drinks, costs from €320pp (£280) per week. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">easyJet (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://easyjet.com/">easyjet.com</a>) and Croatia Airlines (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://croatiaairlines.com/">croatiaairlines.com</a>) both fly to Split.  </p></div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The TV presenter and her family set sail from Dubrovnik on board an 85 foot yacht that came complete with five double en-suite bedrooms and four crew members to help them on their journey.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ted Thornhill</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-05-25T10:45:38.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Anneka Rice treats her family to their own luxury boat in Croatian</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-05-25T10:45:38.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5735373/Now-home-Cooker-office-desk-bed-fold-wheeling-suitcases.html" title="Take your home on-the-go!

<p class="mol-para-with-font">A holiday may well be just the ticket if you have or recently had a health problem. But if we’re talking about something serious, such as cancer or a heart complication, then the cost of travel insurance can be astronomical, and some insurers will refuse to provide cover.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The big issue is ‘pre-existing medical conditions’. Insurers define these as pretty much any illness or disease you currently have, or have had in the past, requiring medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">While that may seem very wide ranging, and more minor conditions – perhaps mild and well-controlled asthma – may not result in being quoted higher premiums, you should still declare them. Insurers can, and do, use undeclared conditions as reasons to turn down medical claims. For anyone with a pre-existing medical condition, to get the right cover at the best price, here are the key pointers.</p><img id="i-8434f952d447a6f7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/16/4C5168ED00000578-5709491-image-a-73_1526571561952.jpg" height="498" width="634" alt="Move quickly: Taking out cover long after you've booked your trip can be an expensive mistake" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Choose your destination</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you have a significant medical condition, before you book your trip find out how much the travel insurance will set you back. Even for a short visit, the cost of getting covered can run to hundreds of pounds in countries where the medical care is private and expensive, notably the USA, and where there are potentially hefty emergency travel and repatriation costs, such as the Caribbean.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Generally, cover is much cheaper in Europe. However, premiums can be dearer for trips to Spain, Malta and Cyprus, which have higher levels of privatised health care than some other European countries.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Use the EHIC</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One advantage of holidaying in Europe is the European Health Insurance Card (ehic.org.uk). Though not a substitute for travel insurance, it entitles UK residents to free or reduced-cost state healthcare when in another EU country – and Iceland, Norway and Switzerland – including pre-existing medical conditions, as long as you’re not travelling intending to obtain treatment. Let’s hope EHIC arrangements will continue after Brexit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Consider a single-trip policy</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you go abroad several times a year, normally annual, multi-trip policies are the best value. However, for those with serious pre-existing medical conditions, annual cover can be prohibitively expensive, and single-trip policies may cost less.

Any condition (other than a terminal prognosis of under six months) is covered and, unusually, the policy requires no medical screening – though your doctor needs to be happy for you to travel.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">It may be just one nation but dialects across the United States can be so different they almost sound like separate languages.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And research has revealed that slang words originating from each of the 50 states are even confusing for Americans, with 40 per cent claiming that their state has specific terms that outsiders would never understand.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The study revealed the top two slang words from every state - including, for example, ripper, bubbler and hyphy - and researchers produced an interactive quiz about them so that budding linguists can find out how many unusual American terms they really know.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Scroll down to see a table of the top two slang words from every state </strong></p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The confusion that slang terms cause for Americans was highlighted using several examples by researchers in the study, which was commissioned by PlayNJ.com and saw 2,000 people polled. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">First of all they were asked what the New Jersey term 'ripper' meant and 44 per cent said it described having a good time.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Nine per cent thought it was a type of music and some Californians did not even hazard a guess.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Only 14 per cent knew the true meaning of the word - a hotdog.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile 'hyphy' refers to a form of urban music and was coined in California.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, when researchers asked the wider US public if they had heard of the word, only 21 per cent identified it correctly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Thirty-four per cent thought it was a type of sound system and others thought it was a hotdog or another word for money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The study also shows how the origins of words are hotly disputed from state to state.</p><div class="moduleFull"></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, Rhode Islanders claim to be the first to have called a water fountain a 'bubbler', but this word was also claimed in the survey by Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Texas, and Wisconsin.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile, it should come as no surprise that the research found that 'awesome' is the most easily understood word in America, with the current slang meaning having originated in California.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Washington DC, however, used the word the most, with 75 per cent of respondents claiming to use it on a daily basis - this also contributed to Washington's status as the state using the most positive language.</p><img id="i-3fb6637a2535c578" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/09/4C8C6C7B00000578-5761177-image-a-2_1527064368286.jpg" height="556" width="962" alt="Forty per cent of Americans claim that their state has specific terms that outsiders would never understand, new research has found " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">On the other side of the coin, natives of North Dakota, Vermont and New Hampshire use the word 'awesome' little or not at all, contributing to their ranking as some of the most linguistically isolated states in the US.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the crown for the state with the most confusing language goes to Kansas, with over 72 per cent of respondents claiming that those from other states couldn't understand them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Meanwhile natives of Alaska both claimed they could identify, and correctly identified, the most words out of any state. Perhaps this shouldn't be surprising, considering that 60 per cent of those surveyed had travelled to other states beside their own, giving them a great grounding in other American dialects. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Vermont and Rhode Island were joint second place for understood words, and also had the second and third highest travel rates respectively.</p><div class="travel" id="mol-0ea1fc60-5e7d-11e8-bdb6-ad0da683134f"> <table class="mol-table" data-swipe-article="false" width="100%"> <caption class="wocc">THE TOP TWO SLANG WORDS FROM EVERY US STATE REVEALED </caption> <tbody>  <tr>   <th>State</th>    <th>Population</th>    <th>Phrase </th>    <th>Meaning</th>    <th>Phrase </th>    <th>Meaning</th>    <th></th>    <th></th>    <th></th>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>Alabama </td>    <td>4,858,979</td>    <td>Hot minute</td>    <td>A hot minute is a while, a longish amount of time.</td>    <td>A ways </td>    <td>'A ways' is any distance between ten minutes and two hours in an approximate direction.</td>    <td></td>    <td></td>    <td></td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>Alaska </td>    <td>738,432</td>    <td>Outside</td>    <td>'Outside' refers to any state outside of Alaska, except maybe Hawaii.</td>    <td>Cheechako</td>    <td> A 'cheechako' is a newcomer to Alaska and knows little about living there. </td>    <td></td>    <td></td>    <td></td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>Arizona </td>    <td>6,828,065</td>    <td>Chizhii</td>    <td>The adjective literally means something is similar in texture to firewood, and is typically used to refer to rough or dry skin.</td>    <td>Carry out </td>    <td>'Carry out' is having someone carry purchases to your car from the local grocery store.</td>    <td></td>    <td></td>    <td></td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>Arkansas </td>    <td>2,978,204</td>    <td>Arkansas Tooth pick</td>    <td>An Arkansas tooth pick is a big knife.</td>    <td>Roofer</td>    <td>A 'roofer' is someone who displays traits of idiocy</td>    <td></td>    <td></td>    <td></td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>California </td>    <td>39,144,818</td>    <td>Hella</td>    <td>'Hella' is mostly another word for 'very', this Cali slang is now mainstream.</td>    <td>Bomb</td>    <td>If you really like something, it's 'bomb'.</td>    <td></td>    <td></td>    <td></td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>Colorado </td>    <td>5,456,574</td>    <td>Gaper</td>    <td>'Gaper' is a derogatory term for a novice skier.</td>    <td>14er</td>    <td> A 14er is a mountain that boasts an elevation of at least 14,000 feet</td>    <td></td>    <td></td>    <td></td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>Connecticut </td>    <td>3,590,886</td>    <td>Mystic </td>    <td>Mystic is the town of Mystic, also home of the Mystic Pizza restaurant that inspired Julia Roberts first movie.</td>    <td>Apizza</td>    <td>'Apizza' is the New Haven version of the traditional pizza.</td>    <td></td>    <td></td>    <td></td>   </tr>  <tr>   <td>Delaware </td>    <td>945,934</td>    <td>Baggin' Up</td>    <td>'Bagging up' is  laughing.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Can big also be beautiful? I’ll answer that one later, but first a few handy holiday facts. The five-star Princesa Yaiza in Lanzarote is certainly big – it has 350 rooms, six pools, eight restaurants, an excellent spa, a hair salon, a gym, countless bars, a theatre and even a shopping mall.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It commands a stunning location in Playa Blanca on the southern tip of Lanzarote, and is just a few steps from the sands of Dorada Beach and the cooling waters of the Atlantic. In many ways, it is a green oasis amid the island’s black, volcanic landscape.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We soon settled into a family routine at the hotel: my wife Suzie would head to the gym or one of the many exercise classes, our daughter Sophie, 12, would go to one of the pools to meet up with other youngsters she had quickly befriended, while I would enjoy the delights of the excellent buffet breakfast, then take to a sunlounger with a decent book for the rest of the day.</p><img id="i-15d87b6243c3e1be" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/11/4C6B05BF00000578-0-image-a-32_1526726836011.jpg" height="362" width="634" alt="Prime location: The Princesa Yaiza resort is located in Playa Blanca on Lanzarote's south coast" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Food is always an important part of a Nichol holiday and we spread our net far and wide. The hotel’s Japanese restaurant, Kampai, provided both excellent food and stunning theatre, as the chefs juggled with razor-sharp knives, catapulted prawns directly into your mouth, and created volcanic explosions with the delicious ingredients.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Restaurants along the Playa Blanca promenade were a bit more hit and miss, with many catering to those who prefer typical English fare rather than authentic Spanish cuisine. After kissing a few frogs, we found two princes where we became regulars. The Dorada Night beach bar was right outside the hotel and offered simple but truly fabulous food at extremely competitive prices.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After dinner and a few chilled beers, it was not unknown to step from our table on to the beach and enjoy a refreshing dip in the ocean.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">We also frequented Ninen, an Italian restaurant with just six tables – the home-made pasta was wonderful and the sauces and fillings were top-notch.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After our sumptuous dinners and glass of wine or three, I would usually find a comfortable chair to relax in at the hotel’s packed theatre, where the dedicated entertainment staff would put on some extremely good shows.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As on old rocker, I particularly enjoyed Queen’s We Will Rock You, but Suzie and Sophie voted Mamma Mia! their favourite. My dad-dancing in the aisles with all and sundry to Dancing Queen was a source of untold embarrassment for Sophie.</p><img id="i-da8938483ff7f689" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/11/4C6B057700000578-0-image-a-33_1526726844568.jpg" height="357" width="634" alt=" It's a hit: John, Suzie and Sophie in Lanzarote. The family particularly enjoyed the resort's Japanese restaurant and John's wife and daughter were impressed with the spa facilities " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">We also burned off some calories by exploring the Timanfaya National Park, with its Montanas del Fuego (Mountains of Fire) created in about 1730 when more than 100 volcanoes erupted, devastating the southern part of the island. Luckily, the last eruptions were nearly 200 years ago.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The temperature just a few inches below the surface is 100C, and by the time you get down to about 40ft it has reached 600C. It’s more than hot enough to cause mini-eruptions if a jug of water is thrown in, or to cook food – both of which the local guides were eager to demonstrate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Suzie and Sophie were more than impressed by the hotel spa facilities, where they enjoyed massages, facials and other somewhat mysterious treatments the ladies in my life seem to gravitate towards.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And they were both truly delighted by the hair-care treatments, geared towards helping sun-damaged hair, on offer at the salon, which they voted excellent value for money.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So back to the question I posed earlier: can big also be beautiful? Most certainly yes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">When we stayed at Princesa Yaiza, it was at near capacity, with about 1,200 guests, but the hotel is so vast that there was never any sense of crowding or having to wait at a restaurant or bar.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And with its prime location and excellent facilities, coupled with Lanzarote’s excellent year-round climate, it really is a brilliant place for a family holiday.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-89993d40-5b51-11e8-8dd8-65af000d168d">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TRAVEL FACTS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Ryanair (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://ryanair.com/">ryanair.com</a>) offers flights to Lanzarote from several UK airports, with one-way fares starting at £24.99.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Inspiring Travel Company (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://inspiringtravelcompany.co.uk/">inspiringtravelcompany.co.uk</a>, 01244 355527) offers seven nights’ B&amp;B at Princesa Yaiza from £939pp, including return flights and private transfers.</p>                            </div>                        </div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Author John Nichol kicked back with his family at the five-star Princesa Yaiza in Playa Blanca.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">In February 1979, instead of attending a recording at <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/bbc/index.html" id="mol-3bb9fb00-5075-11e8-87c6-1f9d1052b1ce">BBC</a> Television Centre, I travelled by Laker Skytrain to Los Angeles. I had to give the BBC tickets to my next-door neighbour Gerry, who gratefully seized the chance to watch the recording of Fawlty Towers’ The Psychiatrist.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Every time I see this episode, arguably the best of the lot (‘I’m a pediatrician.’ ‘Feet?’ ‘Children.’ ‘Oh. Basil!’ ‘Children have feet, don’t they? That’s how they move around, my dear’), I hear Gerry’s Welsh seal bark of a laugh – a painful reminder of one of the great missed events of my life. It’s hard to see TV Centre without a pang of regret – even harder now that this magnificent building has been sold off for redevelopment.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">TV Centre has become – what else in <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-3bbb81a0-5075-11e8-87c6-1f9d1052b1ce">London</a>? – luxury flats. The twist is that part of the building also contains a Wood Lane outpost of the Soho House empire (complete with cool club, smart hotel and rooftop pool). This hotel, it could be said, literally stands on the remains of Basil Fawlty – and so offers a sitting target to any unhappy guest with a point to make.</p><img id="i-a09ab25e2692a884" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/05/15/4BDA7CC800000578-0-image-a-87_1525528871822.jpg" height="475" width="634" alt="Outpost: The rooftop pool (above) at the newly opened Wood Lane addition to the Soho House group" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">When Soho House was launched 23 years ago, it ushered in a new era of affordable style and elegance, setting a trend that has been copied everywhere from airlines to cruise ships.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Which isn’t to say, however, that everything is perfect. We were shown to a room cold enough to satisfy a polar bear.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">British tourists arriving in Majorca and Ibiza face a May Day shock if they haven't done their homework as the doubled tourist tax comes into operation today.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And to add to their woes, the overall charge for their stay on the holiday islands will also see VAT added at 10 per cent after Madrid ruled it wanted some of the proceeds from the so-called sustainable tourism tax.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The new rates for the increased tourist tax will apply from May 1st until October 31st for all those over the age of 16.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hoteliers have already warned that the extra fee will make the islands less attractive to visitors who will seek out bargains elsewhere, particularly with the resurgence of destinations such as Tunisia or Egypt. They believe up to a million holidaymakers could be lost.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Majorca and the rest of the islands will lose competitiveness as a holiday destination with respect to Turkey, Egypt or Tunisia, which will devalue their currencies to be much more attractive for German and British tourism,' says president of the Hotel Federation of Majorca, Gabriel Llobera.</p><img id="i-98e27b648ebcc9b1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/12/4BBB70E500000578-5678017-image-a-3_1525173352363.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="The Balearic Government says the tax will still be 'the lowest in Europe' compared to Brussels (average cost of eight euros), Florence (five euros) and Amsterdam (three euros)" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, the Balearic Government has told the Association of British Travel Agents that the 'sustainable tourism tax' only represents between 1.4 to 2.1 per cent of the daily expenditure of tourists visiting the islands and the revenue, around 120 million euros in 2018, is being ploughed back into environmental projects.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The controversial tax was reintroduced in 2016 and tourism chiefs point out that it was set at the same level as when first charged but later dropped in 2011.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They have written to both Abta and Germany's equivalent, the DRV in defence of the charge to explain how the money is being spent, including on upgrading sewage treatment and water plants.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The number of visitors coming to the Balearic Islands continues to rise year after year and this generates greater environmental impacts,' says the Balearic tourism department. 'The revenues of the tax are primarily invested in environmental protection projects in order to substantially reduce these impacts and preserve our territory.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The doubling of the tourist tax from May 1st will mean guests staying in hotels, city hotels, five-star apartment hotels, five-star luxury and four-star superiors will pay four euros per day; those of four stars and three stars superior, three euros; those of one, two and three stars, two euros.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As for tourist apartments, holidaymakers staying in four keys and four upper keys will pay four euros per day; three keys upper, three euros; one, two and three keys, two euros.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In rural hotels, it will be two euros per day; in hostels, hostels residences, pensions, inns, tourist camps and campsites, as well as shelters, it will be two euros.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The tax decreases by 50 per cent on the ninth night of a holidaymaker's stay.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For the first time, the Government will also charge cruise ship passengers if they stop at a port in the Balearic Islands regardless of the berth time - up to now it was only charged after 12 hours. The fee will be two euros and this alone is estimated to generate revenue of about 1.8 million euros.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Balearic Government says the tax will still be 'the lowest in Europe' compared to Brussels (average cost of eight euros), Florence (five euros) and Amsterdam (three euros). </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>This summer will also be the first time cruise ship passengers will be subject to the charge as part of the Balearic's bid to bring in millions of euros of extra income.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ted Thornhill</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-05-02T01:52:22.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Tourist tax in Majorca and Ibiza DOUBLES from today</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-05-02T01:52:22.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5677473/Meet-Emirates-flight-attendant-setting-Instagram-alight.html" title="Meet the stunning Emirates flight attendant who is setting Instagram alight with mesmerising photographs of her globe-trotting lifestyle "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5677765/Timelapse-footage-shows-British-Airways-A380-flying-Heathrow-San-Francisco-FOUR-MINUTES.html" title="Stunning timelapse footage shows a pilot's-eye-view of a British Airways A380 flight from Heathrow to San Francisco that takes just FOUR MINUTES"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5674339/Hilarious-picture-captures-seal-appears-brutal-hangover.html" title="Flippin' 'eck my head hurts!

Monty became the main presenter on Gardeners' World in 2003, and since 2011 the show has been broadcast from his own garden, Longmeadow, in Herefordshire. For his most recent series, Monty Don's Paradise Gardens, he discovered more about the tulip and its sacred significance in Turkey.

The selection includes a heart-melting shot of a mother polar bear swimming along with her two cubs in tow, an incredible snap of a leopard trying to catch a stork (main), a mesmerising capture of a lizard hiding behind a leaf (inset) and a baby black-tip reef shark swimming through a shoal of fish in the Maldives.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ted Thornhill</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-04-30T08:10:18.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Jaw-dropping National Geographic nature photographs</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-04-30T08:10:18.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://natgeo.com/travelphotocontest" title="2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year | National Geographic"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.instagram.com/natgeotravel/?hl=en" title="National Geographic Travel (@natgeotravel) • Instagram photos and videos"></link></item><item><title>French is 'world's best nationality' according to index that ranks countries on economic strength and business-growing potential, with the UK 13th and America 27th</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5639439/Study-ranks-French-worlds-best-nationality.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Apr 2018 16:34:47 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5639439</guid><description><![CDATA[It is top of the Henley & Partners – Kochenov Quality of Nationality Index, which ranks nationalities based on economic strength, human development, peace and stability.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Some nationalities are radically better than others: being born French gives one a huge advantage over the liability brought about by a Somalian nationality, for example. With the QNI, illustrating this discrepancy becomes simple.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Secondly, the QNI proves that it is not true that the most prosperous and economically important countries endow their citizens with the best nationalities: while China is an economic giant, its nationality has a very modest objective value, and while Liechtenstein has a micro-economy compared to that of China, its nationality is world-leading. Some nationalities are great, while others are quite simply terrible.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Renowned revellers, Romans need little excuse to kick up their heels and celebrate with a lively fiesta, parade or street party. As a year-round city break destination, visitors to the Eternal City will always find something going on. We’ve collated a selection of Rome’s notable festivals and events over the next year.</p><img id="i-bfccb52c980e5662" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/09/17/4AFBFA6000000578-5594737-image-a-1_1523289905826.jpg" height="488" width="634" alt="The ultimate insider's guide to the best Rome has to offer" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Winter</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Carnevale di Roma is a big deal in Rome. While it doesn’t quite match the popularity and exuberance of the Venice Carnevale, Rome’s annual Mardi Gras brings a wave of colour and celebration to the Eternal City. Promising a week of colourful processions, street parties, music concerts and fireworks displays, Carnevale is largely centred around Piazza del Popolo. But make sure you don't miss the magical candle-lit race down Via del Corso which happens the night before Lent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Carnevale di Roma: </strong>3 February¬–9 March 2018</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Spring</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Easter is one of the busiest times to visit Rome when thousands flock to the city. Probably the biggest event in the Roman Catholic calendar, the city celebrates the four-day event with great aplomb. At the centre of the celebrations is the Pope’s Easter address on Easter Sunday in St. Peter’s Square. As a kind of post-celebration unwind, La Pasquetta, also known as little Easter, is celebrated on Easter Monday, when Romans traditionally retire to the many city parks for big communal picnics with families and friends.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Easter celebrations: </strong>30 March–April 2018</p><img id="i-6d93b7410b114cb4" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/09/17/4AFBFA5800000578-5594737-image-a-2_1523289934969.jpg" height="421" width="634" alt="Once in a lifetime: Celebrate Easter with the Pope at St. Peter¿s Square in Rome" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another big date in the city’s spring calendar is the Maratona di Roma, one of Europe’s most popular marathons. Runners from all over the world descend on the city for the annual race, which starts at the Colosseum and winds for 26 miles past Rome’s most iconic landmarks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Maratona di Roma: </strong>8 April 2018.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another major date in Rome’s annual calendar is the city’s birthday. Founded in April 753 BCE, Rome celebrates Natale di Roma on 21 April each year. Although the majority of festivities, street parades, parties and fireworks displays are centred around the Campidoglio and the Capitoline districts, the city also hosts a series of live gladiatorial re-enactments at the Colosseum.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">La Notte die Musei is the annual late-night museum festival is held in late May when Rome's major museums and galleries throw open their doors for after-hours access. Almost 90 of the city’s art galleries, museums, libraries and academies stay open until 0200, many hosting an array of art and music performances, guided tours and expert talks.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Summer</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Once a year, the nation comes together to celebrate Festa della Repubblica, Italy’s Independence Day. Italians congregate in their home towns and cities to take part in big street parades, lively parties and fireworks displays all across the country. In Rome, the main procession is held on Via dei Fori Imperiali, and is followed by a massive music concert in Quirinale Gardens.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Festa della Repubblic:</strong> 2 June 2018</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In July, head to the Travestere district for the legendary <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://fave.co/2pHpndv">Festa de' Noantri</a>, the city's ancient religious festival which dates back to the 16th century. The main event kicks off with a procession held in honour of the Madonna del Carmine. An elaborated dressed statue of the Madonna is paraded through the streets of Travestere to reside at the church for the duration of the festival.

Go-to producers would be Schloss Lieser, JJ Prum, Egon Muller amongst many others. If you like the lightness of Riesling but in the dry style, you must go to Australia, with the best regions being the Clare and Eden Valleys.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Alsace is the go-to for full-bodied Riesling that are complex and dry to off-dry.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Sauvignon Blanc</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The safe choice for those who like semi-aromatic, lively, dry light and crisp whites. The best bets are Loire Valley in France if you like a bit of “greenness” in your wine (e.g. grassy and herbal notes),  but also a great feel of minerality. Sancerre and Pouilly Fume are at the top of the pyramid in terms of quality and prices but my cheaper version of this delicious grape would come from Quincy, the oldest white wine appellation of France.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Pinot Noir</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It grows widely but it is really difficult to find better expressions than in Burgundy, France.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Off the beaten track - Oregon, Sonoma Coast, Russian River, Santa Rita in the US, Central Otago in New Zealand and there are some extremely good value Pinot Noirs coming out of South Africa, some serious wines made in Chile nowadays and those made in the South Argentina part of Patagonia are also terrific.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Chardonnay</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Go for the birthplace of Chardonnay! Burgundies are always the most enticing, complex, well balanced, pleasant and long lived of the family. Meursault, Chassagne and Puligny Montrachet are where the best are probably produced (and their Grand Crus).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Go to South America for fruitier, richer styles. In the mid of the range I would suggest South Africa.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Dry crisp whites</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Those wines are created worldwide and to find good ones isn’t that hard. I would drink Gruner Veltliners from Austria, especially Steinfeder and Federspiel. The Provencal in France are well made from the Vermentino grape as well as the ones in the north of Italy, especially in Alto Adige and Friuli Venezia Giulia.

It’s then a 15-minute walk south along Avenida Jorge before you hit the beach, and another 10-minute stroll east to A Pastorinha.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2F9JBpb">Delmare Café</a></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you want to experience one of Lisbon’s legendary sunset summer parties, put <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2F9JBpb">Delmare Café</a> on your evening agenda. Another Costa de Caparica haunt, it turns into a party place after dark that strives to mirror the cool all-night bars of Ibiza. Spread over multiple areas, cosy seating areas on the sand are ideal for lounging around with friends while the DJ area is ideal if you’re feeling energetic. In the high season, it often stays open until 1600 making it an all-night destination. The bar is open Sunday–Thursday 0900–0200, Friday–Saturday 0900–0400.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Getting there: Cross over the 25th April Bridge out of the centre. Get on the A38 eastbound and take the third exit onto the A33. After 3.5km, take the exit towards Feijo and then the first exit on the roundabout. At the next roundabout, turn onto the N377 and continue to the N377-2. As the road becomes parallel to the coastline, you’ll see an unnamed road; Delmare Café is at the end of it on the right-hand side.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"> </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>From exploring its maze of cobblestone streets and sampling delicious pastel de nata to sunning yourself on one of its many nearby beaches, Lisbon is the perfect spot for a summer getaway.

Touring the secret annexe where the Franks concealed themselves from the Nazis and where Anne wrote her diary is a moving experience.

It is one of the quaintest of Amsterdam’s brown cafes (the Dutch version of a British pub) and comes with the added bonus of a canalside terrace.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For supper, why not take a tram to trendy Foodhallen (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://foodhallen.nl/">foodhallen.nl</a>) in the Oud-West district. The former tram depot is packed with gastro food stalls serving Dutch and ethnic dishes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>DAY TWO</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Morning</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The major art galleries are on Museumplein.

Reopened a few years ago after a decade-long renovation, it is like a combined version of our National Gallery and V&amp;A, and is dauntingly large. Focus on the Old Masters in the Gallery of Honour and Rembrandt’s masterpiece in the Night Watch Gallery, then seek out the 17th Century dolls’ houses.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To avoid artistic overload, leave for another time the modern-focused Stedelijk, the Museumplein’s third big gallery. Instead, jump on a tram to the train station, walk through to the back of the station, then hop on the free ferry marked Buiksloterweg and make the three-minute journey across the IJ river to the up-and-coming Amsterdam-Noord district.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>Afternoon</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Stroll over to the EYE, the futuristic, zigzag-shaped film museum building.

With flat terrain and bike lanes everywhere, cycling can be a joy, at least beyond the busy centre.

The journey, which will be on Eurostar’s latest e320 trains, is likely to be more relaxing than flying, with more comfortable seats and no restrictions on luggage. In Amsterdam, you arrive at Centraal Station, within walking distance of many hotels.</p><img id="i-1fb7c98db0324486" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/24/11/4965B87C00000578-5429947-image-a-14_1519473565761.jpg" height="391" width="586" alt="The journey from London to Netherlands' capital takes three hours 41 minutes, with services twice daily in the week" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How frequent will the services be?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Initially twice a day on weekdays, departing St Pancras at 8.31am and 5.31pm, and once a day at weekends – the morning service on Saturdays and the evening one on Sundays. But services will become more frequent.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>What are the complications on the return leg?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The UK and Dutch governments haven’t sorted arrangements for checking passports before boarding Eurostars in Amsterdam (and Rotterdam). Until they do – and they have promised to do so by the end of 2019 – you can’t travel direct with Eurostar back to London. Instead, you’re advised to take a Thalys from Amsterdam to Brussels, then change to a Eurostar for the Brussels-London leg. However, connections are good – the total journey time is four hours 40 minutes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How much will tickets cost?</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">From £35 one-way (outbound) or £78 return. With so few trains to start, I suspect seats will fill up very fast, so book well ahead to secure the cheapest fares.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">EasyJet, which has 21 flights a day from London to Amsterdam, has fares from £30 one-way, without a checked-in bag.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://eurostar.com/" title="This link is invalid, and will be stripped on publish"></a><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://eurostar.com/" title="This link is invalid, and will be stripped on publish">eurostar.com</a></p>                            </div>                        </div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>As Eurostar launches its new direct service from London to Amsterdam, The Mail on Sunday's Fred Mawer reveals his 48-hour guide to exploring the city.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Despite what you might have heard, it’s easy to avoid the tourist traps and eat cheaply in Venice. You can expect three-course meals for less than £20 a head and decent wine by the litre, if you know where to go.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Top tip: lots of Venice’s best restaurants are small, and Venetians are big on booking ahead, so if there’s somewhere you really want to eat, don’t risk just turning up on the night – make a reservation at least a week in advance.</p><img id="i-5c6a8c24db51b502" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/21/17/4971463F00000578-5417703-image-a-1_1519234762985.jpg" height="951" width="634" alt="You're in for a treat with our lovely list of the best cheap eats In the Floating City" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2CaO1eK">La Zucca</a></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Simple, authentic Venetian food that leans towards vegetarian awaits at <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2CaO1eK">La Zucca</a>, which means ‘pumpkin’ in Italian. The namesake veggie appears frequently on the menu – the pumpkin flan is a restaurant signature that keeps the locals coming back for more – alongside other satisfying dishes, such as zucchini and almond lasagne and burrata with aubergine. If you’re travelling with carnivorous friends, dishes like roasted rabbit and crispy duck with apples will keep them occupied. Expect to pay around £50 for a couple of courses and a bottle of house wine. Santa Croce 1762, 1762, 30135</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2BGDCGq">Osteria Antico Giardinetto</a></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2BGDCGq">Osteria Antico Giardinetto</a> is a cosy, rustic family run restaurant that’s well known for its seafood and friendly service. It’s not necessarily cheap but you get a lot of bang for your buck. Large platters are piled high with crab, prawns, mussels, and squid, and pasta dishes come swirled with fresh asparagus and pumpkin, or more fish. To finish, you won’t regret ordering the chocolate mousse, which has been on the menu for almost as long as the restaurant has been open. Calle dei Morti, 2253, 30135 Santa Croce</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2BF313k">Da Mamo</a></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you’re in Venice for the pizza, head to <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2BF313k">Da Mamo</a>. The queue of locals outside every evening is testament to just how good its light and crisp pizzas are, and the long list of toppings is sure to have something that appeals to everyone in your group. Portion sizes are very generous, but if you’ve got room, the tiramisu is excellent. Even better, it’s really budget friendly – pizzas start at just £6.50 each. A lot of restaurants in Venice ask that you pop in or call to reserve a table, but you can book online. Calle dei Stagneri O de la Fava, 5251, 30124</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2CaMDbM">Il Paradiso Perduto</a></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Looking for somewhere a bit more lively? Head to <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2CaMDbM">Il Paradiso Perduto</a>. It’s always crowded and full of long tables that mean it’s hard not to make friends, plus there’s a live jazz singer most weekends. For a quick and easy bite between tourist activities, order small plates and finger food at the counter, and at dinnertime, take a seat and enjoy unfussy Venetian dishes with a bottle of wine. Bring cash – debit and credit cards are no good here. Fondamenta Misericordia, 2540, 30100 Cannaregio</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2BIObcf">CoVino</a></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You’ll feel like you’re in your own private dining room at <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2BIObcf">CoVino</a>, a subtly stylish eatery in the neighbourhood of Castello. The kitchen and restaurant are all in one room, and the latter comprises just seven small tables and exposed brick walls with shelves full of bottles and jars. The menu is concise and inspired by seasonality so it’s ever-changing, and three courses will set your back around £36. You can expect thoughtfully arranged plates of meat and fish with crisp toppings and pureed vegetables on the side, but the portions aren’t stingy, and nothing is prettified for the sake of it, as well as traditional pasta with a twist. An evening at CoVino is a real experience, and you can expect attention and guidance from the owner Andrea Lorenzon himself, who is always more than happy to help you select wine pairings from his extensive list.

As you might have already inferred from the name, La Tecia Vegana is a vegan restaurant, and a great value one, too. Nothing on the menu costs more than £6, and though the décor is humble, the service is excellent, and you’ll be pleasantly surprised by your meal’s presentation. Most of the ingredients are organic, and lots of them are inspired by global cuisine – ideal if you’re looking for a bit of a change after a week of pasta and pizza. Dorsoduro, 2104, 30123</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2BH7JgN">Al Merca</a></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Not in the mood for a big meal?

Ask the friendly staff to keep plates of bite-size antipasti, cured meats with sweet fruits, and crusty bread with olives (for the budget-friendly price of £1.50 a pop) coming, while you sip an Aperol Spritz by the bar, or on the canal side steps just a few steps away.

It remains popular with locals and visitors alike, and is a great place to try classics like Bratwurst, Boulette (a kind of meatball) and, of course, currywurst, which comes in the classic pork but also vegan varieties. <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://fave.co/2CXR4Ud">Konnopke’s</a> is open Monday to Friday 1000–2000, and on Saturdays 1130–2000.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>U-Bahn: Eberswalder Straße</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong><strong>Mustafa’s</strong></strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kebabs may be on offer all over the city, but not all kebabs are created equal. Arguably the best in Berlin are the chicken kebabs from Mustafa’s in Kreuzberg, where it is not uncommon to see a long queue at any time of the day or night. The imbiss, located on Mehringdamm, is open Sunday to Thursday 1000-0200, and Friday and Saturday 1000–0500.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>U-Bahn: Mehringdamm</strong></p><div>

One of them is Eurostar's Business Premier offering, which while it isn't a lavish hotel-on-wheels like the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express or Belmond British Pullman, is still something special (even if the occasional passenger sees fit to eject etiquette and drape their legs over their table).</p><img id="i-20836080327ef99e" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/30/15/48BBA48600000578-0-image-a-4_1517324640635.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Ted travelled with his family on Eurostar's new e320 train from London to Paris, Business Premier" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-61ba1eda0a019d1" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/30/15/48BBA47100000578-0-image-a-7_1517324645196.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="Business Premier carriages offer passengers more space, bigger seats and UK and continental power points at every seat" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Granted, Eurostar can hardly get away with throwing out carriages designed for standing room only on services to Paris, but I say it's hats/berets off to it for laying on an option that harks back to the golden age of train travel.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I tried it on a trip to Paris with my girlfriend and six-month-old baby daughter recently and matters became 'Premier' the moment we checked in (which if we'd wanted to, could have been just 10 minutes before departure).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Staff beamed at us and coo-cooed at the baby as they examined our tickets, then we moved through a dedicated security lane (where the officials were still reassuringly no-nonsense) and trundled into the Business Premier lounge.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We were greeted like old friends and shown to one of the few spare seats available by a member of staff who then fetched us croissants and coffees.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another member of staff, noting the baby and the potential for disruption, kindly moved our seats on the train to a carriage where we were guaranteed a table for four with no one opposite.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Then he grabbed as many of our bags as he could and showed us to the door of our carriage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You certainly don't get that on the 17.56 to Beckenham Junction via Tulse Hill.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Our train was one of the new e320s, and while I'm not a massive fan of its slightly antiseptic lighting and panelling, the seats in Business Premier are fantastic - definitely big, definitely comfy.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">The Mediterranean city of Valencia has an astounding cathedral, brilliant beaches, renaissance churches, some of the most striking modern architecture in Europe, fabulous sea food and gutsy red wine. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The locals are intensely proud of their city, culture and language, a form of Catalan called Valencian. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">They might not shout about it as loudly as the Barcelonians, but perhaps that's because their city is - whisper it - even better than Barcelona.</p><img id="i-e99f084d10aa6932" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/12/15/480EC5D800000578-5263351-image-a-1_1515771793996.jpg" height="389" width="634" alt="Come and discover: Valencia is a fascinating city - as intriguing as better-known Barcelona" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Who needs the whorls of Gaudi's Sagrada Familia when you've got the spiralled columns of the city's gothic Silk Exchange? Even paella was invented here.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>RIVER LIFE</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After the River Turia flooded disastrously in 1957, the government diverted its waters. Now the wide green riverbed snakes through the city, providing 9km of parkland and a home for the Ciudad de las Artes y las Ciencias, an eruption of futuristic pavilions, lakes, an Imax cinema, aquarium and botanic gardens.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">All of this is overlooked by the tallest opera house in the world, Santiago Calatrava's steel and concrete Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia, an ancient Greek helmet-shaped building.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Take a glass of wine on the breeze-cooled palm terrace before the opera or come back on Friday evening when music students from the nearby Berklee College of Music give free concerts on a floating stage in the lake (April to October).</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>SACRED PLACES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Valencia cathedral and the Micalet bell tower are must-sees, but be sure to look up when you are inside the cathedral.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The windows are filled with inch-thin alabaster instead of glass. This makes for a spectral interior rendered even more eerie by the presence of Francisco Goya's 1788 painting St Francis Borgia At The Deathbed Of An Impenitent, where a figure of Christ on the crucifix spurts blood on to a sinner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Step into the cathedral's Holy Grail chapel, home to a revered silver chalice which, as it dates to the 1st century AD, might just be the real thing.</p><img id="i-37d1f92082ef9a30" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/12/15/480EC5F100000578-5263351-image-a-2_1515771835009.jpg" height="426" width="634" alt="Making waves: The city also offers easy access to some of Spain's loveliest beaches" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>MASTERPIECES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You'll find modern art at the Institut Valencia d'Art Modern (El Ivam) and El Greco paintings at the El Patriarca museum.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>ON THE TILES</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The city is famous for its ceramics and tiles, a tradition that dates back to the long years of Moorish rule. But you'll also find Picasso's work at The National Museum of Ceramics in Ciutat Vella, housed in a baroque palazzo with the most famous decorated doorway in Spain.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Go to the marvellous antiguedades shop on Corretgeria street, where there are tiles in geometric patterns, or line drawings of doves from the 19th century and earlier.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>FIRE WATER</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After taking in the Napoleonic-era shell marks in the ancient masonry of the Ciutat Vella's Porta de Serrans, have a restorative pitcher of Agua de Valencia. The madly baroque Cafe de las Horas (Comte d'Almodovar street) serves this super-charged drink with cava and spirits. There are also non-alcoholic cocktails. And cake!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>HIT THE BEACH</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Like Barcelona, Valencia has a famous city shoreline, but you'll find fewer people on Malvarrosa Beach, a 15-minute bus or tram ride from the city centre.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Casa Carmela, set back from the Malvarrosa Beach, is the place for paella. Locals favour the rabbit offal, snails and chicken paella cooked on open fire pits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>TRAIN STATION </strong><strong>SPOT</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Take a morning cafe solo in the Estacion Del Norte, one of Europe's best-preserved art nouveau railway stations, and marvel at the ceramic fruits hanging from columns and tile murals.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One hundred years old last year, Estacion Del Norte stands like a north African fort beside the city's brick bullring.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>TUCK IN</strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There has been a resurgence in local cuisine, with new takes on staples like hake and pork.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Mercat de Colom is a gastronomic destination with restaurants including Habitual, run by Michelin-starred chef Ricard Camarena.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the Ruzafa quarter, the enthusiastic staff of 2 Estaciones serve tuna with peanuts, muscatel, lime and watermelon and Valencian wine to make it zing (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="http://www.2estaciones.com/">2estaciones.com</a>). </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-680815e0-f7ae-11e7-97b7-0d865e5e2250">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TRAVEL FACTS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">easyJet (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="http://www.easyjet.com/">easyjet.com</a>) flies to Valencia from £41 return.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Rooms at Melia Plaza hotel (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="http://www.melia.com/">melia.com</a>) cost from £81.</p></div>                        </div>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Barcelona tends to take all the popular plaudits when it comes to Spanish cities which also have beaches.

</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">There is a post-Christmas calm in the air, as if the great city is pausing and drawing breath in preparation for the year ahead.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The sales, however, are in full cry and there are great deals to be found, and not only at flagship department stores such as Bloomingdale’s (Third Avenue at 56th Street), Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman (754 Fifth Avenue), and Barneys (66 Madison Avenue for the main store and 101 7th Avenue for the downtown store). </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">You will also discover bargains in the upmarket Madison Avenue boutiques (Elie Saab, Tom Ford, Ralph Lauren and the rest) and in the downtown cut-price emporiums such as Century 21 (21 Cortlandt Street), where you could easily unearth a Gucci, Prada or Dolce &amp; Gabbana gem for just 20 per cent of the listed price.</p><img id="i-83037d3d9cf96378" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/23/10/47897F9900000578-0-image-a-10_1514026181136.jpg" height="446" width="634" alt="Sale shopping is in full cry and there are great deals to be found, and not only at flagship department stores such as Bloomingdale’s, pictured " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">I first stayed at the Pierre because of its proximity to the Fifth Avenue department stores and the Madison Avenue boutiques. But it is much more than location. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This is one of New York’s grand dame hotels – Elizabeth Taylor had a private apartment here in the day and the famous tango scene from the Al Pacino film Scent of a Woman was filmed here – and still has a glamorous feel about it. The main restaurant, Perrine, an art deco space that serves French-American cuisine on Central Park, remains one of the best hotel restaurants in the city. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, back to the shopping.   </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">New York-based Gail Heimann, a self-confessed inveterate shopper, says that although shopping’s centre of gravity has shifted to online transactions, there is still a great deal to be said for visiting New York’s department stores in person. She says they’re the first destinations for her British friends.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘British travellers who are looking for iconic brands at dramatically reduced prices can still find them at stores such as Bergdorfs, Barneys and Saks,’ she says.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘And for people who want to loll around their hotel room and don’t want to get out of whatever high-end pyjamas they are wearing, they can set themselves up with a NYC address for a few days.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Net-a-Porter delivers within five hours and so do the others such as Moda Operandi and Rue La La for women and Bonobos and Mr Porter for men.</p><img id="i-d423402670ad11a2" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/23/10/4789885600000578-0-image-a-11_1514026253269.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Shoppers walking through the streets of midtown Manhattan. But it’s not just shopping and sales that make January the go-to month to visit" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘They also pick up returns the next day if the ordered item doesn’t fit.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But it’s not just shopping and sales that make January the go-to month to visit. Transatlantic air fares are discounted – British Airways, which operates 82 flights a week between London and New York, offers a sale price of £386 return based on a seven-night stay, compared with the standard £426. And Manhattan hotels also offer deep discounts and special packages in January.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The other bargain involves Manhattan’s normally eye-wateringly expensive shows. Broadway Week, which actually runs from January 16 to February 4, comes with a range of two-for-one ticket deals for many of the major shows that a month earlier were sold out at premium prices.</p><img id="i-243c921c0a3d7763" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/23/10/47897FE100000578-0-image-a-13_1514026265642.jpg" height="442" width="306" alt="Hotel 50 Bowery has a great rooftop bar and is a five minute walk from Little Italy, pictured " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">In December you would expect to pay more than $1,000 (£745) from brokers for tickets for popular shows such as Hamilton, Dear Evan Hansen, Hello Dolly! with Bette Midler, and The Parisian Woman starring Uma Thurman – that’s three or four times the face value.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">If you are lucky, these shows will be included in the Broadway Week offers for 2018, although Bette Midler leaves Hello Dolly! on January 14, to be replaced by Bernadette Peters.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">There are more than 8,000 restaurants in Manhattan, and whereas in December you’re lucky to get a table at the best ones, in January you can often stroll in without a reservation. Many of these will be offering incentives to draw in more customers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For all the sales, deals and price incentives, the main reason to visit New York is, well, it’s New York – the world’s most exciting and vibrant city, a heady mix of history, urban legend, wild enthusiasms and dark pleasures.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It is one of those cities where you feel you can reach out and touch its cultural, historic reference points. When I first visited Manhattan in the 1970s, I would walk into the Midtown jazz clubs and listen to legends such as Roy Eldridge playing in half-empty rooms.</p><img id="i-703c22d22d4e15f6" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/23/10/47897FDD00000578-0-image-a-15_1514026280567.jpg" height="406" width="634" alt="Tickets for Hello Dolly! with Bette Midler are being included in Broadway Week 2018 " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today legends are still playing at the Village Vanguard in the West Village, or the Blue Note and Minton’s in Harlem, but now the rooms are full of European travellers connecting to that marvellous musical tradition that is distinctly New York. Benny Goodman may be long gone but his spirit lives on in these clubs and streets.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Finally, on a recent trip I stayed way downtown for the first time in years (at Hotel 50 Bowery, right in the middle of Chinatown) and I thoroughly recommend it. The views of the city from the rooftop bar are second to none, the cocktails are superb, and you are a five-minute walk from Little Italy, where you will find the best pasta restaurant in Manhattan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Aunt Jake’s (151 Mulberry Street) is superb – and even if you’re not staying downtown, it is still worth the journey.</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-02e2e440-e7cf-11e7-af66-431f6cba35bb">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TRAVEL FACTS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">America As You Like It (<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="http://americaasyoulikeit.com/">americaasyoulikeit.com</a>, 020 8742 8299) offers four nights in New York from £1,514pp at the Pierre or from £802pp at the Hotel 50 Bowery.

There simply isn’t anything that looks like you’re on a normal aircraft except the windows, of which there are two.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Another benefit is that the A380 is an incredibly quiet aircraft, but even more so on this specific jet as it features the latest generation side-wall panel lining and insulation to reduce noise, making the suite pretty silent, too.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The suites features, he revealed, are ‘amazing’.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He continued: ‘There are so many amazing features. Firstly, the entire suite is controlled by a tablet, which adjusts the lights, TV position, movies and more – including the seat.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it’s the seat that he says is one of the stars of the first-class show.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: ‘It’s more like a plush armchair – it swivels, turns a full 180 degrees. This meant that I could face the TV screen in a comfortable position, or use the button to turn a little more – and use the dining table to “dine in the sky”.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It also meant that I could turn all the way around to face the windows. This for me was the most unique and best feature of the new suite.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It meant that once I closed the suite door, I turned the seat to face the windows, dimmed all of the lights and watched the sun set over the Middle East. We were cruising at 38,000ft, the sunset was incredible, and I was able to watch it all from the comfort of the seat in the suite, actually facing the windows. For me, it was the best inflight entertainment that no TV-screen would have ever been able to achieve.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It’s two thumbs up, as well, for the layout of the suites from Macheras.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: ‘The suites are designed in a way in which the dividing wall - between the front two suites on each side - can be lowered, to create a double suite, essentially like a hotel with interconnecting rooms.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So did he have any criticisms? Actually, yes.</p><img id="i-674066225303220d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/18/17/476DD6D200000578-5191577-The_suite_had_almost_no_negative_aspects_for_Macheras_save_for_a-a-17_1513619401503.jpg" height="639" width="962" alt="The suite had almost no negative aspects for Macheras, save for a lack of individual air vents" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: ‘There are no individual air vents to regulate the temperature of your suite - this is because there are no individual air vents anywhere on the aircraft. Instead, the aircraft is controlled in climate zones by the cabin crew, with air emerging from the vents in the ceiling/upper side wall panels of the aircraft.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘This meant that while I was asleep, it was a little too warm for my liking, but the crew turned down the temperature without any problem.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">As you can imagine, the suites aren’t cheap, but they’re worth the outlay, Macheras concluded.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: ‘This is first class – so it’s never going to be cheap. Return first-class suite fares from London to Sydney, via Singapore, cost from £9,500 – which is in line with other airlines’ first-class pricing, except this new product is now the best in the world.’</p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-bf947010-e412-11e7-8f97-cd43a52ccc12">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">MACHERAS REVEALS THE DELIGHTS OF BEING ON BOARD THE A380 DELIVERY FLIGHT </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">As an aviation analyst, Macheras is often invited on board delivery flights.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And this one – for the new A380, which features a redesigned interior to make space for the luxury cabins - was one of the most memorable for him.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: ‘Our delivery was from Airbus HQ in Toulouse, South of France – to the new home of Singapore Airlines’ latest jet, Singapore Changi Airport.</p><img id="i-a6e8995af6c68ce7" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/18/16/476DD6C600000578-5191577-image-a-51_1513615515532.jpg" height="480" width="914" alt="Macheras flew on the delivery flight of the A380 from Toulouse, pictured, to its home at Changi Airport in Singapore" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘Our flight time was approximately 12 hours, and this was a performance flight, and a private flight – as we were transporting the plane from manufacturer, Airbus, to customer, Singapore Airlines.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘After a celebratory party at the Delivery Centre - the private terminal where we depart from - I boarded at around 12 noon to continue the celebrations onboard, and deliver this stunning new jet to Singapore.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘The aircraft would be virtually empty, meaning I was often wandering around the largest commercial aircraft in the skies while not seeing a single other person for quite some time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘It’s a surreal feeling, but it also means I get to know the cabin products very well, testing all seat features, cabin interior elements and more.</p><img id="i-d090d978ecc6c4d" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/18/17/476DD68E00000578-5191577-Empty_Macheras_was_able_to_wander_around_the_brand_new_A380_cabi-a-18_1513619418396.jpg" height="686" width="914" alt="Empty: Macheras was able to wander around the brand new A380 cabin" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">‘During the flight I could often be found underneath a row of seats in economy class measuring the legroom of certain seats, as some seats offer more legroom than others, or I was in one of the suites, drinking champagne with the team and controlling the lights in my suite using a wireless tablet.’</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He was also able to have a word with the pilots.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He said: 'It was a "performance" flight, meaning the flight crew were always monitoring how the aircraft reacted to different phases of the flight.

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Ship workers have been revealing exactly what happens behind the scenes on a cruise liner.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it appears that crew members having 'so much sex', T-shirts being flushed down the toilet and elderly people dying are among the things passengers on board never get to know about.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The revelations emerged on an online discussion that was sparked after an internet user asked for cruise liner secrets to be spilled.<br /></p><img id="i-776ed780db168e45" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/29/10/46CD0C3900000578-5128191-image-a-1_1511953020880.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Cruise ship workers have been revealing what goes on behind the scenes " class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font"><a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7g5m1j/cruise_ship_employees_of_reddit_what_are_things/">Reddit</a> user willfulpool posed the question: 'Cruise ship employees, what are things that happen aboard the ship that the guests don’t know about?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He got hundreds of responses, many from former cruise workers, who lifted the lid on life on the seven seas.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">Several mentioned the cramped sleeping quarters that staff on board are forced to live in.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One commenter, stylz168, wrote: 'Was on a cruise recently and struck up a conversation with one of the performing artists from a show.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'He told me how cramped the sleeping quarters were for the crew, and basically created to be shared spaces.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'So if he wanted to have sex with his wife, he would have to schedule it around the other two people who shared the space.'</p><img id="i-387bd5ed4dd8189a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/29/10/46CD0C4900000578-5128191-image-a-2_1511953037864.jpg" height="423" width="634" alt="Many mentioned that the staff quarters were very cramped and many crew members would have sex, with an STD rate that is 'through the roof'" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">While PhantomSplit added: 'If you think that you don't have much space in your room then you should see the crew's quarters. The crew is packed in like corn on a cob.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Take that single person room you have, double the size, but now six people are sleeping and living in there.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And it seems that as the staff in the cramped areas get very close, many also get intimate.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">OptimalGoat added: 'Oh man are the crew all having sex with each other. Just... all the time.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You work with like, 20 other people in your department, all in this little prison of a job for six months at a time, except every few weeks two to three of the people might just be swapped out to other people.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">PhantomSplit added: 'The crew has so much sex. There was a place in the main crew area with free (sh****) condoms but the STD rate is still through the roof. Well over 50 per cent. It honestly amazes me how much sex everyone has when everyone is also sharing rooms. But most employees will be on the ship eight months out of the year and all that pent up tension will get released one way or another.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Elderly passengers passing away on board was also brought up with many former cruise workers saying it is more common than people think.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One revealed: 'A family friend use to work for a cruise line and told me deaths are common, especially with the elderly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Senior/nursing homes are expensive and for a much smaller price tag the elderly can be gone for a week or two at a time and have people constantly checking on them and they get all their meals.'</p><img id="i-71b5d4365d8fbc9c" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/29/10/46CD0C3D00000578-5128191-image-a-3_1511953050052.jpg" height="410" width="634" alt="Sailing the vessel under a flag of convenience and even elderly passengers dying can also take place right under holidaymakers' noses" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">And Notmiefault added: 'I did a behind-the-scenes tour of a cruise ship once and they showed us the morgue.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'They also have two full ICUs on board since, even with helicopters, it can be days between someone falling ill and getting them to a proper hospital.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">PhantomSplit, who claimed he used to work in the engine room of a cruise liner, unveiled more about life on the open waves, including how companies circumnavigate employment rights, what customers flush down toilets and how smokers held up the refuelling process.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He explained: 'The one thing to realise is that most cruise ships sail under a "flag of convenience".</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'This means that they register the ship under some country that has some really relaxed regulations. For you the customer this probably does not mean much. But for employees this is important because it means there are not always strict regulations on how you get paid or competitive wages.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He continued: 'You would be amazed at what people will flush down the toilet. Pool noodles, T-shirts, shoes... pretty much anything that people don't want to pack with them when they leave.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'The ship also needs to fuel up (bunkering) and sometimes passengers are on board while that is going on. No open flames are allowed outside while bunkering is ongoing and this becomes a problem with passengers who need a smoke.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'To get around this they smoke in their rooms, which sets off the smoke detectors. There is also a regulation that bunkering must immediately stop if a fire alarm goes off until the hazard of a fire has passed. So somebody from the crew has to go to your room and make sure it isn't on fire. Then they call down to the engine room to report it's a false alarm. Then we can start the pumps again. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'On average, bunkering is usually interrupted three or four times due to this and it's annoying as hell.' </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Crew members having 'so much sex' and elderly people dying are among the things passengers on board never get to know about according to an online discussion on U.S-based Reddit.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ted Thornhill</dc:creator><dc:modified>2017-11-29T18:47:00.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Cruise workers reveal things that passengers NEVER get to know about </mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2017-11-29T18:47:00.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Reddit</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5124571/Why-plane-passengers-disembark-left-hand-side.html" title="Revealed: Why passengers enter and exit the plane via the doors on the left-hand side"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5113579/Cruise-liners-BOYCOTT-Majorca-Ibiza.html" title="Cruise liners may BOYCOTT Majorca and Ibiza unless Balearic government changes its mind about two-euro-a day-charge for passengers"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5095531/The-ships-recreate-golden-age-ocean-liners.html" title="The cruise ships that best recreate the romance and glamour of the golden age of ocean liners"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5124571/Why-plane-passengers-disembark-left-hand-side.html" title="Revealed: Why passengers enter and exit the plane via the doors on the left-hand side"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-5121319/Travellers-reveal-managed-board-wrong-flight.html" title="'I didn't realise anything was wrong until we started descending way too early!'

To get a taste of the great outdoors head to Camp Wilderness. The venue runs safari-style two, three and five-day bushcraft camps in private woodlands for ‘tribes’ of children aged six to 15. Cornbury Park in Oxfordshire and Cholmondeley Castle in Cheshire are the most atmospheric of the four venues. Children sleep in large bell tents and relish taking risks (after lessons in First Aid, and how to safely light fires and whittle with knives). The field cook prepares all meals outdoors, while children have fun building shelters and swimming in lakes. Many come back year after year, drawn by the cosy night-time story-telling, toasting marshmallows and drinking hot chocolate round the campfire.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>Daily Mail</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Sadie Whitelocks</dc:creator><dc:modified>2017-07-25T15:18:20.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Summer camp champs: Pack the children off America-style</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2017-07-25T15:18:20.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Family,Active</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-4566308/Can-guess-stunning-beach-landscapes-are.html" title="Can YOU guess where these stunning coastal landscapes are?

It is all hand-painted wallpaper, sumptuous sofas and bathrooms with more marble than the Taj Mahal.</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The comforts of the hotel are such that when Depp stayed in the luxurious Bernadotte Suite earlier last year, he did what most guests do: stayed in and ordered room service.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After staying at the Grand, I can hardly blame him for opting for breakfast, and everything else, in bed.</p><img id="i-b91624f244ab61eb" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/29/16/40EA562100000578-4545196-image-a-13_1496071285783.jpg" height="641" width="962" alt="The Veranda Restaurant is one of the most glamorous spots to eat in the city" class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-c993202963bd6b98" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/29/16/40EA562E00000578-4545196-image-a-15_1496071294466.jpg" height="642" width="962" alt="The comforts of the hotel are such that when Depp stayed in the luxurious Bernadotte Suite earlier last year, he did what most guests do: stayed in and ordered room service" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">When the hotel opened in 1874, it was the first in Europe to change its sheets between guests. While other establishments might have caught up on this front, the Grand’s beds are still sumptuous, velvet-headboarded extravaganzas vast enough to accommodate a groupie or five.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With only my husband for company in my King Size, I dragged myself downstairs and out into the biting wind which whipped around the beautiful quayside on which the hotel stands. We quickly discovered that our London clothes were inadequate when it came to fending off the icy Nordic weather. Togged up in every jumper, scarf and jacket we owned, we were also lagging pitifully behind the Swedes in the style stakes. Even local toddlers, kitted out in brightly coloured Polarn o Pyret snowsuits, looked more fashionable.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The good news? Less than a five minute walk away there are armfuls of brands like Acne, Ganni and Fjallraven to be had. And the bad? You’ll need to sell your left kidney to afford more than a couple of items. Wandering around a Moroccan bazaar, scooping up a bargainous bounty to take home, this is not.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A little warmer and a few hundred pounds lighter, we wandered towards the galleries and vintage shops of nearby Sodermalm. Anointed the coolest neighbourhood in Europe by Vogue, no less, the area seemed eerily similar to parts of London's Shoreditch,</p><img id="i-469f3c9f2b92a9db" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/29/16/40EA565C00000578-4545196-image-a-19_1496071318688.jpg" height="722" width="962" alt="Johnny Depp and his entourage were seen drinking in the Grand bar in the early hours of the morning " class="blkBorder img-share" /><img id="i-7753169f84ceed0f" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/29/16/40EA563A00000578-4545196-image-a-17_1496071307723.jpg" height="722" width="962" alt="Fancy a dip in style? The Grand has you covered, with its enticing, moodily lit pool" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">We Brits have swallowed Swedish style wholesale, with the result that Stockholm now feels strangely familiar – all man buns, beards and people working on Mac books in cafes. But what cafes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The Swedes take their coffee very seriously, and make simple, perfect cups. Forget endless matcha-chai-soy-almond milk-wet-dry-skinny options (I was even rebuffed when trying to order a decaf). The Swedes simply do Good Coffee, with cake. Always with cake. The tradition - known as ‘Fika’ in Sweden – usually involves tucking into a fluffy, sticky cinnamon bun sprinkled with cardamom seeds.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Luckily a walk around the vintage clothes shops, a trip to the Vasa museum – which tells the story of a warship which, like a Swedish Mary Rose, sank just moments after leaving Stockholm harbour on its maiden voyage – and the city’s impressive modern art museum was enough to work up an appetite before dinner at the hotel.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Run by chef Mathias Dalgren, the hotel has as many Michelin stars as it does restaurants – three. We plumped for the Veranda restaurant, which is known for its smorgasbord.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The country’s most famous culinary export after Ikea’s meatballs, the smorgasbord is – like everything else in Sweden – a superior version of the British equivalent: the buffet.</p><img id="i-fd25739411ea728a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/30/16/40EA564500000578-4545196-The_terrace_at_the_Grand_is_one_of_the_places_to_be_seen_in_Stoc-a-5_1496157625301.jpg" height="642" width="962" alt="The terrace at the Grand is one of the places to be seen in Stockholm and features natty striped furniture" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">The heaving tables are also approached in a far more civilised fashion than those endured in British hotels, with foods eaten strictly in order, and a clean plate for each course.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We tried to set about the spread in restrained Scandinavian style, but while my blonde, bearded husband may have been mistaken for a native in the street, once armed with a plate there was no disguising his greedy Anglo-Saxon heritage.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We tucked into five different types of herring, gravlax, hot and cold smoked salmon, soups, charcuterie, meatballs with ligonberry jam and a huge array of desserts, all washed down with the hotel’s homemade 1874 Aquavit.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Of course the Grand is used to catering to far more exalted guests than us. The banquet for the first Nobel Prize was held there in 1901, and the winners and their families still stay at the hotel every year. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The pairing seems apt – for while the Grand may not have cracked world peace or a cure for cancer, staff have got hosting a decadent city break down to a fine art.  </p><div class="art-ins mol-factbox travel" data-version="2" id="mol-5438a950-4217-11e7-829b-3d940e3d1744">                            <h3 class="mol-factbox-title">TRAVEL FACTS </h3>                            <div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body">                                <p class="mol-para-with-font">Rates for a Superior Water View Double room (the smallest room) for two persons including breakfast is SEK6,000 (£535).

For example (bottom right), massively up your chances of bagging an empty plane seat between you and a companion by booking the window and the aisle seat. No-one picks the middle one, so if the flight isn't full, it's likely to stay empty. Even if not, the middle passenger will probably swap with you.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Ted Thornhill</dc:creator><dc:modified>2017-05-23T05:59:25.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Are these the best life hacks EVER?</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2017-05-23T05:59:25.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-4529646/Magaluf-mutes-music-s-louder-vacuum-cleaner.html" title="The party is over!

<p class="mol-para-with-font">You know those places that lay on trendy ‘city beaches’ by dumping fake sand by the river as if they’re Rio or Miami?</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I think of Paris and London (who lay on such metropolitan riparian amenities when the mercury rises) with fresh pity.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">For this comes to you from Cascais, a mere 30 minutes from Portugal’s capital city, Lisbon, and yards from the following: groomed beaches the consistency and colour of powdered shortbread, where olive-skinned lovelies are – to use the technical term that seems right for once in this 27C April Iberian sunshine – skimpily ‘romping’ with a volleyball; a world-class museum quarter including an institution devoted to Portuguese artist Paula Rego; a fish market where today’s pearlescent sea creatures are being weighed and then slapped into a trundling conveyor belt of trays ready to be sold.</p><img id="i-f00fc8e9967d1147" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/20/12/40909B4F00000578-0-image-m-27_1495280057661.jpg" height="735" width="634" alt="Tucking in: Rachel enjoys a lazy lunch in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, one of Europe's famed foodie havans" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hold on, I’m not finished! I’m also yards from several top fish restaurants, and later tonight I will toddle in my flip-flops to O Pescador and have the grilled fish platter – but only after I’ve stuck a card into a slot and piped a chilled Esporao from Alentejo into a waiting wine glass in the high-tech wine bar at the Villa Cascais guesthouse.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Why don’t all wine bars have the same help-yourself system? I really hope it catches on.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">I’ve never been to a destination that genuinely has it all in such close proximity: beach, culture, city, ‘the nature’, and nightlife (although my idea of a good time is being in bed with my book by midnight, so go elsewhere for the best fado dives/nightspots).</p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">I am just half an hour from Sintra, Estoril and Lisbon, so it’s possible to cram in many of the sights in a short time. In Sintra we took a tuk-tuk up the steep cobbled lanes to the dramatic Castle of the Moors, a storybook edifice on a crag that stares across to a real bake-off romantic showstopper called the Pena Palace.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">After you’ve done the castle and palace, wander around and have a glass or two of vino and some tapas. You’ve earned it.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In Estoril, I flopped on the beach, swam, and drove past the famous casino, keeping my powder dry for the main event: Lisbon, the happening foodie capital of Europe. </p><img id="i-d91abc1847c0b59a" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/20/12/40909B6600000578-0-image-a-28_1495280159510.jpg" height="373" width="634" alt="Cascais (pictured), a mere 30 minutes from Lisbon, boasts everything from beaches and markets to museums and great restaurants" class="blkBorder img-share" /><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lisbon is also hilly and reminded me of San Francisco thanks to its trams and hipsters. Indeed, it is so hip and trendy that Hollywood actor John Malkovich has opened a restaurant, Bica do Sapato, on the docks in Santa Engracia.</p><div class="mol-article-quote nochannel floatRHS" id="mol-7ecba4d0-3d51-11e7-8226-51b33d4920dc">                            <div class="mol-article-quote-wrapper ccox">I’ve never been to a destination that genuinely has it all in such close proximity </div>                        </div><p class="mol-para-with-font">We also headed to the Bairro Alto, where all the restaurants my foodie friends recommended seem to be located, and ate at two of them with great pleasure and gusto. But we also just drifted around taking snaps of painted trams, of blue-tiled pastelarias with their mounds of glistening custard tarts, or took cityscape pictures from the various miradouros, or viewpoints.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">We hired a car, but it’s really not that necessary as you can reach almost everything from Cascais: you can walk to Estoril, and there is a fast train to Lisbon, and connections to Sintra, but I rather enjoyed Mr Toading around with the top down in the sunshine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">So here are my top tips.
