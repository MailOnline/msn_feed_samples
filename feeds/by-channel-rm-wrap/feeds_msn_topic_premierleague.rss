The 19-year-old, who was once compared to Lionel Messi by Mauricio Pochettino, has only played two senior matches to date — a 15-minute cameo for Spurs in a 5-0 League Cup win over Gillingham in 2016 and an even shorter appearance for Norwich during a disappointing loan spell in the 2017-18 season. According to The Guardian, Tottenham still believe in the attacking midfielder's potential but the player himself is said to want immediate first-team football, which is unlikely to be on offer in the short-term in north London.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Robert Summerscales</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T10:54:30.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Marcus Edwards 'wants to leave Tottenham' two years after Messi link</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T10:54:30.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Leo Messi,Tottenham Hotspur,Premier League,Transfer News</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5809741/Tottenham-prepare-talks-Manchester-United-Anthony-Martial.html" title="Tottenham step up their pursuit of Anthony Martial as they prepare talks with Manchester United officials"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5808481/Tottenham-target-Leon-Bailey-asked-stay-Bayer-Leverkusen-season.html" title="Tottenham transfer target Leon Bailey asked to stay at Bayer Leverkusen for another season"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5807433/Lionel-Messi-Mo-Salah-join-David-Beckham-adidas-World-Cup-advert.html" title="Lionel Messi, Mohamed Salah and Paul Pogba joined by David Beckham and Jose Mourinho in star-studded adidas advert ahead of the World Cup"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5807015/Harry-Kane-Eric-Dier-stretched-shape-England-training.html" title="Harry Kane and Eric Dier among England stars stretched into shape by medical staff before training at St. George's Park ahead of the World Cup"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/06/mini-messi-marcus-edwards-seeking-exit-tottenham-hotspur-this-summer" title="‘Mini Messi’ Marcus Edwards seeking exit from Tottenham this summer | Football | The Guardian"></link></item><item><title>Transfer news LIVE: Jasper Cillessen admits interest in Premier League clubs plus all the other news, moves and updates from around Europe</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5811433/Transfer-news-LIVE-updates-moves-Europe.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jun 2018 08:01:04 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5811433</guid><description><![CDATA[The summer transfer window is open and clubs in the Premier League and across the world are looking to get deals done, particularly with the World Cup around the corner.

Brands has arrived from PSV Eindhoven to take over from Steve Walsh as Director of Football; Walsh was sacked from his £1million-per-year role last month having overseen a disastrous recruitment drive that saw Everton spend £239million on transfer fees over a 12 month period. Marco Silva, the new manager, has inherited a squad with 38 players. Many have seen their values depreciate and are on lucrative contracts - Everton's wage bill is close to 80 per cent of their turnover - and Brands is conscious that moving people on will be difficult.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Robert Cottingham</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-06T08:34:50.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Marcel Brands: Everton's wages means selling players could be tricky</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-06T08:34:50.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Premier League,Everton</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5808725/Manchester-City-Premier-League-players-World-Cup-16-two-clubs-none.html" title="Manchester City have the most Premier League players at the World Cup with 16 but two clubs have none and can you name the one Watford player who will be in Russia? "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5805473/Wayne-Rooneys-future-not-hands-admits-new-Everton-boss-Marco-Silva.html" title="Wayne Rooney's future is 'not in my hands', admits new Everton boss Marco Silva with forward on the brink of DC United move"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5804817/Trent-Alexander-Arnold-scores-cracker-England-training-debut.html" title="Trent Alexander-Arnold scores cracker in his first England training session as Liverpool teenager makes immediate impression ahead of the World Cup"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5804093/Arsenal-understood-preparing-Manchester-Uniteds-Marouane-Fellaini.html" title="Arsenal preparing move to land Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini on free transfer"></link></item><item><title>'Sometimes to stay on the bench is difficult': Willian admits frustration over Chelsea role last term but respects Antonio Conte's decision</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5810335/Willian-admits-frustration-Chelsea-bench-stints-term-respects-Antonio-Contes-decision.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jun 2018 23:53:59 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5810335</guid><description><![CDATA[12 team-mates played more minutes for Chelsea last season than Willian, despite the Brazilian winger - who is now focused on the World Cup - later being named as the Players' Player of the Year.]]></description><content:encoded></content:encoded><dc:abstract>Willian has admitted he found it frustrating to be forced to sit on the bench at Chelsea last season when he felt he was showing the best form of his career.

Toure left City at the end of the season after eight glorious years. But in his final campaign his relationship with Guardiola deteriorated and he made only one Premier League start. In an interview with a French football magazine, the 35-year-old  made the extraordinary suggestion that he was being discriminated against by Guardiola on racial grounds.

He ran out of power. When all was said and done, his legs had gone. His performance at the heart of the team's midfield in the League Cup semi-final first leg against Bristol City, six months ago, got to the heart of it. Toure laboured desperately, lasted 70 minutes and was replaced by Sergio Aguero, who scored a 90th-minute winner to rescue the team from embarrassment. Bristol City finished the season 11th in the Championship. Toure barely featured again. This is an outcome which befalls every player in the final outcome and while most accept it with good grace, grateful for what they have had, Toure's extraordinary outburst against the manager who presided over his last years is an act of narcissism. To embellish his attack on Pep Guardiola with a casually vicious claim of racism discredits those many individuals who are genuinely working to remove the scourge of discrimination from football.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Robert Summerscales</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-05T09:05:54.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>City named a training pitch after Toure but can they still love him?</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-05T09:05:54.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Premier League,Manchester City,Pep Guardiola</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sportsnews/article-5804411/Yaya-Toure-sensationally-accuses-Pep-Guardiola-favouring-white-players.html" title="Yaya Toure sensationally accuses Pep Guardiola of favouring white players, claiming: 'I want to destroy the Pep myth - us Africans aren't treated in the same way as the others'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5774871/Marseile-interested-signing-Yaya-Toure-Marouane-Fellaini-free-transfers.html" title="Marseille interested in signing Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure on free transfer and also consider move to sign Manchester United's Marouane Fellaini"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5761825/Man-City-legend-Toure-refuses-dismiss-huge-rivals-United-dont-rule-big-teams-out.html" title="Manchester City legend Yaya Toure admits he 'loves Paul Pogba' as he refuses to dismiss huge move to rivals United: 'I don't rule big teams out'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5803161/Joey-Barton-backs-Steven-Gerrard-Frank-Lampard-good-managers.html" title="'Pep Guardiola is the best coach and he played with no pace and no skills': Joey Barton backs himself, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard to be good managers because they were 'plodding midfielders'... but admits he will have to tone down Twitter use"></link></item><item><title>Roberto Firmino and Ringo Starr merge into one while Mo Salah wears John Lennon's glasses in weird Beatles artwork shared by Simon Mignolet</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5806015/Roberto-Firmino-George-Harrison-merge-one-Beatles-meme-shared-Simon-Mignolet.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jun 2018 00:25:56 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5806015</guid><description><![CDATA[The edited cover had Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson in place of Paul McCartney, while Salah wore Lennon's hair and glasses.

Yaya Toure put in a swaggering performance in a deep central midfield position for all but five minutes of the contest. It was a perfect night. The relationship between the manager, who had been a midfielder himself, and the Ivorian was not always so 'sweet'. When Guardiola promoted Sergio Busquets from the B team into the holding role, Toure found himself out of favour. Not many could complain about a midfield three of Busquets, Andres Iniesta and Xavi but Toure did. Still, he played 77 games for Guardiola, winning both the Champions League and the Copa del Rey, playing the finals as a central defender. He also left the club with two Spanish league titles.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Robert Summerscales</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-04T23:35:12.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Pep Guardiola and Yaya Toure won trophies but had tension at Barcelona</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-04T23:35:12.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Manchester City,La liga,Pep Guardiola,Barcelona,Premier League</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5805503/Man-City-named-pitch-Yaya-Toure-love-him.html" title="Manchester City named a training pitch after him... but can they still love Yaya Toure now? "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sportsnews/article-5804411/Yaya-Toure-sensationally-accuses-Pep-Guardiola-favouring-white-players.html" title="Yaya Toure sensationally accuses Pep Guardiola of favouring white players, claiming: 'I want to destroy the Pep myth - us Africans aren't treated in the same way as the others'"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5803161/Joey-Barton-backs-Steven-Gerrard-Frank-Lampard-good-managers.html" title="'Pep Guardiola is the best coach and he played with no pace and no skills': Joey Barton backs himself, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard to be good managers because they were 'plodding midfielders'... but admits he will have to tone down Twitter use"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5804387/Pep-Guardiola-handed-one-match-ban-Manchester-Citys-Champions-League-game-season.html" title="Pep Guardiola handed touchline ban for Manchester City's first Champions League game next season after he was sent off during Liverpool last-eight tie"></link></item><item><title>Premier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore has a plan to end TV money scrap after pressure from Liverpool owner John Henry</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5805385/Richard-Scudamores-plan-end-Premier-League-TV-money-row-week.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2018 21:31:52 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5805385</guid><description><![CDATA[CHARLES SALE -

So would you if you had sold 40,000 season tickets for a ground that might not exist. That’s 40,000 very unhappy customers on line one. The important date is Saturday, September 15 — the weekend after England play Switzerland on September 11. The Premier League can follow precedent and give Tottenham their first three fixtures away from home, everything before the international break on September 3. After that, it becomes problematic. Not least because Premier League rules state that wherever a club plays its first designated home match must remain its home until the end of the season.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Jonathan Spencer</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-06-01T09:52:29.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>If Spurs' ground isn't ready, their title bid could be over quickly </mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-06-01T09:52:29.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Tottenham Hotspur,Premier League</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5792381/Abramovich-great-Chelsea-smallest-Big-Six.html" title="Roman Abramovich has been a great owner... but as of now, Chelsea are the smallest of the Premier League Big Six"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5786453/Theres-rush-negative-judgement-Southgate-not-Gazza-McManaman-hes-leaving-out.html" title="MARTIN SAMUEL: There's a rush to negative judgement over Southgate and his squad but it's Shelvey and Wilshere he's leaving at home, not Gazza and McManaman"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5777489/We-remember-Gareth-Bales-goal-fifty-years-sets-Man-United.html" title="We will remember Gareth Bale's goal for next 50 years... it sets him up for a move to Manchester United, where he's already a legend for humiliating Loris Karius"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5768875/No-longer-Steven-Gerrard-Lite-Jordan-Hendersons-won-over.html" title="No longer a Steven Gerrard Lite, Jordan Henderson's won us over"></link></item><item><title>Laurent Blanc is the prime candidate for Chelsea job if search for new boss remains a struggle... after Roman Abramovich's plans for new stadium are put on hold</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5792829/Blanc-prime-candidate-Chelsea-job-Grant-running-search-boss-remains-struggle.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 May 2018 21:30:34 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5792829</guid><description><![CDATA[The future of Chelsea was shrouded in uncertainty on Thursday night after a day of stunning revelations — while Laurent Blanc emerged as a serious candidate for the managerial job.]]></description><content:encoded></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The future of Chelsea was shrouded in uncertainty on Thursday night after a day of stunning revelations — while Laurent Blanc emerged as a serious candidate for the managerial job.

The same as any Premier League team, really. Poor recruitment, poor managerial choices, poor executive decisions; there are many reasons for relegation and few signpost administrative excellence. Incompetence: that is the common denominator. That is why fortunes are often spent and wasted scrambling to survive. Queens Park Rangers had one final, costly splurge before disappearing below the surface.

The Portuguese has signed a three-year deal to succeed Sam Allardyce, believed to be worth £5million a season. He was the first choice of Farhad Moshiri, Everton’s major shareholder, when Ronald Koeman was fired after a dismal start last October, but Watford would not release Silva. Everton are still in negotiations with Watford over compensation — Silva has not worked since he was sacked in January — but those discussions have not prevented the 40-year-old taking up a position on Merseyside that he insists reflects his ambition.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>George Flood</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-05-31T23:40:43.000+01:00</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Marco Silva pledges to restore entertainment factor to Everton</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-05-31T23:40:43.000+01:00</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Everton,Premier League</media:keywords><media:content url=""><media:thumbnail url="" type=""></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5790973/Everton-set-announce-Marco-Silva-new-manager.html" title="Everton finally announce Marco Silva as new manager after controversial seven-month chase as new boss promises to make fans feel 'pride' again after dismal Sam Allardyce reign"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5787365/Everton-revive-Crystal-Palace-defender-Patrick-Van-Aanholt.html" title="Everton could revive interest in Crystal Palace defender Patrick van Aanholt despite Sam Allardyce's departure "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5783731/New-Everton-director-football-Marcel-Brands-begin-work-Friday.html" title="New Everton director of football Marcel Brands to begin work on Friday as club aims to appoint Marco Silva as manager by the end of the week"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5781471/Wales-manager-Ryan-Giggs-left-fretting-Ashley-Williams-injury.html" title="Wales manager Ryan Giggs left fretting over Ashley Williams after rib injury in goalless draw with Mexico"></link></item><item><title>Tottenham captain Hugo Lloris and Chelsea ace Olivier Giroud visit Roland Garros as France team-mates shelve club rivalries for the love of tennis</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5790289/Spurs-ace-Hugo-Lloris-Chelseas-Olivier-Giroud-visit-Roland-Garros.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 May 2018 08:53:53 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">5790289</guid><description><![CDATA[France captain Lloris and target man Giroud both wore denim as the Paris Grand Slam's dress code is much less formal than Wimbledon's.
