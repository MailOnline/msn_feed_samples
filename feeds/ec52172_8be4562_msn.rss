For years she has spoken openly about her joy in giving a cultural face to older women,' Kelly told her studio audience.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Well the truth is most older women look nothing like Fonda, who is now 80. And if Fonda really wants to have an honest discussion about older women's cultural face, then her plastic surgery is tough to ignore.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She continued: 'Fonda herself knows this. She knows this. And that is why, to her credit, she’s discussed her cosmetic surgery pretty much everywhere before coming on our show.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kelly went on to list the many outlets that Fonda has complained to along with the many outlets to which she has previously discussed her plastic surgery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today was one of them, with Lily Tomlin joking last week during an interview with Kotb and Guthrie about how long she had known Fonda by stating: 'Oh, my God…I think before your first facelift!' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fonda shot back: 'Who are you, Megyn Kelly?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the moment, all four women erupted in laughter, and the exchange was later posted on social media. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Jane Fonda had quite the response to Lily Tomlin's facelift question, read the caption. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kelly does not seem to be laughing however in the wake of that interview. </p><div class="mol-html" id="mol-8a361270-ff9c-11e7-b719-074218538f37">                            <div><div style="position:relative; padding-bottom:63%; padding-bottom:-webkit-calc(56.25% + 50px); padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 50px); height: 0;">    <iframe style="position:absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.today.com/offsite/megyn-kelly-i-have-no-regrets-about-my-question-to-jane-fonda-1142616131655" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe>  </div></div>                        </div><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Look, I gave her the chance to empower other women, young and old, on a subject which she purports to know well and she rejected it. That’s okay. But I have no regrets about the question,' explained Kelly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Nor am I in the market for a lesson from Jane Fonda on what is and is not appropriate. After all, this is a woman whose name is synonymous with outrage.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is when Kelly launched into Fox News mode. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Look at her treatment of our military during the Vietnam war, many of our veterans still call her "Hanoi Jane" thanks to her radio broadcasts which attempted to shame American troops. She posed on an anti-aircraft gun used to shoot down our pilots,' stated Kelly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'She called our POW's "hypocrites and liars" and referred to their torture as understandable. Even she had to apologize years later for that gun picture - but not for the rest of it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She then closed out by saying: 'By the way she still says she's not proud of America. So, the moral indignation is a little much. She put her plastic surgery out there. She said she wanted to discuss the plight of older women in America. And honestly she has no business lecturing anyone on what qualifies as offensive.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kelly's claim is inaccurate however, with Fonda apologizing directly to a group of Vietnam veterans in 2015 while appearing at an event in Maryland.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Whenever possible I try to sit down with vets and talk with them, because I understand and it makes me sad,' Fonda told those assembled at the Weinberg Center for Arts according to <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fredericknewspost.com/z/content_type/news_article/jane-fonda-met-with-protest-in-frederick-hopes-for-open/article_f76347a9-d99c-56d1-85a8-af1bc5432524.html">The Frederick News-Post</a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It hurts me and it will to my grave that I made a huge, huge mistake that made a lot of people think I was against the soldiers.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She later described herself as a 'lightening rod' to many, like to 50 protesters outside the venue that evening who carried signs reading: 'Forgive? Maybe. Forget?

  </video><p class="mol-para-with-font">In what looked at the time to be an ill-advised and poorly conceived move, Kelly decided to ask the actress to detail the plastic surgery she has had done over the year back in September.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You, you've been an example to everyone, on how to age beautifully and with strength. And unapologetically,' began Kelly, nervously drawing out her question.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You admit you had work done. I think it's to your credit. You look amazing. Have you ... why did you say .. I read you felt you're not proud to admit you had work done, why not?' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is when Fonda asked why they were discussing the subject.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kelly tried her best to salvage the question, with Fonda at that point glancing over to her guest Robert Redford in disbelief that she was being asked that question while out promoting the pair's new film, 'Our Souls at Night.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Well, one of the things people think about when they look at you, is how amazing you look,' said Kelly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A composed-as-ever but noticeably chilly Fonda at that point demurred: 'Thanks. Good attitude. Good posture. Take care of myself.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She then took control of the interview from Kelly by telling the host: 'Let me tell you why I love this movie that we did, "Our Souls at Night," rather than plastic surgery.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Redford then looked at his co-star and showed his support for her by laughing and saying: 'Back to that, huh.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fonda then launched into her own talk about the film, no longer waiting or wanting to take one of Kelly's questions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You kind of have a choice in life, when you get to be close to 80, or even before then, what you want to do with your life. And my character, Addie, in this movie, she knows there's a lot more time behind her than in front,' explained Fonda.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And she doesn't want to go down lonely and scared. She's been a widow, living in this house by herself. And she's lonely and scared. And she's a shy person, who is not someone who would normally do this. But she girds her loins and decides...'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Redford jumped in saying: 'That's where I come in.

As long as I've known Jane, she always has been moving forward. And doesn't look back,' said Redford.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And whatever pain, whatever problem she's had in the past, remains in the past. And she keeps moving forward. It's an admirable quality. And few people have it like Jane does.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rest of the interview was a wash, with Kelly getting no response from Fonda when she launched into a bit about how she was an aerobics instructor for 10 years shortly after the actress released her bestselling exercise tapes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And to close it all out, Fonda drove home just how little she cared for Megyn's questions and how proud she was of her looks and how she has aged when the host asked her guests: 'On behalf of our audience member, Victoria wanted to ask, if you could go back to any age in your life, what would it be? I ask that to both of you.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fonda very curtly replied: 'Right now. I wouldn't want any other time.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The actress has indeed spoken about procedures she has had done in the past, but only while promoting her fitness and wellness projects.   </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>That moment occurred during Kelly's third episode when she asked the Oscar-winner about what work she had done in the past, which prompted a steely Fonda to stare Kelly down and ask: 'We really want to talk about that now?' Since then Fonda has complained about the question to a number of outlets, and even mocked Kelly's question on Today last week during an interview with Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb 'When she first complained publicly after the program, and repeatedly, I chose to say nothing, as my general philosophy is what other people think of me is none of my business,' said Megyn at the end of her program on Monday. 'However, Fonda was at it again last week, including right here on NBC, and then again elsewhere.

Gone are the days when new signings held a club scarf over their head and simply smiled. While Paul Pogba made his entrance to a rap video with grime artist Stormzy when he rejoined the club for a record fee 18 months ago, Sanchez went the classical route as he gave a recital of ‘Glory, Glory Man United’ on the 36-second clip released by the club on social media. </dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Joe Strange</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-23T09:06:36.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Manchester United announce Alexis Sanchez signing</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-23T09:06:36.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Manchester United,Transfer News,Alexis Sanchez,Premier League,Arsenal</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/18/4877E5A400000578-0-image-a-35_1516647253313.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/18/4877DB8200000578-0-image-m-42_1516647273809.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5295419/Alexis-Sanchez-Ten-things-dont-know-him.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Alexis Sanchez has gone from humble beginnings to earning £600,000-a-week at Manchester United... here are 10 things you don't know about him"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5295737/Henrikh-Mkhitaryan-teases-Arsenal-fans-ahead-move.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Henrikh Mkhitaryan teases Arsenal fans by asking 'what am I getting for my birthday?' as Manchester United playmaker nears move away"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5295295/Man-City-acted-admirably-Alexis-Sanchez-transfer-saga.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Manchester City pulled out of signing Alexis Sanchez knowing they are more attractive than United... it's his loss"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5295273/Alexis-Sanchez-born-play-Manchester-United.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Alexis Sanchez was born to play for Manchester United... he can handle the pressure that comes with the club "></link></item><item><title>Alexis Sanchez on brink of sealing Manchester United move as both he and Henrikh Mkhitaryan head to immigration centre for work permit</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5297411/Sanchez-Mkhitaryan-waiting-green-light.html?ito=rss_msn</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 11:41:56 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">{:value 5297411}</guid><description><![CDATA[Alexis Sanchez is on the brink of completing his mega-money move to Manchester United as he and Henrikh Mkhitaryan push through their work permits.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

In a chilling analysis, he said the Kremlin was a 'clear and present danger' to Europe and predicted that a conflict would 'start with something we don't expect'. In a speech at the Royal United Services Institute, Gen Carter added: 'They are not thousands of miles away, they are now on Europe's doorstep.' Britain's ability to pre-empt or respond to the threats 'will be eroded if we don't match up to them now,' he said. He added: 'Russia could initiate hostilities sooner than we expect.'

Olivia Culpo posted a photo and video of herself as she leapt into the arms of boyfriend Danny Amendola, 32, and straddled the wide receiver, who was responsible for two of the Patriots three touchdowns against the Jaguars. In addition to being mounted by his girlfriend on the field, Amendola's performance also earned him MVP honors for the AFC Championship. The couple had yet another reason to celebrate on Sunday too, with Culpo, 25, revealing just days before that she had landed a much coveted spread in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Becky Freeth</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-22T16:22:04.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Proud Olivia Culpo leaps into Danny Amendola's arms</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-22T16:22:04.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Instagram,SuperBowl</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/13/4874C4E900000578-0-image-a-8_1516628327821.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/12/48734CF100000578-0-image-m-151_1516624511133.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content></item><item><title>'There's a lot of outrage': Stephanie Waring admits confusion over shock Dancing On Ice exit... as Samia Longchambon slams Lorraine for pronouncing partner Sylvain's name incorrectly</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5296877/Dancing-Ice-exit-Stephanie-Waring-admits-confusion.html?ito=rss_msn</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 09:56:23 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">{:value 5296877}</guid><description><![CDATA[The former Dancing on Ice contestant, 39, was quick to point out that fans were left fuming by her sudden exit when she appeared on Lorraine with Sylvain Longchambon on Monday.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

  </video><p class="mol-para-with-font">It has been four months since Megyn Kelly earned the wrath and ire of Jane Fonda for asking the 80-year-old actress about her plastic surgery, and the NBC host is now responding to the backlash.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That moment occurred during Kelly's third episode on September 27 when she asked the Oscar-winner about what work she had done in the past, which prompted a steely Fonda to stare Kelly down and ask: 'We really want to talk about that now?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Since then Fonda has complained about the question to a number of outlets, and even mocked Kelly's question on Today last week during an interview with Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'When she first complained publicly after the program, and repeatedly, I chose to say nothing, as my general philosophy is what other people think of me is none of my business,' said Megyn at the end of her program on Monday. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'However, Fonda was at it again last week, including right here on NBC, and then again elsewhere. So it's time to address the poor-me routine.' </p><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'First, some context. Fonda was on to promote a film about aging. For years she has spoken openly about her joy in giving a cultural face to older women,' Kelly told her studio audience.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Well the truth is most older women look nothing like Fonda, who is now 80. And if Fonda really wants to have an honest discussion about older women's cultural face, then her plastic surgery is tough to ignore.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She continued: 'Fonda herself knows this. She knows this. And that is why, to her credit, she’s discussed her cosmetic surgery pretty much everywhere before coming on our show.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kelly went on to list the many outlets that Fonda has complained to along with the many outlets to which she has previously discussed her plastic surgery.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Today was one of them, with Lily Tomlin joking last week during an interview with Kotb and Guthrie about how long she had known Fonda by stating: 'Oh, my God…I think before your first facelift!' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fonda shot back: 'Who are you, Megyn Kelly?'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">At the moment, all four women erupted in laughter, and the exchange was later posted on social media. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Jane Fonda had quite the response to Lily Tomlin's facelift question, read the caption. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kelly does not seem to be laughing however in the wake of that interview. </p><div class="mol-html" id="mol-8a361270-ff9c-11e7-b719-074218538f37">                            <div><div style="position:relative; padding-bottom:63%; padding-bottom:-webkit-calc(56.25% + 50px); padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 50px); height: 0;">    <iframe style="position:absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.today.com/offsite/megyn-kelly-i-have-no-regrets-about-my-question-to-jane-fonda-1142616131655" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe>  </div></div>                        </div><div>


</div><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Look, I gave her the chance to empower other women, young and old, on a subject which she purports to know well and she rejected it. That’s okay. But I have no regrets about the question,' explained Kelly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Nor am I in the market for a lesson from Jane Fonda on what is and is not appropriate. After all, this is a woman whose name is synonymous with outrage.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is when Kelly launched into Fox News mode. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Look at her treatment of our military during the Vietnam war, many of our veterans still call her "Hanoi Jane" thanks to her radio broadcasts which attempted to shame American troops. She posed on an anti-aircraft gun used to shoot down our pilots,' stated Kelly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'She called our POW's "hypocrites and liars" and referred to their torture as understandable. Even she had to apologize years later for that gun picture - but not for the rest of it.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She then closed out by saying: 'By the way she still says she's not proud of America. So, the moral indignation is a little much. She put her plastic surgery out there. She said she wanted to discuss the plight of older women in America. And honestly she has no business lecturing anyone on what qualifies as offensive.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kelly's claim is inaccurate however, with Fonda apologizing directly to a group of Vietnam veterans in 2015 while appearing at an event in Maryland.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Whenever possible I try to sit down with vets and talk with them, because I understand and it makes me sad,' Fonda told those assembled at the Weinberg Center for Arts according to <a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fredericknewspost.com/z/content_type/news_article/jane-fonda-met-with-protest-in-frederick-hopes-for-open/article_f76347a9-d99c-56d1-85a8-af1bc5432524.html">The Frederick News-Post</a>. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It hurts me and it will to my grave that I made a huge, huge mistake that made a lot of people think I was against the soldiers.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She later described herself as a 'lightening rod' to many, like to 50 protesters outside the venue that evening who carried signs reading: 'Forgive? Maybe. Forget?

  </video><p class="mol-para-with-font">In what looked at the time to be an ill-advised and poorly conceived move, Kelly decided to ask the actress to detail the plastic surgery she has had done over the year back in September.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You, you've been an example to everyone, on how to age beautifully and with strength. And unapologetically,' began Kelly, nervously drawing out her question.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You admit you had work done. I think it's to your credit. You look amazing. Have you ... why did you say .. I read you felt you're not proud to admit you had work done, why not?' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">That is when Fonda asked why they were discussing the subject.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Kelly tried her best to salvage the question, with Fonda at that point glancing over to her guest Robert Redford in disbelief that she was being asked that question while out promoting the pair's new film, 'Our Souls at Night.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Well, one of the things people think about when they look at you, is how amazing you look,' said Kelly.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A composed-as-ever but noticeably chilly Fonda at that point demurred: 'Thanks. Good attitude. Good posture. Take care of myself.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She then took control of the interview from Kelly by telling the host: 'Let me tell you why I love this movie that we did, "Our Souls at Night," rather than plastic surgery.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Redford then looked at his co-star and showed his support for her by laughing and saying: 'Back to that, huh.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fonda then launched into her own talk about the film, no longer waiting or wanting to take one of Kelly's questions.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You kind of have a choice in life, when you get to be close to 80, or even before then, what you want to do with your life. And my character, Addie, in this movie, she knows there's a lot more time behind her than in front,' explained Fonda.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And she doesn't want to go down lonely and scared. She's been a widow, living in this house by herself. And she's lonely and scared. And she's a shy person, who is not someone who would normally do this. But she girds her loins and decides...'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Redford jumped in saying: 'That's where I come in.

As long as I've known Jane, she always has been moving forward. And doesn't look back,' said Redford.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'And whatever pain, whatever problem she's had in the past, remains in the past. And she keeps moving forward. It's an admirable quality. And few people have it like Jane does.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The rest of the interview was a wash, with Kelly getting no response from Fonda when she launched into a bit about how she was an aerobics instructor for 10 years shortly after the actress released her bestselling exercise tapes.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And to close it all out, Fonda drove home just how little she cared for Megyn's questions and how proud she was of her looks and how she has aged when the host asked her guests: 'On behalf of our audience member, Victoria wanted to ask, if you could go back to any age in your life, what would it be? I ask that to both of you.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Fonda very curtly replied: 'Right now. I wouldn't want any other time.' </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The actress has indeed spoken about procedures she has had done in the past, but only while promoting her fitness and wellness projects.   </p>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>The host criticized Fonda for her actions during the Vietnam War four decades ago on her now infamous trip to Hanoi, and then claimed that the actress had yet to apologize for her 1972 tour of North Vietnam. That claim is questionable at best, with Fonda stating multiple times that she regrets ever giving off the impression that she did not support US troops. Fonda did not need to defend herself however, with a host of celebs coming to her aid and quickly going after Kelly. 'Megyn Kelly is a moron - spineless wanna be barbie - she sucks and so does her show,' wrote Rosie O'Donnell. 'What a moron this woman is,' noted Rosanna Arquette. And Kelly's very first guest on Today, Debra Messing, said: 'This is disgusting.

I've always been motivated by this club, by their red colours, which have always stood out for me and I'm genuinely saying this from the heart when I tell you that this is like a dream come true for me, playing for Manchester United. It makes me feel really happy and I'm so pleased to be here at the 'Theatre of Dreams' as everyone calls it!</p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><strong>How big a part of this is Jose Mourinho? </strong></p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He indicated it is important for the club for me to be here.

My standard response is to tell people to play things straight up and I did not receive a copy of the report.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first victim to speak on Monday was Bailey Lorencen,

class="mol-para-with-font">Lorencen revealed that she began seeing Nassar after she broke her neck in four places following a fall, which Geddert at the time assured her was just a muscle injury.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The sexual abuse began soon after and lasted until Nassar told the young woman she had to stop gymnastics or she might never walk again. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'While it was happening, you said it was a medical treatment,' Lorencen said, adding that many of the young girls she spoke with described receiving similar treatments from Nassar. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She said that she now has nightmares and is terrified that men are going to rape her while she sleeps, along with anxiety. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Lorencen also earned a rare objection from the defense when she called out Nassar's attorney for smiling and laughing in court with him last week.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I'm so confused by your career path and I do not respect you or your choices,' she said to Nassar's legal team. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The MSU alum also stated:

  </video>]]></content:encoded><dc:abstract>A new trailer allegedly for a Friends movie circulated on the internet over the weekend - sending fans into an excited flurry wondering, could it be?  Since the show that started Jennifer Aniston's career went off the air in 2004 - fans have been hoping it would return for reunion season or movie - like Sex and the City did in 2008. And on Friday a trailer surfaced on YouTube that made it seem like that might finally be happening 14 years later. Fans reacted enthusiastically to the news on social media over the weekend - with many questioning if it was real but expressing their excitement regardless.  But unfortunately, the trailer is a hoax.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Abigail Miller</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-22T14:41:16.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Fans go crazy over a viral 'trailer for a new Friends movie'</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-22T14:41:16.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Jennifer Aniston,YouTube</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/01/486D3E5600000578-0-image-a-49_1516583155469.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/01/486CED9300000578-0-image-a-64_1516583678080.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5295459/24th-Annual-SAG-Awards-red-carpet-piece.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Sparkle is the new black!

Ms Madden claims she slathered 'a very thick layer' of Banana Boat 'sport' 50+ suncream (inset) all over her skin 30 minutes before heading to a popular beach last month. But despite reapplying after getting out of the water, she claims the skin on her back erupted with massive fluid-filled blisters which needed hospital treatment – and is still scarlet three weeks later. Banana Boat have apologised to Sarah but said customers can be reassured their products provide 'safe and effective sun protection'.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>Caters New Agency</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Brianne Tolj</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-23T00:25:14.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Woman says Banana Boat sunscreen left her covered in blisters</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-23T00:25:14.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/02/486E1CD900000578-0-image-a-45_1516587333576.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/02/486DAEE000000578-0-image-a-40_1516586890974.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1006512</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Caters News Agency</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5269183/Woman-left-rash-using-Cancer-Council-sunscreen.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Woman is left with 'itchy red marks' all over her back after having a bad reaction to Cancer Council sunscreen"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5287003/Bondi-Beach-packed-Sydney-heatwave.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Cheeky locals swarm Bondi Beach to soak up the sunshine as a scorching 40 degree heatwave takes hold of Australia"></link></item><item><title>'My face was broken into pieces': Doctor who was mercilessly bashed by a gang while walking back from the Australian Open with his son reveals his horrific injuries and thanks first responders for 'saving his life'</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5297147/Doctor-bashed-Australian-Open-reveals-horrific-injuries.html?ito=rss_msn</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 11:21:55 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">{:value 5297147}</guid><description><![CDATA[Dr Edmund Pribikin was walking through Melbourne's Queen Victoria Gardens with his son Edik on Wednesday night when he was bashed by a 'gang' of teens who smashed his face in.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

But when they tried to sell up in October last year, 27-year-old marketing manager Nathan came across the game-changing clause.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Phoebe Southworth</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-22T18:25:22.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Leasehold clause is trapping newlyweds in house they want to sell</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-22T18:25:22.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/15/486773E000000578-0-image-a-34_1516547822854.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/21/15/48637D9200000578-0-image-a-35_1516547825193.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5296005/Gran-strangled-daughters-killer-denied-compensation.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Grandmother, 81, who was strangled and left for dead by the man who'd just raped and murdered her daughter is denied compensation because her injuries were not severe enough"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5245127/Britons-bombarded-2-2bn-nuisance-phone-calls.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Britons were bombarded with 2.2 billion nuisance phone calls and texts last year - that's 4,200 a MINUTE "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5200525/Law-ban-practice-exploiting-home-buyers-announced.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Rip-off leases on new houses are banned: Law to ban 'feudal' practice that exploits buyers to be announced by Sajid Javid"></link></item><item><title>Iranian Embassy SAS hero who is now homeless says terrorist in 1980 siege 'should still be in prison' and NOT in a council house </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5296933/Homeless-SAS-hero-says-terrorist-prison.html?ito=rss_msn</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 09:13:01 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">{:value 5296933}</guid><description><![CDATA[Bob Curry, 64, (left) who stormed the Iranian Embassy during the 1980 siege is now homeless, while Fowzi Nejad, 61, (right) the only terrorist to survive, lives on benefits in a council house.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) took legal action against Martin Baker Aircraft Ltd over a breach of law, relating to the death of Flight Lieutenant Cunningham at the base in Lincolnshire. Flt Lt Cunningham died on November 8, 2011, when the ejection seat suddenly engaged while his Hawk T1 aircraft was still on the runway. The Iraq veteran was hurled up to 300ft into the air before plunging to the ground at the RAF aerobatics team's base at RAF Scampton, near Lincoln. The main parachute on the Mk 10 Martin Baker seat, which should have saved his life, failed to deploy and he suffered multiple injuries (inset, the smashed canopy). At Lincolnshire Crown Court today (right his sister Nicky and parents Monika and Jim arriving at court), statutory director of ejector seat manufacturer Martin-Baker Aircraft Ltd, John Martin, pleaded guilty on behalf of the company at  to Section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Anthony Joseph</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-22T16:31:06.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Ejection manufacturer pleads guilty over death of Red Arrows pilot</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-22T16:31:06.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Breaking News</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/11/4872942A00000578-0-image-a-58_1516620780806.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/11/03DFE586000003E8-0-image-m-42_1516620217475.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1191238</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>SWNS.com </mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5297063/Coroner-detective-death-grandfather-54.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Coroner slams woman detective 'acting as judge and jury' over death of grandfather, 54, who was 'hounded to his suicide' and told by police to 'man up' after being accused of historic sex abuse"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5296843/Police-SHOOT-DEAD-abandoned-dog-tied-post.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Police SHOOT DEAD abandoned dog tied to a telegraph post after officers were unable to 'calm' snarling animal "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5296889/Terrifying-moment-driver-confronted-HGV.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Near-miss!

The IT manager's Vauxhall Astra car hurtled across a busy junction and ploughed into Helena Thurm (right; and centre, with her brother Mike) as she was crossing the road following a job interview. The 25-year-old former grammar school pupil was thrown into the air by the force of the impact and suffered multiple injuries, before dying the following day in hospital. In a tragic twist, her parents drove past the scene of the collision and saw Wall talking to police at the roadside - but had no idea their daughter was the victim. Today, the victim's family accused him of using his car like a 'killing machine' and condemned his 'selfish and thoughtless actions to get home quicker through traffic'.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Mark Duell</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-22T18:43:38.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>'Selfish' driver who killed graduate is jailed for 2 years</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-22T18:43:38.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Manchester</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/18/4877A9FF00000578-0-image-a-3_1516646023102.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/14/48744E5D00000578-0-image-a-122_1516632212576.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1175339</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5296989/Audi-driver-smashed-man-19-landed-50-yards-away.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Audi driver smashes into pedestrian, 19, and hurls him 50 yards along the street in horror hit-and-run which has left him in a wheelchair unable to walk "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5290983/Smart-motorway-horror-sees-lorry-crash-familys-car.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Parents relive the horrific moment a lorry smashed in to their broken down VW van at up to 60mph on a stretch of motorway with NO hard shoulder"></link></item><item><title>'I could see sadness in his face and eyes': Former college classmate of one of the older House of Horrors children says he wore the same clothes every day, avoided eye contact and once scarfed down food at a school potluck </title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5294455/Ex-classmate-House-Horrors-son-recalls-sadness.html?ito=rss_msn</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2018 14:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">{:value 5294455}</guid><description><![CDATA[The former college classmate to one of the elder sons victimized in the California House of Horrors has described into harrowing detail her past observances of him.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

West was found dead in the street outside her family home in Calera, Alabama, on January 13 around 5am. Calera Police Chief Sean Lemley said the case is being treated as a homicide but has not revealed the cause of her death. It's been nine days since West was found dead and police have still remained silent, leaving neighbors baffled as to what is going on in the case. West ran a subscription-only website where she went by the name Kitty Kat West. That is the name she used for herself on Twitter and on a fan page where customers paid $15.99-a-month to access explicit photographs and videos.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Valerie Edwards</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-23T02:16:23.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Devastated mom breaks her silence over murder of daughter Dawn West</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-23T02:16:23.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/02/487A923400000578-0-image-a-25_1516673775730.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/00/485390FE00000578-0-image-m-16_1516669133742.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5290259/Murdered-Alabama-mother-explicit-subscription-website.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Mystery murder of married mother, 42, who led a double life as an 'online exhibitionist' with a $15.99-a-month subscription website before she was found dead and half-naked in street outside her Alabama home"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5279457/Killer-convicted-strangling-girl-17-death.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Killer is jailed for at least 26 years for strangling girl, 17, to death in 'snuff movie fantasy' and hiding her body in clingfilm-wrapped wardrobe just three days after he was freed from prison "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/01/kat_wests_death_what_we_know_a.html#incart_most-read_" title="Kat West's death: What we know about Alabama mother who operated adult website | AL.com"></link></item><item><title>Writhing mass of RATS that 'jump for the throat' shock Paris as surging numbers of the vermin gather near tourists spots</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5296905/Writhing-mass-RATS-shock-Paris.html?ito=rss_msn</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 09:48:51 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">{:value 5296905}</guid><description><![CDATA[The video was taken on the banks of the River Seine, in the centre of all the most popular tourist spots in Paris, including Notre Dame Cathedral and the Orsay art gallery.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

The papers were filed to a Los Angeles court on January 17, and parties are expected to go before a judge next week. Simpson was famously acquitted of the double murder of Nicole and Ron in 1995, but a civil court jury in 1997 found Simpson liable for their deaths and ordered him to pay $33.5 million in damages to their families.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Hannah Parry</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-23T09:53:04.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>OJ Simpson responds to Fred Goldman's suit</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-23T09:53:04.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>OJ Simpson</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/01/487A519F00000578-0-image-a-5_1516670034338.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/22/4878BB8700000578-0-image-m-31_1516659440139.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5285439/Lawyer-OJ-Simpson-golfing-lot-stay-Las-Vegas.html?ito=rss_msn" title="O.J.

But a new 3D film by Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson is set to bring the conflict to life in a way never seen before. The Oscar-winner has restored and colourised 100-year-old footage from the Imperial War Museum's vast archive, and early photos suggest the results will be remarkable. One comparison shot shows the dramatic transformation from poor quality black-and-white scenes to clear colour images, while another shows the radically sharpened faces of our troops. Jackson said he hoped the film, which will premiere at the BFI London Film Festival before airing on BBC1 later this year, will help audiences better connect 'with the events on screen'.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Khaleda Rahman</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-22T19:51:02.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Peter Jackson transforms grainy WWI footage to make new film</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-22T19:51:02.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/18/4877B09600000578-0-image-a-3_1516645725656.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/18/48723D7C00000578-0-image-a-21_1516645876136.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5288605/Buckingham-Palace-revamp-uncovers-Victorian-era-clipping.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Frozen in time: Workmen renovating the Queen’s apartments in Buckingham Palace uncover fascinating detritus from Victoria’s reign – including cigarette packs and a 130-year-old newspaper"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5297289/The-British-women-conquered-Sahara.html?ito=rss_msn" title="The British women who conquered the Sahara: Daring duo were the first in the world to cross the desert on motorbikes in 1934 (despite not having a compass) "></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5296273/Tokyo-simulates-military-attack-WWII-amid-N-Korea-threat.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Tokyo holds its first military attack evacuation drill since WWII as tensions rise over North Korea's nuclear programme"></link></item><item><title>Daughter won secret injunction to stop her Alzheimer’s sufferer father marrying his partner of 20 years as it would mean the new wife would inherit much of his £1.7m fortune</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5300457/Daughter-won-secret-injunction-stop-father-marrying.html?ito=rss_msn</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2018 01:52:02 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">{:value 5300457}</guid><description><![CDATA[The daughter of a retired insurance broker in his 80s went to the High Court last year in search of a secret court injunction that would ban her father from marrying.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Senate Democrats accepted a deal to reopen the government on Monday, after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged to take up immigration legislation – including a permanent fix for the controversial DACA program – in the next three weeks. The final 81-18 Senate tally was a far cry from the crashing failure of a similar measure on Friday that saw handfuls of Senators from both parties crossing the aisle but fall well short of the 60 votes needed for passage. When the dust settled, 33 of the 49 Democrats had voted to turn the lights back on. Republican Sen. John McCain, ailing with brain cancer, was absent.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>David Martosko</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-23T02:48:47.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>House votes to end shutdown after Senate agreement</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-23T02:48:47.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>Democrats,Donald Trump,Breaking News</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/18/4877C4A000000578-0-image-a-37_1516646720831.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/16/4875EB1500000578-0-image-m-8_1516638328251.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5296495/Mitch-McConnell-calls-end-government-shutdown.html?ito=rss_msn" title="'Not good!'

On February 18 he was charged with a series of sex offences against the woman. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The next day he appeared at court and was granted bail until his trial. But he was forced out of his home and ended up in a hostel for drug addicts and the homeless.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Eventually his daughters rented him a one bedroom flat and he returned to work as a delivery driver for Asda.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But his alleged victim's partner started turning up at the store and then driving slowly past Mr Bailey's flat, on one occasion with the woman in his car.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He reported four incidents of harassment, but no officers visited him. He became increasingly 'jittery' and 'tearful' fearing he would be re-arrested for breaching his bail, though he had done nothing wrong.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Ms Khali-Khan, who joined South Yorkshire Police in 2003, was a detective constable at the time with two years' experience in the criminal investigation department. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Last year she was promoted to Acting Detective Inspector.

She said they had a 'lengthy conversation', but her notes ran to just seven lines.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She could not remember Mr Bailey saying he was scared for his safety or that she told him 'no law had been broken'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">She claimed he only asked her to have 'words of advice' with the man. The coroner said he doubted her version of events. She denied telling Mr Bailey to 'man up'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Dr Hunter asked why she had not fully investigated the intimidation or a possible case of perverting the course of justice that could have affected legal proceedings.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'You did not take him seriously, you dismissed him,' he told the officer. 'I put it to you that you had already acted as judge and jury and had already formed an opinion about Mr Bailey's guilt.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'I disagree with that,' replied Ms Khali-Khan.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Over the following weeks Mr Bailey was subjected to more harassment, but did not report it. He lost faith in the justice system and his depression deepened.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">On May 19, 2010 Mr Bailey drove to the Derbyshire village of Miller's Dale. He left a note in his car which said: 'I'm scared to do this.

Tran is said to have been ‘mean-spirited’ and ‘exploitative’ and sent messages on Instagram to the 12-year-old daughter of a Snctm founder which left her upset. According to a profile in Esquire Tran is 34-year-old Vietnamese immigrant and was the very first person to buy a Snctm membership. He described himself as sexually repressed until he attended one of the events and is now so liberated that he wears a black leather mask and rabbit ears when he’s partying. The founder of SNCTM previously claimed its members include Grammy-winning artists and said Gwyneth Paltrow (seen inset) has attended their parties with her Glee producer fiance, Brad Falchuk.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Michelle Curran</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-23T06:10:44.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Bunnyman BANNED from Hollywood’s most elite sex club</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-23T06:10:44.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/05/487C02BC00000578-0-image-a-26_1516684226005.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/23/05/487C02D100000578-0-image-m-31_1516684233340.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5300755/Porn-star-Stormy-Daniels-Instagram-account-suspended.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Porn star Stormy Daniels' Instagram account is suspended just days after she stripped off for the start of her 'Make America Horny Again' tour"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5299129/Prosecutors-seek-21-month-sentence-Pauls-neighbor.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Prosecutors to seek 21-month sentence for Rand Paul's neighbor who tackled him in the front yard and broke six of the senator's ribs after a dispute over the state of his lawn"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/sex/a49689/snctm-sex-club-masquerade/" title="The Last Hour Inside the Masquerade Party at Snctm Sex Club (NSFW)"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="https://www.instagram.com/snctm_bunnyman/?hl=en" title="法王 (@snctm_bunnyman) • Instagram photos and videos"></link><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://sanctumclub.org/" title="sanctumclub.org/"></link></item><item><title>Another Kollection?

Up to a foot of snow fell in Scotland and on hilltops in northern England over the weekend, but it also covered fields as far south as the Cotswolds and Home Counties. It will now turn to slush as the mercury rises nationwide. In the Highlands, a landslide caused an early-morning train to derail, although only five passengers were believed to have been on board the 6.03am service from Mallaig to Glasgow Queen Street when it came off the track (pictured). The slip resulted in the line being blocked between Arisaig and Glenfinnan, Lochaber. No one was hurt, but rail operator ScotRail said services between Fort William and Mallaig will not run for the rest of the day.</dc:abstract><dc:publisher>MailOnline</dc:publisher><dc:creator>Lara Keay</dc:creator><dc:modified>2018-01-22T17:10:34.000Z</dc:modified><mi:shortTitle>Temperatures rise by 10 degrees as Melting Monday covers UK in sludge</mi:shortTitle><mi:dateTimeWritten>2018-01-22T17:10:34.000Z</mi:dateTimeWritten><media:keywords>UK Weather,Met Office</media:keywords><media:content url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/14/4875555800000578-0-image-a-120_1516631782589.jpg"><media:thumbnail url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/01/22/11/4872EE7200000578-0-image-a-53_1516622260569.jpg" type="image/jpeg"></media:thumbnail><mi:hasSyndicationRights>0</mi:hasSyndicationRights><mi:licenseId>1870125</mi:licenseId><mi:licensorName>ScotRail / SWNS.com</mi:licensorName></media:content><link rel="related" type="text/html" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5294213/The-Queen-royals-head-church-Castle-Rising.html?ito=rss_msn" title="Singing in the reign!

Look closely at the signs on the road that show you the speed limit. The number indicated is the maximum speed you can travel. Whether you're on foot, bike or car,' they wrote.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'2. Try to locate your car's speedometer. You normally find it somewhere in front of the driver's seat, on the dashboard. It has an arrow pointing to the number that reflects the car's speed. On newer cars, the speed is sometimes displayed digitally, with numbers.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'3. This last point is also the hardest. Adjust your speed according to the number shown on the road sign. The police can not fine you if you do not drive over this number.'</p><div>
